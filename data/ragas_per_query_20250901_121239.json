      "question": "What does the UNCTAD Technology and Innovation Report 2025 say about AI?",
      "answer": "The **Technology and Innovation Report 2025** by UNCTAD focuses on the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and its implications for sustainable development. Here are some key insights from the report:\n\n1. **AI as a Frontier Technology**: The report emphasizes that AI is reshaping economies and societies, presenting both opportunities and challenges. While it has the potential to accelerate progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), there is a significant risk that its benefits may not be evenly distributed, potentially exacerbating existing inequalities.\n\n2. **Need for Inclusive Policies**: To harness AI effectively, the report advocates for the design of national policies that promote inclusive technological progress. This involves addressing gaps in digital infrastructure, data access, and skills development. The report identifies three critical leverage points: infrastructure, data, and skills, which are essential for fostering an environment where AI can contribute positively to economic growth and decent work.\n\n3. **Global Collaboration**: The report underscores the importance of international cooperation in developing a governance framework for AI. Such collaboration is necessary to ensure that AI technologies are directed towards shared prosperity and that they create public goods. The focus should shift from merely advancing technology to prioritizing human development and equity.\n\n4. **Economic and Workforce Dynamics**: The report also explores how AI can impact productivity and workforce dynamics. It highlights the need for policies that not only support the adoption of AI but also ensure that workers are empowered and that economic growth translates into equitable income distribution.\n\n5. **Ethical Oversight**: Ethical considerations are paramount in the deployment of AI technologies. The report calls for transparency and ethical oversight to guide the development and application of AI, ensuring that it serves the broader goals of society rather than just the interests of a few.\n\nIn summary, the **Technology and Innovation Report 2025** presents a comprehensive analysis of AI's role in development, advocating for inclusive policies, global collaboration, and ethical governance to ensure that the benefits of AI are widely shared and contribute to sustainable development.

However, their rapid and widespread diffusion is often outpacing the ability of many Governments to respond. The Technology and Innovation Report 2025: Inclusive Artificial Intelligence for Development surveys the complex artificial intelligence landscape, aiming to help decision makers design science, technology and innovation policies that foster inclusive technological progress. The use of artificial intelligence has the potential to accelerate progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, but if unevenly distributed and not guided by ethical oversight and transparency, its diffusion can exacerbate existing inequalities. The report analyses the requirements and policies needed at all stages, from development to adoption, to foster inclusive technological progress for sustainable development. This requires a multidimensional and evidence-based approach. For this purpose, three key leverage points \u2013 infrastructure, data and skills \u2013 are identified, offering a broad socioeconomic perspective and highlighting the need to build resilient infrastructure and promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and innovation. Technology and Innovation Report 2025 Inclusive Artificial Intelligence for Development Overview v The report starts by documenting the significant concentration in artificial intelligence development in a few companies and countries and identifies extensive gaps in digital infrastructure that risk widening inequalities both within and among countries. Then it explores productivity and workforce dynamics focusing on economic growth and decent work. From a national perspective, the report analyses the requirements and policies needed to support adoption, adaptation and development of artificial intelligence. From an international perspective, it considers the need for global artificial intelligence governance to steer artificial intelligence towards inclusive and equitable development, emphasizing the importance of international collaboration. History has shown that while technological progress drives economic growth, it does not on its own ensure equitable income distribution or promote inclusive human development. Stronger international cooperation can shift the focus from technology to people, enabling countries to co-create a global artificial intelligence framework. Such a framework should prioritize shared prosperity, create public goods and place humanity at the heart of artificial intelligence development.

      "question": "What peacekeeping challenges are mentioned in Security Council reports?",
      "answer": "In the context of recent Security Council reports, several peacekeeping challenges have been highlighted, particularly in relation to the ongoing conflicts and the effectiveness of peacekeeping operations.\n\n1. **Implementation of Sanctions and Humanitarian Law**: One significant challenge noted in the draft report from the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations is the need for United Nations sanctions to be implemented in full compliance with international humanitarian law. The report emphasizes the importance of the humanitarian carveout in sanctions regimes, which aims to allow humanitarian assistance to flow despite sanctions. However, there are concerns about overcompliance by financial institutions and other actors, which can hinder the delivery of humanitarian aid. The report mentions that while there have been some improvements in reducing delays faced by humanitarian actors, the complexities of sanctions still pose a significant challenge to peacekeeping efforts, particularly in conflict zones like the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Sudan [1].\n\n2. **Fragmentation of Armed Actors**: The draft report concerning the situation in Sudan outlines the fragmentation and proliferation of armed groups as a critical challenge. The dynamics of violence in Darfur, characterized by competing military strategies among the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), and various militias, complicate peacekeeping efforts. This fragmentation leads to widespread displacement and violations of international humanitarian law, making it difficult for peacekeeping missions to operate effectively and maintain stability [2].\n\n3. **Lack of Independent Monitoring Mechanisms**: The absence of panels of experts in certain sanctions regimes, as noted in the Special Committee report, presents another challenge. Without these independent monitoring bodies, there is a lack of oversight and clarity regarding the implementation of sanctions, which can undermine the effectiveness of peacekeeping operations. The report highlights that sanctions committees are mandated to monitor compliance, but the absence of expert panels can lead to gaps in enforcement and accountability [1].\n\n4. **Need for Comprehensive Reviews**: The Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations has been tasked with conducting a comprehensive review of peacekeeping operations. This ongoing review process indicates that there are recognized gaps and challenges in current peacekeeping strategies that need to be addressed to enhance their effectiveness. The discussions during the Committee's sessions reflect a consensus on the need for improved working methods and strategies to adapt to the evolving nature of conflicts [3].\n\nThese challenges underscore the complexities faced by peacekeeping operations in fulfilling their mandates and highlight the need for ongoing dialogue and reform within the UN framework to address these issues effectively. Would you like to delve deeper into any specific aspect of these challenges or explore potential solutions discussed in the reports?",

        "w was expressed that United Nations sanctions were to be implemented in full compliance with international humanitarian law, and the adoption of Security Council resolution 2761 (2024) was noted with appreciation. The Secretariat was asked about the impact of the humanitarian carveout to United Nations sanctions regimes, implementation challenges, and potential solutions. The representative of the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs explained that sanctions committees were required to adopt Implementation Assistance Notices and underscored the need to increase awareness of the standing humanitarian exemption. In relation to challenges to implementation, a possible risk of overcompliance by financial institutions and other actors was noted, but the representative explained that the Emergency Relief Coordinator had observed that there had been a reduction in some delays that humanitarian actors faced to deliver or carry out their activities. 18. In the context of the termination of the mandate of the Panel of Experts for the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1718 (2006), the Secretariat was asked about the implementation challenges in connection with regimes with and without panels of experts and whether any specific challenges had emerged regarding the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea sanctions regime since the Panel\u2019s termination. The representative of the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs explained that sanctions committees were mandated by the Council to monitor the implementation of sanctions, and she noted that, where there was no panel of experts, the regimes lacked an independent monitoring mechanism. It was also noted that panels were often contacted for clarification regarding the implementation of sanction regimes.",

Introduction 1. In paragraph 2 of its resolution 2725 (2024), the Security Council requested the Panel of Experts on the Sudan to provide to the Council, after discussion with the Committee, a final report by 13 January 2025 with its findings and recommendations. In the present report, the Panel outlines its findings. 2. The Panel visited Port Sudan in November 2024. It held meetings with members of the Darfurian armed movements signatories to the Juba Peace Agreement, General Ibrahim Gabir \u2013\u2060 a member of the Transitional Sovereign Council, as well as members of the General Intelligence Service, the Humanitarian Aid Commission, the Military Intelligence Service, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of the Interior, the National Coordination Mechanism,1 the Peace Commission and the Unit to Combat Violence Against Children and Women. The Panel wishes to express its appreciation to the Government of the Sudan for the support it received during the reporting period and its visit to Port Sudan. 3. In addition, the Panel held meetings and conducted telephone interviews with a number of interlocutors, including members of the Government of the Sudan, the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the Darfurian armed movements, both signatories and non-signatories to the Juba Peace Agreement, as well as representatives of civil society, including internally displaced persons, refugees, victims and eyewitnesses of violence, women\u2019s organizations and members of local communities. It also met with representatives from United Nations agencies and programmes and the diplomatic community. During its mandate, the Panel conducted visits to Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda and the United Arab Emirates. Unfortunately, despite official correspondence and engagements in New York with the Permanent Mission of Chad to the United Nations, Chad did not respond to the Panel\u2019s request to visit the border areas with Darfur. 4. The Panel worked in full conformity with the best practices and methods recommended by the Security Council Informal Working Group on General Issues of Sanctions (see S/2006/997) (see annex 1). II. Conflict dynamics A. Fragmentation and proliferation of armed actors and their war strategies 5. The fragmentation and proliferation of armed actors, as well as the overlap of military and civilian spaces, shaped the dynamics of violence. This led to widespread displacement and violations of international humanitarian law. 1. SAF and the SAF-aligned joint forces 6. In 2024, the conflict in Darfur was defined by contrasting military strategies as SAF, RSF and SAF-aligned joint forces2 vied to secure and consolidate control in the region. SAF, with a limited physical presence \u2013 primarily a small contingent stationed in El Fasher \u2013 relied heavily on SAF-aligned joint forces and allied militias to conduct __________________ 1 The mechanism that facilitated the Panel\u2019s visit to Port Sudan. 2 A force comprising members of a number of signatory groups to the Juba Peace Agreement, including the Sudan Liberation Army-Minni Minawi (SLA/MM), the Justice and Equality Movement-Gibril Ibrahim (JEM), the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army Transitional Council- Osman Abdul Jabar (SLA/TC/Osman Abdul Jabar faction) and the Sudan Liberation Forces- Abdallah Janna (GSLF-Janna faction).

Peaceful settlement of disputes 1. The Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization considered the question of the peaceful settlement of disputes during the general exchange of views held at its 312th and 313th meetings, on 18 February 2025, and during the 2nd meeting of the Working Group of the Whole, on 20 February. 2. During the general exchange of views and in the Working Group of the Whole, delegations expressed their support for all efforts to promote the peaceful settlement of disputes. Delegations recalled that States should refrain from the threat or use of force and instead settle disputes by peaceful means pursuant to Articles 2, paragraph 3, and 33 of the Charter of the United Nations. 3. Delegations highlighted the significance of the Manila Declaration on the Peaceful Settlement of International Disputes1 and the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.2 Several delegations emphasized the right of States to choose freely a peaceful means to settle international disputes and maintained that those means should be used in good faith and on the basis of the mutual consent of the parties to the dispute, and should not be subject to abuse. 4. Several delegations asserted the importance of preventive diplomacy in conflict prevention and the peaceful settlement of disputes. Several delegations also pointed out the importance of multilateralism and the role of regional arrangements in the peaceful settlement of disputes. 5. Several delegations reaffirmed the role of the International Court of Justice, as the principal judicial organ of the United Nations, in promoting the peaceful __________________ 1 General Assembly resolution 37/10, annex. 2 General Assembly resolution 2625 (XXV), annex. A/AC.182/2025/L.6 25-02951 2/3 settlement of disputes. The usefulness of the Court\u2019s advisory opinions on legal questions was also noted. Some delegations expressed their views on particular proceedings before the Court and stressed the importance of the implementation of the decisions of international adjudicative bodies. 6. A number of delegations stated that the annual thematic debate on the means for the settlement of disputes contributed to the more efficient and effective use of peaceful means and promoted a culture of peace among Member States, and they voiced their support for the Special Committee\u2019s continuing to analyse all means envisaged in Article 33 of the Charter. A number of delegations encouraged Member States to actively take part in the annual thematic debate and share their best practices and successful examples regarding the use of peaceful means of dispute settlement. 7. Delegations reiterated their preference that, in accordance with the mandate of the Special Committee, the question of the peaceful settlement of disputes remain on its agenda. A. Means for the settlement of disputes: exchange of information on State practices regarding the use of procedures envisaged in the Charter and other international instruments 8. In accordance with paragraph 5 (a) of General Assembly resolution 79/125, delegations focused their debate on the subtopic \u201cExchange of information on State practices regarding the use of procedures envisaged in the Charter and other international instruments\u201d. Reference was made to the document entitled \u201cExplanatory note by the Non-Aligned Movement on the identification of \u2018other peaceful means\u2019 of pacific settlement of disputes in Article 33 (1) of the Charter of the United Nations adopted in paragraph 5 (b) of General Assembly resolution 77/109\u201d (A/AC.182/L.162). 9. Delegations reiterated the importance that they attached to all peaceful means for the settlement of international disputes and supported efforts in promoting such means. Several delegations observed that the Charter of the United Nations, in particular Article 33, and the Manila Declaration on the Peaceful Settlement of International Disputes of 1982 provided a comprehensive toolkit of non-judicial means for the peaceful settlement of disputes. It was recalled that the list of means in Article 33 of the Charter was not an exhaustive one. General Assembly resolution 57/26, entitled \u201cPrevention and peaceful settlement of disputes\u201d was also recalled."

      "question": "How do UN reports address women's economic empowerment?",
      "answer": "Women's economic empowerment is a significant focus in various UN reports, reflecting a comprehensive approach to addressing gender equality and the empowerment of women. Here\u2019s a synthesis of how different reports tackle this critical issue:\n\n1. **UN-Women's Strategic Plan (2022-2025)**: The report highlights UN-Women's efforts to create positive social norms that support women's economic participation. It emphasizes the importance of engaging men and boys in challenging discriminatory norms that hinder women's access to paid employment and unpaid care work. For instance, in countries like Egypt, Jordan, and Morocco, UN-Women facilitated community dialogues to question and change these norms, which is crucial for fostering an environment where women can thrive economically [1].\n\n2. **Private Sector Engagement**: The report also notes significant strides in engaging the private sector to promote gender-responsive legislation and policies. UN-Women collaborated with governments and private companies to establish initiatives like a $25 million fund in Nigeria aimed at combating gender-based violence, which directly impacts women's economic stability. Additionally, partnerships with the advertising industry through the Unstereotype Alliance have shown that inclusive advertising can drive sales, thereby benefiting women entrepreneurs and businesses [1].\n\n3. **Access to Resources**: The reports underscore the need for equitable access to services, goods, and resources essential for women's livelihoods. For example, in Tanzania, UN-Women supported initiatives to secure women's land ownership, which is vital for economic empowerment. The issuance of land ownership certificates is a step towards addressing gender disparities in land rights, where men typically own significantly more land than women [1].\n\n4. **Global Commitments**: The draft ministerial declaration from the Economic and Social Council emphasizes the importance of economic participation and leadership for women. It commits to promoting women's access to entrepreneurship, financial inclusion, and decent work. This includes addressing the unequal distribution of unpaid care work and ensuring that women have access to credit and resources necessary for economic independence [4].\n\n5. **UNICEF's Gender Action Plan**: UNICEF's report highlights its commitment to empowering girls and women through education, health, and protection initiatives. It stresses the importance of partnerships with governments and civil society to enhance opportunities for women and girls, particularly in humanitarian settings. The focus on scaling up health and nutrition initiatives and supporting female community workers is crucial for fostering economic empowerment [5].\n\nIn summary, UN reports collectively address women's economic empowerment through a multi-faceted approach that includes changing social norms, engaging the private sector, ensuring access to resources, and committing to global frameworks that support women's rights and economic participation. These efforts are essential for achieving broader sustainable development goals and ensuring that women can fully participate in and benefit from economic opportunities.",

        "e 3: Positive social norms, including through engaging men and boys 38. Discriminatory social norms remain a stubborn and major barrier to gender equality. In 2024, UN-Women made significant progress in advancing global knowledge on social norms change, including through developing a framework for addressing discriminatory social norms on gender equality in diverse contexts. Driven by an intersectional, feminist approach emphasizing the role of social institutions \u2013 the state, market, family and community \u2013 in sustaining social norms, the framework will strengthen UN-Women\u2019s work and inform the next Strategic Plan. 39. In 23 countries, UN-Women supported 101 programmes at the community and organizational levels in pursuing three pathways to change discriminatory social norms. 90% >= 90% Progress >= 60% Progress 0-59% Progress Figure 4: Progress towards 2024 milestones UNW/2025/2 25-05955 12/25 40. First, UN-Women facilitated dialogues and reflections within communities and organizations to encourage the questioning of discriminatory norms and the narratives that justify them. In Egypt, Jordan and Morocco, communities, private and public sector organizations were mobilized to challenge discriminatory norms around women\u2019s paid employment and men\u2019s involvement in unpaid care work. 41. Second, UN-Women supported advocacy to end discriminatory norms, strengthening women\u2019s rights movements and allyship, and creating a critical mass demanding change. In the Pacific, UN-Women bolstered coalitions of 13 national and international sports entities to eliminate discriminatory norms. Subsequently, the governing body for rugby in Samoa adopted a \u201czero-violence policy\u201d prohibiting all forms of gender-based discrimination by staff, management, coaches and referees. 42. Third, UN-Women created material conditions for changing discriminatory norms by facilitating legal and organizational policy reforms. As a result, 22 countries developed comprehensive national and subnational strategies to prevent violence against women based on uprooting the discriminatory norms that justify violence. In the United Republic of Tanzania, UN-Women joined other United Nations entities to support the promulgation of the National Clean Cooking Strategy, which recognizes the state\u2019s role in reducing unpaid care work and challenges the normalization of caregiving as women\u2019s responsibility alone. UN-Women continued fostering gender-inclusive workplace cultures in a range of countries. In Georgia, six government agencies rolled out sexual harassment prevention and response policies and mechanisms. In China, UN-Women strengthened the capacities of 10 national, provincial and local partners across diverse industries \u2013 including textiles, apparel and electronics \u2013 to address discriminatory workplace norms. Private sector engagement In 2024, UN-Women made significant strides in engaging with governments and the private sector to promote business environments that work for women. It worked with 11 governments in five regions to strengthen gender-responsive legislation, policies and regulations that uphold private sector accountability, including through the Women\u2019s Empowerment Principles. Strategic partnerships with the private sector resulted in substantial corporate investments in gender equality, with positive impacts on communities. In Nigeria, UN-Women established a $25 million fund to combat gender-based violence with robust support from private companies and international financial institutions. Private sector support to the Women\u2019s Entrepreneurship Expo expanded market access, financing and networks for over 5,000 women entrepreneurs across 20 countries in Europe and Central Asia. A pioneering partnership between UN-Women and the advertising industry through the Unstereotype Alliance aligned 240 organizations with $100.17 billion in global advertising expenditure promoting progressive social norms. Its landmark \u201cinclusion=income\u201d research irrefutably demonstrated that inclusive advertising drives sales and garnered media prominence. UNW/2025/2 13/25 25-05955 H. Outcome 4: Women\u2019s equitable access to services, goods and resources 43. UN-Women deepened investments in women\u2019s equitable access to services, goods and resources essential for livelihoods and well-being, although progress has been mixed. Gender inequalities in land rights demonstrate women\u2019s disparate access to resources, with men\u2019s land ownership at least twice that of women in countries with data. With the support of UN-Women and other partners, the United Republic of Tanzania has dedicated budgets for village land use plans to secure women\u2019s land ownership; 611 certificates on customary rights of occupancy were issued in just one district. 44.",

Member States welcomed the UN80 initiative aimed at building a more effective and efficient United Nations, though delegations stressed that gender equality should remain at the heart of this transformation, and encouraged UN- Women to contribute constructively to an ambitious reform proposal and to help ensure that women\u2019s rights and gender equality are well safeguarded in this reform process. While expressing appreciation and acknowledging the importance of UN- Women\u2019s efforts to advance gender equality and the empowerment of women, one speaker emphasized that support to Member States should be provided with their consent and called on UN-Women to strictly adhere to its mandate and to use intergovernmentally agreed language. III. Evaluation 8. The Director of the Independent Evaluation, Audit and Investigation Services (IEAIS) presented the annual report on the evaluation function of UN-Women (UNW/2025/4). The report provides an overview of the performance of the UN- Women evaluation function in 2024. In total, the Independent Evaluation Service (IES) completed three corporate evaluations in the areas of women's political participation and social norms, a synthesis of United Nations system-wide evaluations related to SDG 5 and a formative assessment of the gender equality accelerators. Additionally, three corporate evaluations were in progress (on ending violence against women, sustainable finance and support to women in peace processes), as well as a synthesis of UN-Women\u2019s performance against the Strategic Plan. Fifty evaluations were conducted or in progress at the decentralized level, including 18 strategic evaluations at the country and regional levels, with six of those portfolio evaluations completed. In 2024, corporate evaluation performance indicators remained rated UNW/2025/6 25-12751 4/22 \u201cgood\u201d; however, financial expenditure on evaluation was 1.6 per cent of the total programme expenditure, falling short of the 2 per cent target. Human resources across UN-Women for evaluation and evaluation implementation rates both increased in 2024. Engagement in joint evaluations also increased, accounting for 35 per cent of all evaluations. In terms of evaluation coverage, all but three country offices had at least one evaluation during their strategic note cycles. The Director of IEAIS reported that implementation of management responses fell slightly to 86 per cent following the introduction of a more rigorous monitoring and tracking system. She added that the use of evaluation remains strong, with 90 per cent of offices reporting the use of evaluation to inform strategic planning, strengthen programme approaches and identify new opportunities. She also outlined the IES\u2019 many partnerships, including its engagement in inter-agency humanitarian evaluations and United Nations system- wide evaluations and initiatives to ensure that evaluations incorporate gender equality. The Director concluded by saying that the IES will continue to conduct corporate strategic evaluations, provide technical assistance to decentralized evaluations and build evaluation partnerships in the United Nations system. 9. The Director of IEAIS presented the corporate evaluation on UN-Women's support to women\u2019s participation in the peace process (UNW/2025/CRP.3). The evaluation concluded that since the adoption of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and Security Council resolution 1325, UN-Women has made meaningful contributions to the inclusion of women in the peace process through five core methods: (1) by convening stakeholders; (2) by raising awareness and supporting political commitments; (3) through supporting civil society; (4) by embedding gender equality in institutional frameworks; and (5) through enhancing partnerships. The evaluation found that politically skilled personnel, senior representatives, presence in country, deep contextual knowledge and enabling corporate procedures are critical drivers to deliver and recommended that UN-Women reinforce these areas. 10. Speaking on behalf of management, the Deputy Executive Director expressed appreciation for the IES\u2019 work, highlighting the benefits that its work brings to UN- Women.",

We acknowledge the mutually reinforcing links between the achievement of gender equality, the empowerment of all women and girls and the eradication of poverty. We emphasize the importance of support for countries in their efforts to eradicate poverty. We recognize the role of social and financial institutions in lifting women and girls out of poverty, and also recognize that countries, who bear the main responsibility for social integration and social inclusion, should invest in care and support systems and, in this regard, we commit to increasing investment in the economy, including the care economy, as well as strengthening social and financial inclusion and economic empowerment. 58. We commit to ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights as agreed in accordance with the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development 19 and the Beijing Platform for Action and the outcome documents of their review conferences. 59. We acknowledge women\u2019s and girls\u2019 critical contributions to their families and communities. We recognize the importance of implementing family-friendly and family-oriented policies aimed at, inter alia, achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls and their enjoyment of all human rights and also recognize the need to ensure that all sustainable development policies and programmes are responsive to the changing needs and expectations of families in fulfilling their numerous functions and that the rights, capabilities and responsibilities of all family members are respected. We also recognize the importance of fully engaging men and boys as agents and beneficiaries of change and as strategic partners and allies in the achievement of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls. 60. We commit to ensuring equal economic participation and leadership to promote and protect women\u2019s rights, foster gender equality, improve the lives and well-being of women, and accelerate achievement of other development outcomes. We will promote women\u2019s access to entrepreneurship, capacity-building, financial inclusion and financial literacy by ensuring access to credit, financial resources and markets, access to ownership and control over land and other forms of property and inheritance, improving social protection systems and public services, addressing unequal distribution of unpaid care and domestic work, and facilitating women\u2019s full and equal participation in the labour market, and equal access of women to decent work and quality jobs in all sectors and at all levels, including through bridging the gender digital divide, digital inclusion and entrepreneurship by promoting, respecting, protecting and fulfilling women\u2019s rights to work and rights at work, including the right to organize and bargain collectively and promoting equal pay for work of equal value. 61.

Global and regional accountability mechanisms, such as the Gender Equality Steering Committee, help to provide guidance to UNICEF country offices on implementation of the Gender Action Plan and ensure adherence to minimum standards. In 2024, some 109 country offices had appropriate management oversight to support gender equality results, and 70 country offices had clearly defined accountability mechanisms within their programme management plans. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, for example, UNICEF has activated a governance mechanism within the country office to oversee programme targets for gender equality and ensure sufficient resourcing of programme priorities and leadership accountability for gender equality across sectors and in the office. IV. The way forward 55. As this report highlights, UNICEF is reaching more girls and women with quality services and opportunities for empowerment than ever before. Strong and lasting partnerships with Governments, civil society and girls are driving progress in education, health and protection, while dedicated resources are being channelled to girls\u2019 and women\u2019s organizations on the front lines of change, particularly in humanitarian settings. Momentum is growing, with national Governments and private, public and philanthropic allies rallying behind programming that advances gender equality and the empowerment of girls and women. 56. Yet much remains to be done. As UNICEF looks ahead to its new Strategic Plan and Gender Action Plan, both for the period 2026\u20132029, it will be critical to preserve and scale up foundational investments in girls\u2019 and women\u2019s empowerment. Key priorities include the following: (a) Expanding health and nutrition initiatives for women and girls, while centring and supporting growing cohorts of female community front-line workers; (b) Scaling up proven solutions for girls\u2019 skills development and transition to meaningful employment, including targeted social protection measures to remove financial barriers to learning; (c) Sustaining UNICEF leadership and strong partnerships for gender equality within the United Nations system, ensuring continued high performance and progress in prioritizing gender equality withing country programmes and financing, and tracking and reporting on impact. E/ICEF/2025/20 17/17 25-07286 57. Systemic change is within reach \u2013 but only with concerted, determined action. At a time when global development assistance is shrinking and threats to the rights of girls and women are mounting, the world needs a clear, unwavering path to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls. UNICEF is committed to doing its part to help to lead that charge as a strong and vibrant partner. Because when girls and women rise, everyone thrives."

      "answer": "UNDP's development priorities for 2025 are shaped by its ongoing Strategic Plan for 2022-2025, which emphasizes several key areas aimed at addressing pressing global challenges and advancing sustainable development. Here are the main priorities:\n\n1. **Climate Action and Sustainability**: UNDP is committed to enhancing climate ambitions and supporting countries in their transition to sustainable practices. This includes initiatives like the Climate Promise 2025 and the Nature Pledge, which aim to mobilize financing for green transitions. By 2025, UNDP aims to help countries scale up their climate ambitions, benefiting nearly 2.2 billion people through integrated support for nature protection and sustainable resource use.\n\n2. **Digital Transformation**: Recognizing the importance of digital technology in development, UNDP is focusing on bridging the global digital divide. By 2025, it aims to enhance digital infrastructure and governance in over 120 countries, ensuring that digital solutions are integrated into development projects. This includes the establishment of the AI Hub for Sustainable Development to foster local AI ecosystems, particularly in Africa.\n\n3. **Gender Equality and Women\u2019s Empowerment**: Gender equality remains a central theme in UNDP's work. The organization aims to direct a significant portion of its resources towards projects that empower women, with targets such as increasing access to essential services and financial resources for women. In 2024, for instance, UNDP reported that 137 million women accessed essential services, and it aims to build on this momentum in 2025.\n\n4. **Addressing Internal Displacement**: As part of its collaboration with the United Nations Steering Group on Solutions to Internal Displacement, UNDP is working with 15 countries to develop nationally owned strategies that address displacement through job creation, housing, and essential services. This initiative is crucial for supporting the 11 million people already impacted.\n\n5. **Financing for Development**: UNDP is focused on increasing flows of public and private finance to support sustainable development, particularly in least developed countries (LDCs) and fragile states. This includes innovative financing mechanisms such as green bonds and strategies to de-risk investments in sustainable projects.\n\n6. **Strengthening Institutional Effectiveness**: UNDP is also prioritizing its internal effectiveness and efficiency, aiming to ensure that a higher percentage of its resources directly support programming. This includes maintaining high standards of accountability and transparency, as evidenced by its consistent top performance in audits and rankings.\n\nThese priorities reflect UNDP's commitment to addressing interconnected global challenges while ensuring that no one is left behind, particularly in vulnerable regions. The organization is positioning itself as a key player in the multilateral system, leveraging partnerships and innovative solutions to achieve its goals by 2025 and beyond.",

Seven countries have already taken steps for 11 million people. DP/2025/12 4 With the future at stake, UNDP demonstrates the power of a connected green agenda 10. Broad UNDP partnerships on climate, nature and energy \u2013 the Climate Promise 2025, Nature Pledge and energy moonshot \u2013 have galvanized global ambition and momentum. In tandem, UNDP has helped to transform financing for the green agenda by connecting countries, based on their priorities, to financing packages that may include green bonds, international environment funds and strategies to derisk energy investment, among others. For example: \u2022 In 80 countries, UNDP is helping to scale up climate ambitions in the third generation of nationally determined contributions, with benefits for nearly 2.2 billion people. \u2022 Between 2022 and 2024, 14.3 million people in 84 countries benefited from integrated support to protect nature and increase the sustainable use of resources. \u2022 In 132 countries since 2022, UNDP has helped nearly 82 million people directly, and 100 million indirectly, to gain access to renewable energy, and linked over 26 million to more productive energy use in health care, water, agriculture, infrastructure and power.1 \u2022 13 countries have raised nearly $21.5 billion for green and sustainable development since 2022, including through bonds, transforming traditional debt instruments into powerful tools for investment in green transitions. UNDP bridges the global digital divide and pursues the promise of responsible artificial intelligence 11. UNDP has been a forerunner in scaling up digital for development while working with partners to mitigate its risks and disparities. Globally, one half of UNDP projects now include a digital component. Comprehensive digital support to 120 countries includes support for over 90 countries on national digital transformation, which is improving governance, services, market access and finance. Recognizing that much of the developing world could miss economic gains from artificial intelligence, UNDP is working with governments on national artificial intelligence assessments. With the Italian Presidency of the Group of Seven, it has launched the AI Hub for Sustainable Development, dedicated to the development of local artificial intelligence ecosystems in Africa. Examples include: \u2022 UNDP digital solutions reached over 200 million people in 2024, attracted more than $1 billion in investments, engaged 500 partners and established or upgraded over 10,000 pieces of digital infrastructure. \u2022 Collaboration with the International Telecommunication Union mobilized $1 billion of new government and private sector investments in connectivity, infrastructure and skills. \u2022 UNDP contributed to the landmark 2024 agreement on global digital cooperation, the Global Digital Compact, and developed a safeguards framework for digital public infrastructure with the Office for Digital and Emerging Technologies.

An official report on the latter will be presented at the annual session. DP/2025/8 9 UNDP segment Interactive dialogue with the UNDP Administrator 56. In his statement, the UNDP Administrator acknowledged the organization\u2019s 60th anniversary and highlighted key development milestones that UNDP has contributed to over its 60 years, including the first Human Development Report, the concept of risk informed development, the role of technology as a development driver, and the approach of addressing emerging and interconnected development challenges in an integrated manner. Throughout, UNDP remained focused on poverty reduction and assisting governments in delivering development more efficiently and effectively. 57. He referred to UNDP as a connector within the development sphere, adding value beyond individual projects. UNDP is locally responsive and embedded within the multilateral system, helping countries chart pathways toward achieving international commitments. The moonshots in the current strategic plan underscored the cumulative impact of UNDP efforts, such as supporting over 800 million people in exercising their right to vote and aligning over $700 billion in public and private finance with the Sustainable Development Goals. 58. He described 2024 as a challenging year. Despite this, UNDP delivered results even in the most complex crises, including conflict, disasters, and the debt crisis that threatens hard earned development gains. He stressed that UNDP, as a development platform, is uniquely positioned to address the intersections between these critical issues. 59. He referred to UNDP as a backbone of the larger United Nations development system, supporting major intergovernmental processes and providing an institutional platform to entities that serve the whole United Nations system, such as the United Nations Volunteers, United Nations Office on South-South Cooperation, Multi-Partner Trust Fund and United Nations Capital Development Fund. UNDP also provides essential support to the United Nations system through common premises, payroll transactions and its new enterprise resource planning system, Quantum. 60. The Administrator highlighted several indicators that demonstrate how UNDP efficiently delivers value, including its top performance across all five categories of the United Nations 2.0 action plan, the 19th clean audit from the United Nations Board of Auditors in 2024, and recognition in AidData\u2019s listening to leaders survey, where UNDP is the only United Nations organization consistently ranked among the top five development partners by leaders receiving its advice or assistance. He highlighted that the achievements of UNDP are largely the result of strategic investments made possible through its core resources. The ability to multiply every dollar of its core funding eightfold has enabled UNDP to mobilize additional resources for critical development issues, expanding its reach beyond traditional bilateral aid.",

Least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing States (SIDS), and conflict-affected and fragile countries stand at a pivotal moment. They are brimming with potential yet beset by persistent challenges that hold back progress on the Sustainable Development Goals. Not least among these is the need to drive increased funding to areas most in need. Having long been seen as high-risk by the traditional financial architecture, these regions and countries have been underserved and lack the resources required to build inclusive economies and adapt to a changing climate. 2. Extreme poverty levels remain significantly high. Coupled with debt-to-gross domestic product (GDP) levels at their highest point in decades, rising food prices have increased food insecurity, instability and the risk of hunger. Less than half the population in LDCs have access to basic sanitation and some 500 million people still lack access to electricity.1 More than 231 million people in LDCs were expected to require humanitarian assistance in 2024, compared with 190 million in 2022.2 3. Making progress on the Sustainable Development Goals in these countries and achieving our collective goal of leaving no one behind will require additional support to strengthen productive capacities, develop and diversify inclusive economies and provide affordable access to adequate financial resources. Despite a record $287 billion in global official development assistance (ODA) in 2022, aid to LDCs fell by 4 per cent to $62 billion,3 following an 8 per cent decrease the previous year, while aid to SIDS fell by 13 per cent to $5.9 billion.",

Additionally, the Administrator emphasized UNDP\u2019s continued role in hosting and providing core funding to system-wide entities, including the United Nations Volunteers (UNV) programme, the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF), and the United Nations Office for South-South Cooperation (UNOSSC). 63. The Administrator pointed to institutional performance gains, such as 19 consecutive unqualified audit opinions and consistent top rankings in the Aid Transparency Index. He reported increased programme efficiency, with 92 cents of every dollar now going directly to programming- up from 88 cents- and cited improved implementation of the United Nations System-Wide Action Plan on Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-SWAP) as indicators of disciplined, accountable institutional management. 64. Expressing concern over declining core resources, the Administrator cautioned that core funding could fall to below $450 million by 2026\u2014less than half the level recorded in the early 2010s. He described this trajectory as unsustainable, warning that it could undermine programme delivery, staffing, institutional resilience, and the integrity of UNDP systems. He urged Member States to consider the long-term implications of continued declines in core funding. 65. Looking forward, the Administrator introduced the draft Strategic Plan, 2026\u20132029, as a focused and integrated document shaped by consultations with over 11,000 stakeholders. He DP/2025/20 25-11430 11 reaffirmed the centrality of human development, emphasized systemic transformation, and highlighted strengthened risk management. The Plan draws on lessons from the past eight years to deliver results and impact in increasingly complex environments. 66. During the interactive dialogue, delegations expressed appreciation for the leadership of the Administrator and welcomed the cumulative review of the UNDP Strategic Plan, 2022-2025, and the Administrator\u2019s annual report for 2024. Delegations commended UNDP\u2019s performance and its role in the multilateral system during a challenging period. 67. Several delegations and regional groups expressed strong appreciation for the Administrator\u2019s leadership, acknowledging his efforts to reposition UNDP as an agile, forward-looking organization. They highlighted UNDP\u2019s contributions to development finance, innovation, climate action, support to elections and crises, and United Nations development system coherence. The Administrator was commended for efforts to improve organizational transparency, efficiency, and gender equality. 68. A number of delegations stressed the importance of predictable, flexible core resources. They noted the urgent need to reverse declining core funding trends, which could undermine programmatic delivery and continuity. Other delegations and regional groups emphasized the disproportionate impact of these trends on least developed countries, Small Island Developing States (SIDS), and countries in crisis or transition. Delegations reiterated their support for multilateralism and pledged continued collaboration with UNDP in implementing the Pact for the Future and strengthening coherence across the United Nations system. 69. On strategic planning, delegations welcomed the cumulative review and commended UNDP for maintaining focus on results. They urged the organization to maintain its emphasis on national ownership, country-level delivery, and alignment with national priorities. Delegations stressed the need for greater attention to countries in special situations, including middle-income countries, SIDS, and those affected by conflict. There was also strong support for South-South and triangular cooperation. 70. Member States broadly welcomed the draft Strategic Plan, 2026\u20132029, recognizing its ambition and responsiveness to current and emerging challenges. They emphasized the importance of maintaining a strategic focus on poverty eradication, gender equality, and leaving no one behind, while also underscoring the need for clear prioritization, adaptability in the face of funding constraints, and a well-defined articulation of UNDP\u2019s comparative advantage. 71. Member States emphasized the importance of innovation and digitalization, urging UNDP to deepen investments in digital public infrastructure, data systems, and technological innovations to accelerate the SDGs. Delegations requested more information on how UNDP integrates lessons learned into its programming and welcomed efforts to track performance through robust monitoring frameworks. 72.",

In 2024, progress towards the 2030 Agenda remained off track. Only 17 per cent of the Goals targets are on track; nearly half are showing minimal or moderate progress; and progress on over one third has stalled or regressed.3 Climate change affects those most vulnerable 5. Global greenhouse gas emissions set a new record in 2023.4People living in situations of fragility, conflict and violence are especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change. It is estimated that, by 2030, nearly 60 per cent of the world\u2019s extreme poor will live in fragile countries affected by conflict and violence.5 The global economy exacerbates inequalities 6. The global economic outlook improved in 2024, but was marked by uncertainty and uneven distribution.6 The annual financing gap for developing countries reached about $4 trillion.7 Pact for the future to accelerate implementation of the 2030 Agenda 7. In September 2024, heads and state of government committed to 56 actions to ensure the future we want and to effectively respond to current and future challenges, in partnership with all relevant stakeholders8. The repositioned development system 8. Through the quadrennial comprehensive policy review, the General Assembly establishes key system-wide strategic policy orientations and operational modalities for the development cooperation and country-level modalities of the United Nations development system. 9. The 2024 review reiterated the call on the United Nations development system to seek comparative advantages based on mandates, and to mainstream key decisions into their strategic plans. These include mainstreaming the Sustainable Development Goals, disability inclusion, climate- and environment-responsive approaches, the Doha Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries (resolution 76/258), the Antigua and Barbuda agenda for small island developing States (resolution 78/317), the Gaborone programme of action for landlocked developing countries for the decade 2024-2034 (resolution 79/233), South-South and triangular cooperation, and the special needs of middle-income countries.9 1 Decision 2022/13 2 Decisions 2021/20 and 2023/16 3 Sustainable Development Goals Report, 2024 4 UNEP Emissions Gap Report, 2024 5 Fragility, Conflict and Violence 6 World Economic Situation and Prospects as of mid-2024 7 Financing for Sustainable Development Report, 2024 8 Summit of the Future outcome document 9 A/C.2/79/L.60 DP/OPS/2025/6 5 III. Ambition for impact A. Contributing to impact through projects while harnessing capacity for missions 10. In 2024, UNOPS implemented more than 1,100 projects across over 130 countries10 for a value of about $2.7 billion: 83 per cent for development activities, 11 per cent humanitarian, and 6 per cent peace and security. 11. UNOPS assigns projects to the main Goal to which they are expected to contribute. In 2024, two Goals accounted for about half of UNOPS activities: Goal 3, \u2018good health and well-being\u2019 (37 per cent); and Goal 16, \u2018peace, justice and strong institutions\u2019 (14 per cent). 12. In 2023, the UNOPS Executive Director initiated a process to harness knowledge and capacity through eight missions. These are internal communities and networks intended to foster collaboration; they are not an expression of external programmatic intent. 13. The missions can be summarized in three groups. The following paragraphs illustrate the challenges and examples of the solutions UNOPS has implemented. Accelerate sustainable development 14. Triple planetary crisis. The crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution is an existential threat. Currently 3.6 billion people live in areas highly susceptible to climate change, and 21.5 million are displaced each year by climate-change related disasters. 15. Energy transition. By 2030, an estimated 660 million people will lack electricity access and around 1.8 billion will go without clean cooking fuels and technologies. (The energy sector is responsible for 73 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions.) 16. Just digital transformation. Approximately 2.6 billion people remain off-line, and only 50 per cent of the rural population use the internet (compared to 81 per cent of the urban population). 17. Food system transformation. An estimated 28.9 percent of the global population \u2013 2.33 billion people \u2013 were moderately or severely food insecure in 2023. Practical solutions accelerating sustainable development.

      "question": "What does the Joint Inspection Unit recommend for UN efficiency?",
      "answer": "The Joint Inspection Unit (JIU) has made several recommendations aimed at enhancing efficiency within the United Nations system, particularly focusing on the governance and oversight functions of various UN entities. Here are some key insights based on the recent reports:\n\n1. **Implementation of Recommendations**: The JIU emphasizes the importance of following up on its recommendations to improve management and administrative efficiency. For instance, UNEP has shown an improved rate of implementation of JIU recommendations, indicating a positive trend towards better governance and oversight practices [1].\n\n2. **Streamlining Governance**: The JIU has called for a review of the governance and oversight functions of the Executive Boards of UNDP, UNFPA, UNOPS, UNICEF, and UN-Women. This includes the establishment of a working group to assess how these boards execute their functions and to ensure that they are fit for purpose in the context of evolving multilateralism [2][4]. The working group is tasked with mapping and categorizing JIU recommendations, identifying areas for early action, and preparing thematic clusters for focused discussions.\n\n3. **Enhancing Coordination**: The JIU highlights the need for better coordination among UN entities to maximize efficiency. This includes fostering trust-based collaboration and ensuring that governance structures are aligned with the operational realities of the UN system [4]. For example, UN-Women is encouraged to strengthen its assurance activities and improve its resource allocation methodologies to enhance operational effectiveness [2].\n\n4. **Focus on Ethics and Accountability**: The JIU also underscores the significance of ethics and accountability as foundational elements for trust within the organization. Recommendations include enhancing the independence and resources of the ethics function, which is crucial for fostering a culture of safety and openness [3]. \n\n5. **Cost Efficiency Measures**: In the context of operational support, the JIU has pointed out potential areas for cost reductions, such as reviewing the management of contingent-owned equipment and optimizing the use of military aviation assets [5]. This reflects a broader push for financial prudence and operational efficiency across UN missions.\n\nOverall, the JIU's recommendations are geared towards creating a more efficient, accountable, and responsive UN system, emphasizing the need for continuous improvement in governance, resource management, and ethical standards. These efforts are essential for the UN to effectively meet its mandates and adapt to changing global circumstances. \n\nIf you have any specific areas of interest regarding the JIU's recommendations or their implementation, feel free to ask!",

Between 2020 and 2024, OIOS conducted between one and three internal audits each year focusing on UNEP, which were selected through its risk- based approach. The audits examined management topics (delegation of authority, procurement, recruitment and subprogrammes) or focused on a specific organizational unit (headquarters divisions or regional offices). In addition, as presented in table 17, during the same period OIOS audited five secretariats of multilateral environmental agreements in relation to financial and administrative matters.

OIOS investigations. UNEP maintains a record of all allegations of prohibited conduct in the Case Management Tracking System of the United Nations Secretariat. On the basis of the information available in OIOS annual reports issued between 2020 and 2024, investigations related to fraud and misconduct allegations varied between two and five per year, as shown in table 18. In the past two years, most investigations JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 25-10420 63 were related to possible fraudulent practices. The research showed that most staff members know how to report prohibited conduct cases, but affiliate personnel less so. Both categories of the workforce have limited trust in how the reported cases are followed up and managed. To mitigate this perception, further measures could be taken to build the confidence of personnel towards reporting prohibited conduct cases to make sure that they are not overlooked or not reported on. Additionally, as UNEP is engaged with numerous implementing partners, the Inspector recalls the importance of having robust investigation clauses and provisions included in this type of partnership agreement.97 Table 18 Overview of investigations by the Office of Internal Oversight Services (period reported on July year n \u2013 June year n+1) 2020/21 2021/22 2022/23 2023/24 2 investigation reports 5 investigation reports and 1 investigation closure notice 2 investigation reports, 4 investigation closure notices and 1 investigation advisory report 5 investigation reports and 2 investigation closure notices Source: Prepared by JIU on the basis of OIOS annual reports (2025). 125. OIOS evaluations. As initiated by the Committee for Programme and Coordination,98 OIOS conducts an evaluation of UNEP every six years and follow-up triennial reviews of the implementation of recommendations contained therein. The Inspector consulted these reports and found them well-elaborated and providing useful indications on the relevance and the effectiveness of the organization, including its institutional arrangements and its management policies and practices. 99 Following the latest triennial review, the Inspector is pleased to acknowledge that the five recommendations are considered implemented by OIOS. Furthermore, UNEP is also scrutinized by OIOS when it undertakes evaluations of broader subjects within the purview of the United Nations Secretariat. 126. Joint Inspection Unit. The system for following up on JIU reports and recommendations, adopted by the General Assembly in 1999, applies to UNEP as a participating organization. Even if the practice has been erratic for many years, as described in a JIU report issued in 2024 on the consideration of and action taken on its reports and recommendations by United Nations system organizations, 100 the Inspector acknowledges that, following recent initiatives, UNEP has recorded an improved rate of implementation of JIU recommendations issued up to 2023. UNEP management communicated that a new review-specific procedure providing Member States with information on oversight recommendations, including those formulated by JIU, had been implemented since 2024.",

A joint statement delivered on behalf of a group of countries welcomed the thirteenth consecutive unqualified audit opinion and thanked the UN Board of Auditors for their report. The joint statement recognized UN-Women\u2019s efforts to implement the recommendations of the UN Board of Auditors, highlighting its 92 per cent implementation rate. The group of countries further noted areas of improvement identified by the report, including the allocation of core resources, and encouraged UN-Women to adhere to the Board of Auditor\u2019s recommendations in this regard. In addition, the group of countries encouraged UN-Women to strengthen its assurance activities life cycle by implementing an alert system. The joint statement urged UN-Women to perform monthly reconciliations with UNDP through the interfund cash clearing account to ensure timely payments are made by UNDP on behalf of UN-Women. Furthermore, UN-Women was encouraged to adhere to the recommendations to strengthen the support it gives to country offices to enable them to implement concrete actions that contribute to environmental sustainability. 17. In response, the Deputy Executive Director for Resource Management, Sustainability and Partnerships noted the progress made by UN-Women, highlighting the relative size and maturity of the Entity. The Deputy Executive Director went on to state that UN-Women is prepared to update its core resource allocation methodology ahead of the Executive Board\u2019s annual session 2026. She added that UN-Women is also working on the new integrated budget and internal core resource allocation tool in conjunction with updating its methodology. The Deputy stressed the importance of identifying priorities and opportunities through consultative processes while maintaining flexibility for allocating global funds at the regional level. The Director of the Strategy, Planning, Resources and Effectiveness Division confirmed that UN-Women is on track to update its core resource allocation methodology through reviewing its core resource allocation tool. The Director noted that the Entity is embedding procedures on social and environmental sustainability by building the capacities of staff at all levels through enhanced socialization. This will help personnel understand how to meet social and environmental requirements as part of a holistic approach to performance and planning. The Director of the Management and Administration Division ad interim concluded by stating that for the interfund cash clearing account, UN- Women and UNDP have made significant improvements to the reconciliation payment process and that UN-Women will continue to work with UNDP to further reduce discrepancies and maximize efficiencies in this matter. V. Joint Inspection Unit review of governance and oversight of the Executive Boards of UNDP/UNFPA/UNOPS, UNICEF and UN-Women 18. The President of the Executive Board representing the Western European and Others Group provided an update on the implementation of the assessment of how the Executive Board executes its governance and oversight functions following the Joint Inspection Unit (JIU) report JIU/REP/2023/7 and as mandated by Executive Board Decision 2024/3. She noted that in November UNW/2025/1 7/20 2024, the Bureau of UN-Women\u2019s Executive Board received preliminary comments from the Entity\u2019s management and independent offices on the JIU report which have since been posted online. The President shared that a working group comprised of 15 Member States with cross-board and equal regional representation was approved through a silent agreement procedure on 24 January 2025. She noted that the UN-Women Bureau collaborated with the Bureaux of UNDP/UNFPA/UNOPS and UNICEF to draft the terms of reference for the working group which have been approved by the other Executive Boards during their first regular sessions, and she expressed the hope that the Board of UN-Women would do likewise. The President underscored the importance of this process in ensuring the effectiveness and governance of the Board and the role it has in helping UN-Women deliver on its mandate, while urging Member States to remain committed in advancing shared goals in this regard. 19. After the floor was opened, a group of Member States emphasized the importance of the JIU review for enhancing the governance and oversight of the Executive Boards, with the objective of maximizing the ability of United Nations entities to deliver. The joint statement went on to recognize the importance of making use of lessons learned to make the Executive Boards fit for purpose in the context of changing circumstances regarding the role of multilateralism.",

He highlighted the 85 per cent increase in service requests as a positive indicator of growing trust in the ethics function. The Chief of Staff expressed deep appreciation to the ethics team for their steadfast contributions, and acknowledged the critical updates to the Protection against Retaliation Policy as tangible safeguards that reinforce a culture of safety and openness. He added that UN-Women welcomed the expanded learning and outreach effort in collaboration with UNDP, underscoring the importance of system-wide coherence and shared principles. On UN-Women\u2019s full compliance with the Financial Disclosure Programme, the Chief of Staff noted it as essential to maintaining public trust and managing conflicts of interest. He also stressed that UN-Women underscores the importance of enabling staff to raise concerns and praised the ethics function for its guidance. He further reiterated that UN-Women remains firmly committed to ensuring that the ethics function is fully independent and adequately resourced. Noting the current financial constraints, the Chief of Staff shared that, in line with the UN80 principles of streamlining and coherence, UN-Women is exploring establishing a shared service model for the ethics function with other agencies to enhance efficiency and coherence. He concluded by thanking the Ethics Advisor for her outstanding service. 20. After opening the floor, one delegation requested to know more about the shared ethics service that was proposed by the Entity and what the timeline for its creation will be. The delegation also wanted to know whether any current gaps that exist in the ethics model will be bridged with the creation of the potential new joint model. A separate delegation thanked the ethics function for their diligent work in helping to foster cultural change and encouraged the Entity to increase participation in mandatory ethics trainings, and to finalize key polices under review, such as the policy on gifts and hospitality. 21. Responding to Member States\u2019 interventions, the Ethics Advisor confirmed that the function is finalizing some of the key policies, including the policy on gifts and UNW/2025/6 9/22 25-12751 hospitality. She shared that an online system is being developed for personnel to streamline requests for how to dispose of gifts. In addition, she shared that there was an increase in the completion of mandatory ethics trainings in 2024, and that training certification is required before personnel can request outside activities review and approval. The Chief of Staff also responded to Member States comments by stating that the Executive Board will receive an update on the shared ethics function at the second regular session of 2025, and assured that there will be no gaps between the current function and the planned shared function. VI. Review of governance and oversight of the Executive Boards of the United Nations Development Programme/United Nations Population Fund/ United Nations Office for Project Services, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund and UN-Women 22. A representative speaking on behalf of the Joint Inspection Unit (JIU) working group provided the Executive Board with an update on the progress of the group in implementing recommendations of the JIU in accordance with decisions 2024/3 and 2025/2. The speaker presented the working methods and road map of the group, developed in the Terms of Reference approved earlier in the year. The speaker added that the JIU working group will form thematic subgroups to effectively cluster recommendations. The speaker shared that there was agreement in the group to take a case-by-case approach, ensuring that decision-making is better aligned and meaningful. 23. One delegation speaking on behalf of 33 Member States welcomed the update by the JIU working group and noted that a key objective of the review must be to streamline Executive Board proceedings to facilitate more strategic deliberations and timely decision-making. The group also noted that this process should be supported by relevant actors within the organizations, units responsible for governance and oversight, or the secretariats. The group added that a mapping exercise would be useful to establish harmonized Terms of Reference of the Board secretariats. They concluded by stating that the process should take into account parallel reform efforts such as UN80. 24. The representative of the JIU working group responded to Member States\u2019 interventions by reaffirming the group\u2019s commitment to transparent and results- driven processes.",

He reported that UNFPA had issued MAF guidance, conducted surveys to identify implementation challenges, and incorporated dual reporting into performance appraisal processes. Country programme documents are fully aligned with UNSDCFs, and Resident Coordinator confirmation letters are routinely submitted. UNFPA reiterated its strong commitment to the Resident Coordinator system, to timely cost-sharing contributions, and to performance transparency through the use of established reform indicators. 47. The UNOPS Deputy Executive Director (Delivery and Partnerships) outlined the organization\u2019s contributions to the efficiency agenda. She highlighted United Nations Web Buy Plus and human resources services as key global shared services provided by UNOPS to other United Nations entities. UNOPS also actively participates in the common back-office initiative, citing its partnership with UNICEF in Pakistan with a view to becoming a lead service provider. On the MAF, she welcomed efforts to streamline guidance and reaffirmed UNOPS support for the Resident Coordinator system and dual reporting, emphasizing the value of mutual feedback between Resident Coordinators and entity representatives. In 2024, UNOPS participated in 94 UNSDCFs and supported 13 common country analyses. In addition to the current indicators in the reform checklist, UNOPS is developing a set of results and performance indicators to inform its next Strategic Plan. She emphasized the importance of sharpening system-wide metrics to incentivize performance and enhancing collective communication to demonstrate the impact of reform. 48. The Executive Board adopted decision 2025/8 on the update on implementation efforts on the repositioning of the United Nations development system. DP/2025/20 25-11430 9 VII. Update on the assessment of how the Executive Board executes its governance and oversight functions 49. The Executive Board received an update from the Co-Chair of the Joint Working Group of the Executive Boards of UNDP/UNFPA/UNOPS, UNICEF, and UN-Women on the governance and oversight functions of the Executive Boards and to examine the recommendations of the JIU report entitled Review of the governance and oversight functions of the Executive Boards of the UNDP, UNFPA, UNOPS, UNICEF and UN-Women (JIU/REP/2023/7). 50. The Co-Chair of the Joint Working Group provided an update on the progress of the group\u2019s work to assess and advance the recommendations of the JIU report. He recalled the group\u2019s establishment following the 2024 annual session and expressed appreciation to the 15 Member State representatives for their active engagement and collaborative spirit. The Co-Chair emphasized that the swift adoption of the group\u2019s term of reference and working methods- based on inclusivity, structure, and consensus- demonstrated strong commitment to strengthening governance and oversight across the four Boards. 51. The Co-Chair outlined the roadmap guiding the group\u2019s work, organized into four phases: (i) mapping and categorizing the JIU recommendations; (ii) identifying areas for early action; (iii) conducting in-depth review of more complex or structural issues; and (iv) preparing thematic clusters with supporting sub-groups to enable focused discussion. He noted that the group had already consulted with the JIU to revisit the recommendations in light of evolving financial and institutional contexts and underscored the importance of building early momentum while recognizing that it was premature to present \u201cquick wins\u201d at this stage. Nonetheless, the group saw value in identifying non-contentious, actionable items to build trust and demonstrate early progress. 52. Looking ahead, the Co-Chair confirmed that the next meeting of the Joint Working Group was scheduled for mid-July, where substantive discussions would begin. While the Terms of Reference anticipated decision points at each Board session, the group agreed that a case-by-case approach to decision-making would ensure relevance and alignment with the group\u2019s pace of work. Regular updates will be provided to maintain transparency. The Co-Chair concluded by reaffirming the time-bound nature of the mandate, the group\u2019s commitment to an agile and Member State-driven process, and its openness to supporting broader reform efforts through governance insights that may emerge over the course of its work. 53. A group of delegations welcomed the update, commended the collaborative spirit and early achievements of the Joint Working Group, and reiterated their support. They emphasized the importance of streamlining Board operations, strengthening accountability, and maintaining a transparent and results-oriented approach.",
        "tify additional savings in future years in a phased manner. There are areas where AUSSOM could find more efficiencies, including in contingent-owned equipment (major equipment) and self-sustainment. The upcoming review of the statement of unit requirements, as part of the reconfiguration of AUSSOM, could be helpful in that regard. A comparative analysis may also be needed to determine whether it would be more economical for troop- and police-contributing countries to provide additional categories of self-sustainment7 or for UNSOS to continue providing such support. In addition, there appears to be underutilization of military aviation assets in the mission, especially in the light of the lack of cross-sector air support, even when provided for in the concept of operations. A deeper analysis of actual usage of existing military aircraft may also present opportunities for cost reductions. Moreover, there are cost avoidance opportunities in the management of contingent-owned equipment beyond economic repair that should be destroyed in-country rather than repatriated at great cost. 30. As noted, AUSSOM and UNSOS can work together in various areas to find more efficiencies. The reconfiguration of AUSSOM could potentially yield savings if careful consideration is given to the most efficient and effective configuration of the mission\u2019s aviation fleet and the new layout of its bases. With such changes, it might be possible to find efficiencies in the resupply of life support to the bases, but it would take time to implement them. 31. Lastly, there are various areas in which UNSOS can strive to find more efficiency gains, by reviewing the manner in which it executes some aspects of its support package. Some potential areas to reassess are the mine action delivery model, which still relies predominantly on the United Nations Office for Project Services, and greater use of local procurement, in particular for delivery of supplies to the Somali security forces. __________________ 7 The Security Council, in its resolution 2010 (2011), decided, on an exceptional basis and owing to the unique character of the African Union Mission in Somalia, to extend logistical support to cover augmentation of some limited areas of self-sustainment, including catering equipment and training, communications equipment, sanitary and cleaning materials, furniture and stationery. A/79/907 S/2025/268 25-06872 10/24 Recommendations 32. The overall cost reduction of $61.6 million identified represents the balance between current UNSOS support for AUSSOM and the acceptable risk levels to its operations. Without additional budget assessments, this amount, as stated above (see para. 28), is insufficient to fully meet the $132.1 million needed from the assessed budget for troop reimbursements in the 2025/26 budget period at the mission specific rate of $1,000 proposed in the joint report. Moreover, the overall identified cost reduction will not be fully available on 1 July 2025 and will need to be phased over the course of the 2025/26 budget year. Furthermore, contributions from the African Union will be important to securing the $44.1 million that is to be mobilized as extra- budgetary resources. 33. On the operational support front, implementation of reduced support and costs would need to be phased, both to ensure mitigation measures are put in place and also to allow the necessary time to amend and terminate contracts. On the staffing front, while UNSOS can reduce positions that present a low or medium risk for its operational support to AUSSOM, a more thorough review should be done by UNSOS to ensure that an in-depth analysis is undertaken to guide reductions in staffing levels. In view of the light footprint of UNSOS, additional support in operational workforce planning can be sought from Headquarters in order to review and align staffing and structures with priorities and the concept of operations. Doing so is important because the staffing level and composition of UNSOS had been specifically configured to provide effective support to the successive African Union missions and the Support Office\u2019s concept of operations. Furthermore, the staffing reduction may have to be implemented in the light of the delayed reconfiguration of ATMIS to AUSSOM, as it entails several activity-intense components, including the reorientation and realignment of all troops (both African Union and Somalia security forces) to the new mission disposition, which itself entails the closing and handing over of forward and tactical operating bases. This reconfiguration will also include the repatriation of existing troops and equipment and the deployment of new troops and equipment."

      "question": "How do General Assembly reports address climate change?",
      "answer": "The General Assembly's reports address climate change through a multifaceted approach, emphasizing the urgency of the issue and the need for comprehensive action. For instance, in the draft ministerial declaration from the high-level segment of the Economic and Social Council, climate change is highlighted as one of the greatest challenges of our time. The report expresses alarm over the rising emissions of greenhouse gases and underscores the vulnerability of developing countries to climate impacts. It calls for immediate and urgent priorities in both mitigation and adaptation efforts to address these challenges effectively [2].\n\nMoreover, the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) emphasizes the integration of climate action into urban planning and disaster risk reduction. It recognizes the role of local authorities in achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and stresses the importance of resilient infrastructure to withstand climate impacts [3]. This reflects a broader trend in General Assembly discussions, where climate change is often linked to sustainable development, disaster risk management, and the need for international cooperation.\n\nAdditionally, the Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) has also reiterated the importance of climate action and resilient infrastructure, calling for enhanced cooperation and the development of impactful solutions that align with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development [4]. This interconnectedness of climate action with various sectors and goals illustrates the comprehensive nature of the General Assembly's approach to addressing climate change.\n\nIn summary, General Assembly reports not only recognize climate change as a critical global issue but also advocate for integrated strategies that involve multiple stakeholders and sectors to foster resilience and sustainable development. This holistic perspective is essential for addressing the complex challenges posed by climate change effectively.",

The Inspector regrets that the participation in these surveys was insufficient to inform the analysis. This appears to be a persistent challenge also faced by UNEP management in previous surveys of representatives of Member States (for example those conducted in the context of the programme performance reports for 2022 and 2023); (f) Views of other stakeholders. The Inspector interviewed panels of experts from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the Green Climate Fund (GCF), which are the main sources of global (vertical) funds for UNEP. 10. Finalization of the report. In accordance with article 11 (2) of the statute of the Joint Inspection Unit and for quality assurance purposes, the draft report was subjected to an internal peer review to obtain comments from JIU Inspectors and to test the recommendations against the collective wisdom of the Unit. The revised report was circulated to UNEP management to correct any factual errors and provide comments on the findings, conclusions and recommendations. All types of contributions were processed with due respect for the confidentiality standards applied by JIU. The report was finalized taking into consideration all the comments received, although the final responsibility for the review rests solely with the author. 11. Recommendations. The present report is directed to UNEP executive management as well as the members of the United Nations Environment Assembly JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 25-10420 5 and the Committee of Permanent Representatives. As presented also in the concise report, the review contains eight formal recommendations, of which three are addressed to the governing bodies and five to the Executive Director. These recommendations are complemented by 27 informal recommendations (of which 18 are also found in the concise report) appearing in bold in the narrative and providing additional suggestions for reinforcing the management framework and related practices at UNEP. II. Governance framework A. Governance 12. Multi-tiered governance. The governance of the Programme must be viewed in the broader context of the United Nations system, as presented in figure II, which shows the various frameworks relevant to the organization. In addition to its own multi-tiered governance structure, as a United Nations programme, UNEP reports to the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council and to their respective subsidiary bodies for administrative and budgetary matters (the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions) and programme planning (the Committee for Programme and Coordination). The overall environmental governance framework of the system also includes the governing bodies of the multilateral environmental agreements to which UNEP provides secretariat support.

Environment Assembly. In 2012, the General Assembly, in paragraph 4 (b) of its resolution 67/213, granted universal membership to the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme and changed its designation to the \u201cUnited Nations Environment Assembly of the United Nations Environment Programme\u201d. The Environment Assembly is considered the world\u2019s highest-level decision-making body for matters related to the environment and reports to the General Assembly. It held its first session in 2014 and meets biennially for a one-week session to set the global environmental agenda, undertake policy review and provide overarching policy guidance, set the strategic guidance on the future direction of the Programme and define policy responses to address emerging environmental challenges. The Inspector intended to assess whether this expansion of the membership had contributed to enhancing the governance process of the organization, but no conclusions were reached due to the insufficient participation of key stakeholders in the JIU online surveys. Participation in the Environment Assembly primarily gathers representatives from ministries of environment, major groups and stakeholders (such as civil society and private sector representatives), other international organizations and scientists from across the globe. A good practice identified by the Inspector is the definition of indicators linked to policymaking organs in UNEP strategic planning documents, referring to the activities of the Environment Assembly.",

      "question": "What does ECOSOC say about post-pandemic recovery?",
      "answer": "The Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) has emphasized the importance of a comprehensive approach to post-pandemic recovery, particularly in the context of addressing the multifaceted challenges that have emerged due to COVID-19. Here are some key points derived from the recent documents:\n\n1. **Integrated Recovery Strategies**: ECOSOC highlights the need for integrated policies that address the humanitarian-development-peace nexus. This means that recovery efforts should not only focus on immediate humanitarian needs but also on long-term development goals and peacebuilding efforts. The aim is to create resilience against future crises by addressing underlying vulnerabilities and promoting sustainable development [3].\n\n2. **Mental Health and Well-being**: The draft ministerial declaration for the high-level segment of the 2025 session underscores the importance of mental health in the recovery process. It calls for comprehensive strategies for the prevention, early diagnosis, management, and treatment of mental health conditions, particularly in the wake of the pandemic. This focus is crucial as mental health issues have been exacerbated by the pandemic, affecting individuals' ability to contribute to recovery efforts [4].\n\n3. **Food Security and Nutrition**: ECOSOC expresses deep concern about food insecurity and malnutrition, which have been significant issues during the pandemic. The Council reaffirms its commitment to ending hunger and malnutrition by 2030, recognizing that food security is critical for promoting healthier populations and achieving sustainable development. This is particularly relevant as the pandemic has disrupted food systems globally [4].\n\n4. **Support for Vulnerable Populations**: The need to support developing countries and vulnerable populations is a recurring theme. ECOSOC emphasizes that recovery strategies must prioritize those who are furthest behind, ensuring equitable access to resources and opportunities. This includes addressing the specific challenges faced by countries that have been less able to benefit from international support measures [5].\n\n5. **Strengthening Multilateralism**: The Council also calls for a reaffirmation of multilateralism as a means to effectively address the challenges posed by the pandemic and other global crises. It stresses that a strong multilateral system is essential for ensuring that all countries have a voice and can participate in shaping recovery efforts [5].\n\nIn summary, ECOSOC's perspective on post-pandemic recovery is multifaceted, focusing on integrated approaches that encompass mental health, food security, support for vulnerable populations, and the reinforcement of multilateral cooperation. These elements are crucial for building resilience and ensuring that recovery efforts are sustainable and inclusive. If you have specific areas of interest within this topic, feel free to ask!",

        "building institutional capacity, enhancing resilience and facilitating the clean energy transition in developing countries most vulnerable to extreme heat. Subnational governments required particular support in implementing context-specific adaptation measures. E/2025/44 E/C.16/2025/9 25-06882 23/26 Reform of climate finance mechanisms and the establishment of a global heat task force could help in coordinating and accelerating action. 62. Governments, banks, institutional investors and other actors needed to develop partnerships that made it easier to finance renewable energy investments. Governments could assist directly by lowering regulatory barriers, providing concessionary funds, explaining benefits to the public and otherwise incentivizing investment in renewables. Enhancing coordination and collaboration 63. The Committee agreed that global frameworks and multilateral partnerships should be leveraged to promote international collaboration and share best practices and resources, thus enhancing collective resilience and responding to disparate mandates across institutions. 64. Given the interconnected nature of the impacts of extreme heat across sectors, cross-sectoral coordination was crucial, leading to coherent and sustainable solutions and facilitating national resilience-building. In many cases, it was important to link all those policy elements through a coordinated approach under the broader umbrella of climate action while also understanding accountability framework requirements for effective oversight. 65. Governments should be encouraged to adopt participatory approaches to engage local communities and other actors to ensure that energy transition and extreme heat strategies reflected local needs and built resilience. Public-private partnerships could be effective in driving innovation and promoting investment in sustainable solutions aimed at combating extreme heat, if properly managed. 66. Robust data and monitoring systems were indispensable tools for managing the impacts of extreme heat. Collected data from diverse sources could be used for public alerts, early warning systems, community response plans, health surveillance and climate change research. F. Governance of mental health to leave no one behind in post-conflict countries 67. The Committee noted with concern that more than 1 in 5 people in conflict- affected settings experienced some form of psychological distress or mental health condition at some point in time, with almost 1 in 10 having a moderate or severe diagnosis. That was particularly alarming given the rising number of armed conflicts worldwide and the impact that mental health conditions had on effective governance for sustainable development, the delivery of public services and, more generally, on prospects for long-term recovery in post-conflict countries. In addition, mental health conditions had consequences for public sector workers, who might be suffering from post-traumatic stress that affected their basic functioning and the services they provided. 68. Building strong institutions at all levels and accelerating progress towards the Goals necessitated greater attention to the treatment of mental health in post-conflict settings, as those conditions could worsen over time if left unattended and further undermine development outcomes. Referring to World Health Assembly resolution 77.3 on strengthening mental health and psychosocial support before, during and after armed conflicts, natural and human-caused disasters and health and other emergencies, the Committee underscored that an increased focus on the management of mental health systems and leadership was required, in addition to the building of strong and resilient institutions that could support the delivery of community-based E/2025/44 E/C.16/2025/9 24/26 25-06882 solutions over the long term. A World Health Organization report on building back better contained practical examples of how better-quality and more sustainable mental health systems had been built in many emergency-affected areas despite challenging circumstances. 69. Given the significant implications for governance and institution-building, the Committee was of the view that approaches to mental health and psychosocial support needed to become structural elements of peacebuilding efforts. It was also critical to address the mental health and social needs of post-conflict populations in order to prevent future conflicts, provide a framework for societies to recover and build sustainable peace. Healing the conflicts within individuals could help them to resolve the conflicts around them. 70.",

        "hat strengthens resilience to crises and addresses the humanitarian-development-peace nexus. This anticipates and prevents multiple risks. It helps restart development so people are less prone to crisis and better positioned to flourish. In complex crises, where people are worse off on every indicator of multidimensional poverty, such integrated approaches are critical. 35. In crisis after crisis, through its early recovery approach, UNDP meets acute human security needs for services, safety and voice: \u2022 Lebanon: UNDP and national institutions provided energy, agriculture, water and public safety services to nearly 600,000 residents and refugees. Social cohesion initiatives eased tensions among nearly 500,000 people. \u2022 Ukraine: UNDP restored water systems, schools and healthcare facilities for over 510,000 people. Surveys of land for unexploded ordnance and other war-related hazards released 3.9 million square meters to restart agriculture and other economic activities. Signature solutions and enablers - Resilience - Poverty and inequality - Energy - Gender equality - Digital SPOTLIGHT: Safety and stability - 50 per cent of expenditure to countries in fragile contexts - 54 countries with risk-informed, gender- responsive recovery solutions - 2.6 million people with jobs and livelihoods in 46 crisis-affected countries - Outreach to 2.5 million people to counter violent extremism in the Sahel - 80,000 women-owned business in Afghanistan DP/2025/12 11 \u2022 Gaza: UNDP and partners collected over 210,000 tons of solid waste, benefiting 624,000 people, and provided 600,000 people with access to clean water through solar-powered desalination units. 36. Towards prevention and stabilization in north-east Nigeria, UNDP and local authorities helped improve security and services, including legal aid for human rights violations and violence against women. This bolstered social cohesion and trust in communities with nearly 800,000 people. Cash grants, agricultural inputs and vocational skills strengthened livelihoods and local economies for 10,000 households. In Benin, Burkina Faso, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Ghana and Togo, local dialogues, income-generating activities and public outreach campaigns collectively reached more than 2.5 million people, helping to counter risks of violent extremism from the Sahel. 37. Integrated solutions create a foundation for recovery. Since 2021, UNDP has reached 25 million people across Afghanistan with combined support for essential services, infrastructure and small businesses. UNDP provided some of the only services and livelihood opportunities for women and girls, including through supporting 80,000 women-owned businesses that have created over 1 million jobs and livelihoods. In Mozambique, UNDP with other development actors supported 600,000 internally displaced persons to return to their communities by strengthening the public responsiveness of local governments, rehabilitating infrastructure and re-establishing livelihoods. 38. Crises also provide opportunities, as UNDP has helped demonstrate through support for women in mediation, reconciliation and peacebuilding in 25 countries. In the Philippines, the Women Insider Mediators Rapid Action and Mobilization Platform advances women\u2019s leadership. It helped maintain peace during recent elections in the Bangsamoro region and works with communities to close gaps in health care, education and livelihoods. 39. Digital solutions increase capacities to respond and reduce risks. Turkmenistan has deployed satellite technology for integrated land-use planning based on a clearer understanding of disaster, climate and biodiversity risks. Digital insurance products, introduced in the Pacific region by the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) with local ecosystem partners, have improved the resilience of over 26,000 households in five countries. Digital and data tools in Guatemala have enhanced understanding of crime patterns and improve security responses. Globally, the UNDP Risk Anticipation Hub provides data and analysis for over 30 countries to inform fast and effective decision- making on multiple preventive actions. D. Governance is the foundation for human development 40. UNDP governance work is a cornerstone for human development. Strengthening institutions, processes and civic participation unleashes progress across all development areas. Nearly 80 per cent of UNDP country achievements integrate governance with other signature solutions to amplify development impact. The Strategic Plan evaluation concluded that UNDP drives transformative solutions by strengthening both public institutions and individual agency.

We will implement comprehensive strategies for the prevention, early diagnosis, management and treatment of noncommunicable diseases and mental health conditions in line with national priorities and contexts and assist developing countries in their efforts to reduce mortality and morbidity from such diseases. We also commit to address the threat of antimicrobial resistance in the treatment of noncommunicable diseases. We welcome the extension of the United Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition to align it with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and to maintain the political momentum at the global, regional and national levels to ending malnutrition in all its forms by 2030. 45. We express deep concern about the continued prevalence of food insecurity and malnutrition in different regions of the world and their ongoing negative impacts on the health and well-being of people, and reaffirm our collective commitment to end hunger and malnutrition by 2030. We recognize that food security and safety, adequate nutrition, and sustainable, resilient and diverse nutrition-sensitive food systems are critical to promoting healthier populations and achieving sustainable development, including through addressing malnutrition in all its forms. We further acknowledge the vital contribution of more efficient, inclusive, resilient and sustainable agrifood systems in fostering healthy diets, improving nutrition outcomes, and preventing and controlling noncommunicable diseases, and underscore the intrinsic links between food safety, adequate nutrition and health. 46. We recognize the tremendous global burden that road traffic crashes place on society in terms of both human suffering and economic losses. We note the Second Decade of Action for Road Safety 2021\u20132030 and look forward to the second high- level meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on improving global road safety in 2026. 47. We commit to greater cooperation in medical research, sharing experience and best practices, early warning and response systems, and technology transfer on mutually agreed terms. 48. We urge timely, equitable and unhindered access to safe, affordable, effective and quality medicines, vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics and other health products and technologies as one of the fundamental elements for the full realization of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and the correspondent objectives of universal health coverage and health for all, without discrimination, with special attention to reaching those furthest behind first. 49. We recognize the transformative potential of digital health technologies, including assistive technologies, in advancing health promotion, well-being for all at all ages and workforce capacity, enhancing disease prevention, supporting the achievement of universal health coverage and health-related Sustainable Development Goals, but also recognize the need of taking measure to ensure digital health equity and foster digital health literacy. 50. We commit to setting up supportive structures for integrated policies and actions to support mental health, including in the digital sphere, reduce stigma and improve access to diagnosis and treatment. 51. We note with serious concern the severe shortcomings the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed at national, regional and global levels in terms of timely, effective prevention, preparedness, detection of and response to potential health emergencies, and consequently the challenges this creates to achieve Sustainable Development E/2025/L.16 E/HLPF/2025/L.1 9/21 25-11473 Goal 3, including in the capacity and resilience of all health systems, especially in developing countries, while recognizing the positive role and contributions of millions of migrants in responding to and recovering from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, including as essential workers, and remaining deeply concerned that the pandemic has had a severe and disproportionate impact on migrants, and recognizing also the need to promote equitable access of developing countries, particularly African countries, to safe, quality, efficacious, effective, accessible and affordable vaccines, including COVID-19. 52. We recognize the need to support developing countries to build expertise and strengthen local and regional production of vaccines, medicines, diagnostics and other health technologies in order to facilitate equitable access, recognizing that the high prices of some health products and the inequitable access to such products impede progress towards achieving universal health coverage, particularly for developing countries, and express concern that the supply of health products and technologies",

In parallel to this work on the overall effectiveness of support to least developed countries, there is also a need to update 4/28 25-04788 the procedures for graduation to reduce uncertainty and increase the transparency of current and upcoming graduation processes. The Committee developed a series of proposals so that the procedures can address the various disruptions that graduation processes may entail. While some of the proposals can be implemented by the Committee within its existing mandates, several others could be considered within a process to update the existing resolutions on smooth transition from the least developed country category. In its enhanced monitoring of countries that are graduating or have graduated from the category, the Committee reviewed the development progress of two recently graduated countries and six graduating countries. Expressing concern over the limited national capacity of these countries to address various challenges, including those stemming from multiple global crises, less affordable finance, geopolitical tensions, and climate change, the Committee underscored the importance of addressing these issues with continued support from trading and development partners, including United Nations entities. The Committee welcomed the positive feedback and increased and active participation of countries in the enhanced monitoring mechanism and encouraged continued progress in reporting on the preparation and implementation of smooth transition strategies. It reviewed the structure and operation of the mechanism and proposes further improvements and clarifications to better address the needs of graduating and graduated countries. 25-04788 5/28 [24 March 2025] Contents Chapter Page I.

As the United Nations approaches its eightieth anniversary, it finds itself at a crossroads that requires an unequivocal reaffirmation of the need for a strong multilateral system; of the values espoused in the Charter of the United Nations; and of the pledge to leave no one behind. Trust in the multilateral system relies on its effectiveness. Too many commitments remain unmet, and many aspects of the system remain structurally inadequate in a world that continues to be widely asymmetric, in which convergence in economic, human and social development has not proved to be the norm, and that currently faces fundamental structural shifts. These include a breaching of multiple planetary boundaries; geopolitical and geoeconomic shifts; increasing inequalities, including of access to the global commons and natural capital; technological change, particularly artificial intelligence; a weakening role of the State; and a decline in commitments to norms and values underpinning the international order. 2. Responding to those realities and ensuring a voice and representation for all countries is a matter of effectiveness of the system as much as of fairness. The multilateral system must support the capacity, policy space and fiscal space of States to address the long-standing goals of poverty eradication, equality, and structural transformation of their economies, as well as to face new challenges such as those related to the ecological crisis and major technological changes."

      "question": "What are the main themes in Commission on Status of Women reports?",
      "answer": "The reports from the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) highlight several key themes that reflect ongoing challenges and commitments regarding gender equality and women's empowerment. Here are some of the main themes identified in the recent reports:\n\n1. **Gender Equality and Economic Empowerment**: A significant focus is placed on the economic empowerment of women and girls, recognizing the persistent issue of the feminization of poverty. The reports emphasize the need for countries to invest in care and support systems, enhance financial inclusion, and ensure equal access to economic opportunities. This aligns with the commitment to eradicate poverty and promote sustainable development, as highlighted in the draft ministerial declaration for the high-level segment of the Economic and Social Council [2].\n\n2. **Violence Against Women**: The reports underscore the alarming rates of violence against women and girls, including domestic violence and the use of technology to perpetrate harm. The need for comprehensive frameworks to eliminate violence, including in digital spaces, is a recurring theme. The adoption of resolutions aimed at addressing these issues reflects a growing recognition of the need for systemic change [3].\n\n3. **Participation and Leadership**: There is a strong emphasis on increasing women's participation in decision-making processes across all sectors. The reports note the ongoing challenges women face in achieving leadership roles and the importance of facilitating their representation in political and economic spheres. This theme is particularly relevant in the context of electoral processes, where efforts are being made to support women's candidacies [3].\n\n4. **Intersectionality and Vulnerable Groups**: The reports highlight the need to address the unique challenges faced by women in vulnerable situations, including those in conflict settings, Indigenous women, and migrant workers. The recognition of multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination is crucial for developing targeted strategies that promote inclusivity and equity [2].\n\n5. **Sustainable Development and Environmental Issues**: The integration of gender perspectives into environmental and climate change policies is increasingly recognized as essential. The reports call for gender-responsive approaches to disaster risk reduction and climate action, acknowledging the disproportionate impacts of these issues on women and girls [2].\n\n6. **Accountability and Governance**: The reports also address the importance of strengthening governance frameworks to ensure accountability in the implementation of gender equality commitments. This includes enhancing organizational culture within UN-Women and other entities to foster an inclusive environment that prioritizes gender equality [4][5].\n\nThese themes reflect a comprehensive approach to addressing the multifaceted challenges women face globally, emphasizing the need for collaborative efforts among member states, civil society, and international organizations to achieve meaningful progress in gender equality and women's empowerment. Would you like to explore any specific theme in more detail?",

We acknowledge the mutually reinforcing links between the achievement of gender equality, the empowerment of all women and girls and the eradication of poverty. We emphasize the importance of support for countries in their efforts to eradicate poverty. We recognize the role of social and financial institutions in lifting women and girls out of poverty, and also recognize that countries, who bear the main responsibility for social integration and social inclusion, should invest in care and support systems and, in this regard, we commit to increasing investment in the economy, including the care economy, as well as strengthening social and financial inclusion and economic empowerment. 58. We commit to ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights as agreed in accordance with the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development 19 and the Beijing Platform for Action and the outcome documents of their review conferences. 59.

        "United Nations UNW/2025/2 Executive Board of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women Distr.: General 11 April 2025 Original: English 25-05955 (E) 020525 *2505955* Annual session of 2025 17\u201319 June 2025 Item 2 of the provisional agenda Annual Report of the Executive Director Report of the Under-Secretary-General/Executive Director of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women on the implementation of the Strategic Plan 2022\u20132025 Summary This is the third annual report of the UN-Women Executive Director on the implementation of the Strategic Plan 2022\u20132025. This penultimate report presents results from the first three years of implementing the Strategic Plan. It is accompanied by various annexes, including the Transparency Portal, which provides additional detail on the Entity\u2019s results, an annex on the implementation of the quadrennial comprehensive policy review of operational activities for development of the United Nations system, and an annex on the independent oversight functions/ bodies in UN-Women. Elements of a draft decision are presented in section VII. UNW/2025/2 25-05955 2/25 I. Introduction 1. UN-Women\u2019s work with its partners in 2024 affirmed more strongly than ever the centrality of its mandate and the imperative of gender equality in a challenging global context. Long-established inequalities interacted with rising geopolitical tensions, alongside accelerated technological change and ever more complex conflicts. Global developments presented both opportunities and threats to women and girls, with UN-Women and its partners working tirelessly to realise the former and mitigate the latter. 2. While many countries saw a backlash against women\u2019s rights, the movement for gender equality remained robust and energetic from global multilateral spaces to the work of grassroots women\u2019s organisations, supported at every level by UN-Women. Carrying out its triple mandate, and with investments of $622.8 million in 109 countries/territories, the Entity secured tangible results for women and girls across all four impact areas of the Strategic Plan 2022\u20132025 as laid out in this report. Further, it continued down the path of organizational improvement and transparency, with measurable improvements in effectiveness and efficiency that equip it to continue to better deliver results for women and girls everywhere. 3. While advances occurred, developing countries continue to confront a staggering annual gender financing gap of $420 billion. Over 3.3 billion people live in countries where debt interest payments now exceed expenditures on health or education. This disproportionately affects women, with only 18 per cent of social protection measures adopted by governments since 2022 targeting women\u2019s economic security. In 2024, UN-Women supported 70 countries to increase financing for gender equality and 50 countries to transform care systems through long-term financing, more comprehensive data collection, strengthening normative and policy frameworks, and shifting discriminatory social norms. The 2024 Commission on the Status of Women underscored the critical need to finance gender equality, and highlighted the centrality of social protection, public services and sustainable infrastructure in addressing poverty among women and girls. In 2025, the Fourth International Conference on Financing for Development presents a crucial opportunity for Member States to advance commitments and reform the international financial architecture so it is fit for purpose to mobilize resources for the full implementation of the SDGs. 4. Violence against women persists at alarming levels, with an estimated 140 women and girls killed every day by a family member. Increasingly, technology is weaponized to harm women and girls. Anti-rights actors use online spaces to attack women\u2019s rights, fuel misogyny and normalize violence, while artificial intelligence facilitates the insidious spread of targeted disinformation. Drawing on UN-Women\u2019s evidence and technical expertise, the United Nations General Assembly passed its first resolution on eliminating all forms of violence against women and girls in the digital realm. This comprehensive framework will further support national efforts to end such violence. Since 2022, with UN-Women\u2019s support, 30 countries have adopted, revised or repealed 148 laws to end violence against women. 5. Women\u2019s limited role in decision-making persists across all sectors and levels. In 2024, a \u201cmega-elections\u201d year, UN-Women worked with electoral stakeholders and civil society to facilitate women\u2019s strengthened participation and representation. Only 5 women were elected in 31 direct presidential elections.",

In conclusion, she stressed UN-Women\u2019s role as a leader in mainstreaming gender equality in UN80 reforms and expressed UN-Women\u2019s support for the revitalization of the Commission on the Status of Women and the implementation of the Pact for the Future. 42. After opening the floor, a delegation speaking on behalf of 30 Member States welcomed the Secretary-General\u2019s UN80 initiative and stressed that UN80 builds on reforms already under way. The group emphasized that they see great potential in the further consolidation and increased use of shared services, common back offices and common premises. It then asked the Secretariat what actions UN-Women is taking to consolidate joint business operations within the United Nations system and requested UNW/2025/6 25-12751 16/22 that UN-Women keep Member States informed of current cost reduction measures. The group noted with concern that implementation of the Management and Accountability Framework has stalled and asked how UN-Women will ensure improved implementation of this framework. The group also asked UN-Women to elaborate on challenges faced in sufficiently implementing the dual reporting model. The group further noted that Resident Coordinators estimate that 79 per cent of entity- specific programming instruments are aligned with the cooperation framework, but argued that this alignment does not translate into genuine derivation from the cooperation frameworks into agency-specific plans. Finally, the group called on UN- Women to connect ongoing business model reviews and reorganization exercises to the goal of needs-based country presence. 43. Responding to Member States\u2019 comments, the Deputy Executive Director for Normative Support, United Nations System Coordination and Programme Results expressed appreciation for Member States\u2019 guidance on United Nations reforms. She noted that UN-Women brings gender equality issues to the foreground of discussions in the United Nations system Development Cluster within UN80. She also emphasized UN-Women\u2019s involvement in the United Nations system coordination evaluation review, recognizing Member States\u2019 commentary on proper alignment. The Deputy Executive Director further noted that UN-Women works within the United Nations system to define gender outcomes at the cooperation level, including through joint programmes. The Deputy Executive Director for Resource Management, Sustainability and Partnerships emphasized that UN-Women\u2019s business model requires external services to ensure efficiency. She noted UN-Women\u2019s commitment to the use of common premises, but emphasized that there were not significant savings in country offices with common back offices. She further underlined the importance of global shared services in optimizing efficiency and pooling resources across the United Nations system. In response to the question from Member States regarding the Management Accountability Framework, the Deputy Director of the United Nations system Coordination Division noted UN-Women\u2019s engagement in the Management and Accountability Framework update and review process, especially in gender and human rights contexts. The Deputy Director also noted that despite UN-Women\u2019s nearly 90 per cent compliance with the dual reporting model, there is still room for improvement. She emphasized the mutually reinforcing relationship between UN- Women and Resident Coordinators in advancing the gender equality agenda. The Director of SPRED noted that UN-Women has a mandatory step of soliciting inputs throughout the strategic note development process from the Resident Coordinator, as well as a sign-off and approval of the Resident Coordinator. The SPRED Director concluded her response by emphasizing that the Secretariat works closely with regional directors in collaboration with relevant divisions and at UN-Women Headquarters to maximize results where country-based needs are the greatest. XII. Update on policies and procedures to tackle sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment 44. The Under-Secretary-General/Executive Director delivered an update on UN- Women policies and procedures to tackle sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment. She reaffirmed UN-Women\u2019s commitment to preventing and responding to sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA) and sexual harassment (SH), emphasizing its importance as both a moral duty and a matter of trust. The Head of UN-Women noted progress in the following areas: strengthened and more accessible survivor-centred reporting mechanisms, with over 90 per cent of staff knowing how to report SEA/SH, risk assessments integrating SEA/SH considerations in 98 per cent of risk-owning units, a",

      "question": "How do UN reports assess progress on SDGs?",
      "answer": "Assessing progress on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is a multifaceted process that involves various methodologies and frameworks outlined in UN reports. Here\u2019s a synthesis of how this assessment is approached based on the current context of UN documents:\n\n1. **Data Availability and Quality**: A significant aspect of assessing progress is the availability of gender-disaggregated data and statistics. For instance, the report from UN-Women indicates that data to monitor gender-responsive indicators of the SDGs has increased significantly, reaching 56% in 2024, which is a 30 percentage point increase since 2016. This improvement in data availability is crucial for informing policies and programs across different countries, as seen in Colombia and Georgia, where specific initiatives have been supported by UN-Women to enhance data collection and usage [1].\n\n2. **Integration into National Plans**: Reports highlight the integration of gender statistics into national plans and the establishment of coordination mechanisms to enhance data production and use. For example, in 2024, gender statistics were integrated into 24 national plans, and 61 coordination mechanisms were established, showcasing a structured approach to embedding SDG indicators into national frameworks [1].\n\n3. **Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs)**: The assessment of progress is also facilitated through VNRs, where countries present their efforts to integrate the SDGs into national policies. The draft ministerial declaration emphasizes the importance of these reviews as tools for sharing knowledge and tracking progress, encouraging countries to prepare evidence-based reports that reflect local development priorities [3]. The involvement of various stakeholders, including local authorities and civil society, is encouraged to ensure comprehensive assessments.\n\n4. **Challenges and Gaps**: Despite advancements, reports indicate critical gaps, particularly in funding for gender data initiatives. Many countries rely heavily on external funding for their gender data activities, and a significant portion of official development assistance is not directed towards these efforts. This lack of funding can hinder the ability to collect and analyze data effectively, which is essential for tracking SDG progress [1].\n\n5. **Global and Regional Initiatives**: The UN reports also highlight global initiatives aimed at accelerating the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. For instance, the \"Pact for the Future\" outlines commitments from heads of state to undertake specific actions to address current challenges and ensure progress towards the SDGs [2]. This collective approach underscores the importance of international cooperation in achieving the goals.\n\n6. **Outcome Measurement**: The reports often include specific metrics and indicators to measure progress against the SDGs. For example, UNOPS reported that only 17% of the SDG targets were on track in 2024, with many showing minimal or moderate progress, indicating a need for intensified efforts [2]. \n\nIn summary, UN reports assess progress on the SDGs through a combination of improved data collection, integration into national frameworks, stakeholder engagement via VNRs, and recognition of existing challenges. This comprehensive approach aims to ensure that progress is not only tracked but also effectively communicated and acted upon at all levels of governance.",

Over 40 per cent of partners accessed funding from the United Nations for the first time, and 59 per cent secured additional resources to respond to crises and advance peace and the elimination of violence against women and girls. J. Outcome 6: Production, analysis and use of gender statistics and sex-disaggregated data and knowledge 56. Data available to monitor the gender-responsive indicators of the SDGs has increased by 30 percentage points since 2016, reaching 56 per cent. The contributions of UN-Women to this strong result continued in 2024, influencing laws, policies and programmes in 22 countries. In Colombia, an extensive government effort to inventory properties across the country, supported by UN-Women, is helping advance peace agreement goals, including to expand the percentage of titled women landowners. In Georgia, findings from a Violence against Women Survey, supported by UN-Women, led to increased awareness and shelter donations, including from the private sector. Tonga\u2019s first gender and environment survey increased accountability for implementing its disaster risk management policy. 116% >= 90% Progress >= 60% Progress 0-59% Progress UNW/2025/2 17/25 25-05955 57. Critical gaps persist, however, with limited funding proving a particular challenge. Despite countries relying on external funding for over half their gender data activities, nearly half of OECD Development Assistance Committee members allocate negligible percentages of official development assistance to gender data- related efforts. Nevertheless, in 2024, gender statistics were integrated into 24 national plans, and 61 coordination mechanisms were established to enhance production and use. UN-Women supported 80 gender statistics initiatives, including 26 surveys on violence against women, time use, and gender and the environment. 58. In Afghanistan, Lebanon and the State of Palestine, UN-Women co-led the scaling up of eight inter-agency coordination mechanisms, building on data-driven gender analysis and knowledge products to integrate gender in humanitarian response planning and decision-making. 59. UN-Women led the production of cutting-edge gender data and research, launching key global reports that informed policy, advocacy and accountability efforts worldwide. The Gender Data Outlook 2024, co-produced with OECD, assessed gender data capacities across 83 countries. This informed priority-setting for gender data capacity development, including new initiatives to strengthen statistical systems and enhance data collection in Ethiopia and Nigeria. 60. UN-Women published Progress on the Sustainable Development Goals: The Gender Snapshot 2024, in collaboration with the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. This annual report continues to be a key resource for gender equality advocates to ensure accountability for the achievement of the Goals. UN-Women also drove accountability for gender equality financing and results through the Generation Equality Accountability Report 2024. Findings included that Generation Equality is propelling operational and normative results through over 12,000 new or scaled-up policies, programmes and advocacy initiatives. 61. The World Survey on the Role of Women in Development, compiled in collaboration with United Nations agencies and bilateral donors, was launched in 2024 and featured groundbreaking new data and analysis of social protection policies for women and girls. The report has informed policy dialogues with national governments convened by three UN-Women regional and multi-country offices. K. Outcome 7: United Nations system coordination for gender equality 102% >= 90% Progress >= 60% Progress 0-59% Progress UNW/2025/2 25-05955 18/25 62. The 2024 launch of the United Nations System-Wide Gender Equality Acceleration Plan signalled the increased commitment of the United Nations to advancing gender equality and women\u2019s rights. Delivering for women and girls amid uneven progress on the gender equality targets of the global Goals requires strong and sustained leadership by the United Nations. With its unique triple mandate, UN-Women has a pivotal role in driving this at both the institutional and programmatic levels. 63. At the institutional level, implementation of Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) resolutions on gender mainstreaming and the 2024 quadrennial comprehensive policy review (QCPR) is progressing. In 2024, 75 entities implemented the United Nations System-Wide Action Plan on Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-SWAP 2.0) and 17 entities the newly-launched UN-SWAP 3.",

In 2024, progress towards the 2030 Agenda remained off track. Only 17 per cent of the Goals targets are on track; nearly half are showing minimal or moderate progress; and progress on over one third has stalled or regressed.3 Climate change affects those most vulnerable 5. Global greenhouse gas emissions set a new record in 2023.4People living in situations of fragility, conflict and violence are especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change. It is estimated that, by 2030, nearly 60 per cent of the world\u2019s extreme poor will live in fragile countries affected by conflict and violence.5 The global economy exacerbates inequalities 6. The global economic outlook improved in 2024, but was marked by uncertainty and uneven distribution.6 The annual financing gap for developing countries reached about $4 trillion.7 Pact for the future to accelerate implementation of the 2030 Agenda 7. In September 2024, heads and state of government committed to 56 actions to ensure the future we want and to effectively respond to current and future challenges, in partnership with all relevant stakeholders8. The repositioned development system 8. Through the quadrennial comprehensive policy review, the General Assembly establishes key system-wide strategic policy orientations and operational modalities for the development cooperation and country-level modalities of the United Nations development system. 9. The 2024 review reiterated the call on the United Nations development system to seek comparative advantages based on mandates, and to mainstream key decisions into their strategic plans. These include mainstreaming the Sustainable Development Goals, disability inclusion, climate- and environment-responsive approaches, the Doha Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries (resolution 76/258), the Antigua and Barbuda agenda for small island developing States (resolution 78/317), the Gaborone programme of action for landlocked developing countries for the decade 2024-2034 (resolution 79/233), South-South and triangular cooperation, and the special needs of middle-income countries.9 1 Decision 2022/13 2 Decisions 2021/20 and 2023/16 3 Sustainable Development Goals Report, 2024 4 UNEP Emissions Gap Report, 2024 5 Fragility, Conflict and Violence 6 World Economic Situation and Prospects as of mid-2024 7 Financing for Sustainable Development Report, 2024 8 Summit of the Future outcome document 9 A/C.2/79/L.60 DP/OPS/2025/6 5 III. Ambition for impact A. Contributing to impact through projects while harnessing capacity for missions 10. In 2024, UNOPS implemented more than 1,100 projects across over 130 countries10 for a value of about $2.7 billion: 83 per cent for development activities, 11 per cent humanitarian, and 6 per cent peace and security. 11. UNOPS assigns projects to the main Goal to which they are expected to contribute. In 2024, two Goals accounted for about half of UNOPS activities: Goal 3, \u2018good health and well-being\u2019 (37 per cent); and Goal 16, \u2018peace, justice and strong institutions\u2019 (14 per cent). 12. In 2023, the UNOPS Executive Director initiated a process to harness knowledge and capacity through eight missions. These are internal communities and networks intended to foster collaboration; they are not an expression of external programmatic intent. 13. The missions can be summarized in three groups. The following paragraphs illustrate the challenges and examples of the solutions UNOPS has implemented. Accelerate sustainable development 14. Triple planetary crisis. The crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution is an existential threat. Currently 3.6 billion people live in areas highly susceptible to climate change, and 21.5 million are displaced each year by climate-change related disasters. 15. Energy transition. By 2030, an estimated 660 million people will lack electricity access and around 1.8 billion will go without clean cooking fuels and technologies. (The energy sector is responsible for 73 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions.) 16. Just digital transformation. Approximately 2.6 billion people remain off-line, and only 50 per cent of the rural population use the internet (compared to 81 per cent of the urban population). 17. Food system transformation. An estimated 28.9 percent of the global population \u2013 2.33 billion people \u2013 were moderately or severely food insecure in 2023. Practical solutions accelerating sustainable development.

We will consider using complementary measures of progress that go beyond gross domestic product as a complement to existing policies and practices. These measures should reflect progress on the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development, including in the consideration of informing access to development finance and technical cooperation, to ensure an inclusive approach to international cooperation. 120. We reaffirm our political commitment to fully and timely implement the commitments contained in General Assembly resolution 79/1 to establish measures of progress on sustainable development that complement or go beyond gross domestic product to have a more inclusive approach to international cooperation and inform access to development finance. We welcome the establishment of an independent high-level expert group to develop recommendations for a limited number of country- owned and universally applicable indicators of sustainable development that complement and go beyond gross domestic product and look forward to a subsequent United Nations-led intergovernmental process. 121. We welcome the adoption of General Assembly resolution 78/322 on the multidimensional vulnerability index and call for the full and effective implementation of its mandate. 122. We note that data availability, which has strengthened the evidence base for policymaking, has improved but more needs to be done given the existing gaps. Greater partnerships, innovation and capacity-building are needed to ensure that data are accessible, usable and reliable. 123. We welcome also the meaningful involvement and participation of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the multilateral development banks in the high-level political forum on sustainable development. Voluntary national reviews 124. We commend the 35 countries that presented voluntary national reviews at the 2025 high-level political forum on sustainable development. 125. We recognize that the voluntary national reviews presented by countries reflect their efforts to integrate the Sustainable Development Goals into national plans and policies and acknowledge the need to continue supporting countries in the voluntary national reviews, including through the Group of Friends of the Voluntary National Reviews co-chaired by Morocco and the Philippines. We encourage all countries to present their voluntary national reviews before 2030. 126. We encourage all countries to use the key findings of their voluntary national reviews and the sharing of locally driven development approaches and pathways to accelerate actions to implement the 2030 Agenda. We encourage greater support for developing countries in the preparation of more evidence- and data-based voluntary national reviews, to strengthen, inter alia, the capacity of national statistical offices and data systems to ensure access to high-quality, timely, reliable and disaggregated data and enable them to fully participate in and benefit from these learning and collaboration opportunities. We underscore the value of peer learning as a powerful tool to foster mutual understanding and inspire innovative solutions. 127. We will strengthen the use of voluntary national reviews as a tool for sharing knowledge and tracking progress, involving all relevant stakeholders. E/2025/L.16 E/HLPF/2025/L.1 21/21 25-11473 128. We encourage the full, equal and meaningful participation of all relevant stakeholders, including local governments, civil society organizations, academia and the private sector, in the design, implementation, monitoring, evaluation and reporting of national sustainable development strategies and in the preparation of voluntary national reviews. 129. We encourage countries to consider developing national road maps of voluntary national reviews for presentation until 2030 and to support local authorities in the preparation of voluntary local reviews. 130. We recognize that the voluntary national reviews presented by countries reflect their efforts to integrate the Sustainable Development Goals into national plans and policies and acknowledge the need to continue supporting countries in the voluntary national reviews, including the work of the Group of Friends of the Voluntary National Reviews.",

They proposed sharpening thematic priorities and clarifying the UNDP narrative on its role in a rapidly changing development space. 67. On resources, delegations called for donor countries to uphold their contributions and for programme countries to take a more proactive role in financing UNDP initiatives within their borders. They expressed concern about resource limitations forcing the agency to work on a project basis. They suggested rethinking resource mobilization strategies, introducing innovations to secure the regular budget, and expanding the donor base. 68. On programming and partnerships, delegations commended efforts to close gaps across humanitarian, peace, and development action. They lauded support for complex transitions and welcomed integrated programming approaches. Delegates also called for increased attention to ending gender and racial inequality, and enhancing capacity-building and triangular cooperation. One delegation sought insights on UNDP support for the right to development. 69. In response to delegations, the Administrator affirmed the significance of UNDP investment in digital technologies. Regarding artificial intelligence, he underscored the need for tested models to understand how this technology will interface with development and shape future offers. The strategic planning preparation process has reaffirmed that UNDP support is most valued at the intersection of development issues, where it can help address the complexity of development systems. 70. He stated that the strategic plan would reflect the quadrennial comprehensive policy review, the Pact for the Future, outcomes from the extensive consultations, and decisions by the United Nations and the Executive Board. He highlighted priorities, including the revenue model and partnership processes, emphasizing that UNDP had diversified its funding and continued to do so. Due to potential disruptions in core funding, UNDP is implementing mitigation measures. At the same time, with improved monitoring, transparency, and a 30 per cent reduction in operational costs over the last decade, the discussion could advance toward a realistic approach to efficiency and effectiveness, including through comparisons with other multilateral and bilateral DP/2025/8 11 organizations. The Administrator noted that UNDP collaborates closely with United Nations entities. 71. He concluded by describing UNDP as a trusted platform for engaging in development decisions that matter both to individual countries and to the global community. UNDP is integral to the United Nations and serves as a unique source of value for the international community. IX. Human Development Report 72. The Director of the Human Development Report Office provided an update on the Human Development Report consultations, stating that the upcoming report is the second in a trilogy addressing global uncertainty. The report will focus on harnessing artificial intelligence for human development, following a report on polarization. The third report in the series will address planetary change. He noted wide uptake of the reports, with eight million page views on their website recorded in 2024. 73. Consultations for the forthcoming report have covered all five regions and engaged experts and leaders from industry, academia, trade, labour, human rights, and United Nations organizations, amongst others. 74. The Executive Board took note of the update on the Human Development Report. X. UNDP country programmes and related matters 75. The UNDP Associate Administrator presented an overview of the new UNDP country programme documents for Bahrain, Colombia, Iraq, Paraguay and Rwanda, and the extensions for the country programmes for Guatemala, Kuwait, Mali and the Republic of Sudan. 76. The regional directors for Africa, the Arab States, and Latin America and the Caribbean provided insights from their respective regions. 77. The Executive Board, in line with decision 2014/7, approved the UNDP country programme documents for Bahrain (DP/DCP/BHR/4), Colombia (DP/DCP/COL/4), Iraq (DP/DCP/IRQ/4), Paraguay (DP/DCP/PRY/4) and Rwanda (DP/DCP/RWA/4), ensuring alignment with national priorities and the UNDP Strategic Plan. 78.

Least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing States (SIDS), and conflict-affected and fragile countries stand at a pivotal moment. They are brimming with potential yet beset by persistent challenges that hold back progress on the Sustainable Development Goals. Not least among these is the need to drive increased funding to areas most in need. Having long been seen as high-risk by the traditional financial architecture, these regions and countries have been underserved and lack the resources required to build inclusive economies and adapt to a changing climate. 2. Extreme poverty levels remain significantly high. Coupled with debt-to-gross domestic product (GDP) levels at their highest point in decades, rising food prices have increased food insecurity, instability and the risk of hunger. Less than half the population in LDCs have access to basic sanitation and some 500 million people still lack access to electricity.1 More than 231 million people in LDCs were expected to require humanitarian assistance in 2024, compared with 190 million in 2022.2 3. Making progress on the Sustainable Development Goals in these countries and achieving our collective goal of leaving no one behind will require additional support to strengthen productive capacities, develop and diversify inclusive economies and provide affordable access to adequate financial resources. Despite a record $287 billion in global official development assistance (ODA) in 2022, aid to LDCs fell by 4 per cent to $62 billion,3 following an 8 per cent decrease the previous year, while aid to SIDS fell by 13 per cent to $5.9 billion."

      "question": "What digital transformation initiatives are mentioned in UN documents?",
      "answer": "Digital transformation initiatives are a significant focus in various UN documents, reflecting the organization's commitment to leveraging technology for sustainable development. Here are some key initiatives mentioned across the provided reports:\n\n1. **UNDP's Digital Strategy**: The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has been actively implementing its Digital Strategy, which aims to harness digital technology to support the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This strategy emphasizes the importance of tailoring digital initiatives to the specific contexts of over 90 countries, ensuring that they are inclusive and people-centered. UNDP is also focusing on enhancing governance and ethical approaches to digital transformation, recognizing the varying levels of digital readiness among countries [1].\n\n2. **Collaboration Across UN Agencies**: The Commission on Science and Technology for Development highlights the collaborative efforts of various UN agencies in promoting digital inclusion. For instance, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is working on digital infrastructure to support poverty reduction and food security, while the International Labour Organization (ILO) is examining the impact of technological change on jobs, particularly for women and vulnerable populations. This integrated approach underscores the interconnectedness of digital initiatives across different sectors [2].\n\n3. **Gender Digital Divide Initiatives**: The reports also address the persistent gender digital divide, noting that while internet usage among women and girls is increasing, it still lags behind that of men. Various initiatives, such as International Girls in ICT Day and the EQUALS initiative, aim to enhance women's participation in technology and address technology-facilitated gender-based violence. These efforts are crucial for ensuring that digital transformation is equitable and inclusive [2].\n\n4. **UNEP's ICT Governance Framework**: The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has established an ICT governance framework to support its operations and enhance digital transformation. This framework includes a structured approach to data and digital governance, which is essential for the effective implementation of UNEP's activities across various locations [3].\n\n5. **UNCTAD's Focus on Inclusive AI**: The Technology and Innovation Report 2025 emphasizes the need for inclusive artificial intelligence (AI) as part of the broader digital transformation agenda. It advocates for global collaboration to ensure that AI technologies are developed and implemented in ways that are equitable and beneficial for all, particularly in developing countries [4].\n\n6. **UNOPS Projects**: The United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) is implementing numerous projects that incorporate digital solutions to enhance development outcomes. In 2024, for example, UNOPS focused on projects related to health and well-being, peace and justice, and sustainable development, integrating digital tools to improve efficiency and impact [5].\n\nThese initiatives illustrate the UN's comprehensive approach to digital transformation, emphasizing collaboration, inclusivity, and the need to address specific challenges faced by different populations. The ongoing efforts reflect a recognition that digital technology can be a powerful enabler for achieving the SDGs, provided it is implemented thoughtfully and equitably.",

        "ddress contemporary challenges. UNDP is reimagining governance for a digital age, focusing on institutions that can accelerate progress on the Sustainable Development Goals while navigating complex transitions. It is leveraging digital transformation strategically. UNDP has supported over 90 countries in implementing whole-of-society digital initiatives, yet recognizes the need to better tailor strategies to different contexts. Future initiatives will address varying levels of digital readiness while enhancing governance and ethics approaches to ensure people-centred, inclusive digital advances. \u2022 Enhancing efficiency. The Business Model Review, in addition to examining UNDP\u2019s value proposition and funding, revealed opportunities to enhance strategic positioning and operational efficiency. While UNDP has significantly increased the proportion of funding going directly to development and reduced costs, the organization must further adapt business processes to support diverse partnerships and innovative financing. Current improvements include streamlining processes, creating flexible operational modalities, and investing in risk management approaches that balance innovation with accountability. DP/2025/12 22 Path Forward 82. As UNDP prepares the next Strategic Plan, consultations across 115 countries have consistently emphasised three demands: the importance of aligning strategies with countries\u2019 national priorities and evolving with their development needs, systemic and integrated approaches that address interconnected challenges, and multistakeholder partnerships that bridge local and global perspectives. 83. These insights will help shape the future direction as UNDP builds on strengths while addressing areas for improvement. The organization remains committed to continuous learning and adaptation, ensuring responsiveness to today's development challenges while anticipating tomorrow's opportunities. 84. By enhancing strategic focus, operational agility, and collaborative approaches, UNDP aims to maximize contributions to human development and demonstrate the enduring value of multilateral cooperation in creating a more peaceful, just and sustainable world.",
        "Telecommunication/ Information and Communications Technology Indicators Symposium in Geneva on 23 and 24 September 2024 on the theme \u201cMetrics to action: bridging data gaps for universal and meaningful connectivity\u201d; 60. Recognizes the work of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations to promote digital inclusion and data and digital infrastructure in Africa and other regions to support poverty reduction, agricultural productivity and food security; 61. Also recognizes the work of the International Labour Organization on the impact on jobs caused by technological change, in particular the impact on women and persons in vulnerable situations; 62. Further recognizes the work of the Global Observatory for eHealth of the World Health Organization, including its consideration of how m-health, telehealth, electronic health records and e-learning can contribute to the goals of universal health coverage; 63. Recognizes the work of the United Nations Development Programme, including the publication of its Digital Strategy, which is aimed at applying the potential of digital technology to support the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, and reiterates the importance of the United Nations Development Programme continuing to focus on such assistance and digital capacity development for countries, in particular developing countries, in collaboration with other relevant United Nations agencies; 64. Also recognizes the work of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, including its publication of the Digital Initiatives for Indigenous Languages toolkit, which illustrates how Internet and other digital tools can be utilized to conserve, revive and promote Indigenous languages, as well as other minority languages; 65. Further recognizes the work of the Internet Governance Forum, including the development of its youth, national and regional initiatives, that support multi- stakeholder discussions on digital public policy; 66. Recalls the publication of the Secretary-General\u2019s strategy on new technologies on how the United Nations system will support the use of new technologies to accelerate the achievement of the 2030 Agenda and to facilitate their alignment with the values enshrined in the Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the norms and standards of international law; 67. Reiterates the commitment to harnessing the potential of information and communications technologies to achieve the 2030 Agenda and other internationally agreed development goals, noting that they can accelerate progress across all 17 Sustainable Development Goals, accordingly urges all Governments, the private sector, civil society, international organizations, the technical and academic communities and all other relevant stakeholders to integrate information and communications technologies into their approaches to implementing the Goals, and requests United Nations system entities facilitating the World Summit action lines to review their reporting and workplans to support the implementation of the 2030 Agenda; E/2025/31 E/CN.16/2025/4 14/39 25-07772 68. Notes with great concern the persistence of the gender digital divide on a global level \u2013 as 65 per cent of women and girls are now using the Internet compared with 70 per cent of men \u2013 and that women remain digitally marginalized in many of the world\u2019s poorest countries, draws attention to the gender digital divide, which persists in women\u2019s and girls\u2019 access to and use of information and communications technologies, including in education, employment and other areas of economic and social development, and, in line with Sustainable Development Goal 5 on achieving gender equality and empowering all women and girls, calls upon Member States and other stakeholders, as appropriate, to adopt all needed measures, especially by significantly enhancing women\u2019s and girls\u2019 education, as well as their participation in information and communications technologies, as users, content creators, employees, entrepreneurs, innovators and leaders, and by addressing technology-facilitated gender-based violence; 69. Notes the many initiatives targeted at closing the gender digital divide, including, among others, International Girls in ICT Day (International Telecommunication Union), the Global Partnership for Gender Equality in the Digital Age (the EQUALS initiative), the EQUALS in Tech Awards (International Telecommunication Union and United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women), the eTrade for Women Network (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development), Gender-Sensitive Indicators for Media (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), Women on the Homepage (United Nations Educational, Scient",

Information and communications technology 118. ICT governance framework. ICT governance is essential for the functioning of UNEP, since the organization operates in various locations and supports secretariats of the multilateral environmental agreements which may have developed their own ICT infrastructure and solutions. Globally, ICT policies of the United Nations Secretariat apply to UNEP, including the 2016 guidelines for the information and communications technology strategy. 93 Internally, a data and digital governance framework, which was endorsed by the senior management team in November 2023, structured the ICT governance framework into two workstreams: (a) the ICT Solutions Group chaired by the Chief of the Enterprise Solutions Section (Corporate Services Division); and (b) the Data and Product Group chaired by the Chief Digital Officer, who reports to the Executive Director. In 2023, the terms of reference of the ICT Solutions Group (taking over the functions of the former ICT committee) stated its responsibilities as identifying and prioritizing the organization-wide implementation of cost-efficient solutions and presenting recommendations to the senior management team to support data and digital governance. The review found that it was unclear whether the ICT Solutions Group was recommending or approving projects for digital products, as that point had not been sufficiently elaborated in its terms of reference. Regarding the Data and Product Group, on the basis of its terms of reference approved in 2025, the Group oversees the organization\u2019s digital transformation agenda, in alignment with the Data Strategy for Action by Everyone, Everywhere (2020).94 119. Integration of two workstreams. The Enterprise Solutions Section positions itself as a provider of software and systems solutions for internal and external use, such as web-based platforms, websites, applications and dashboard development, to assist UNEP units in the implementation of their activities. 95 The Inspector was __________________ 92 Report of the Chair of the Publications Committee, June 2023 (internal document). 93 A/69/517 and General Assembly resolution 69/262. 94 Data Strategy of the Secretary-General for Action by Everyone, Everywhere: With Insight, Impact and Integrity (2020). 95 For example, the weCollaborate website, the wedocs website, the travel portal, the concept approval group portal, the publications system, the open data portal, the Partner Portal, the JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 60 25-10420 informed that the capacity of the Section was affected by difficulties in recruiting for Professional positions and retaining international staff with the necessary ICT skills and experience. Consequently, the Section faced the risk of relying on short-term staff, consultants, individual contractors and national or international United Nations Volunteers (representing more than 60 per cent of the workforce of the Section in October 2024). This enables software development but does not ensure the institutional memory and knowledge required for the long-term maintenance of the applications. The Chief Digital Officer leads the digital transformations subprogramme, which is integrated into the medium-term strategy for 2022\u20132025 and has mostly an outward reach, seeking engagement with external stakeholders for digital products and outputs produced by the organization. Currently, the coordination between the digital transformations subprogramme and the work of the Enterprise Solutions Section is primarily at the working level. A reinforced coordination at a higher level is expected through the revised reporting line of the Chief of the Section to the Chief Digital Officer (dual reporting, in addition to the reporting to the Deputy Director of the Corporate Services Division). 120. ICT infrastructure and services. The United Nations Secretariat in New York is responsible for the provision of most of the ICT infrastructure, such as data servers and cloud hosting. Some of the basic services (Internet access, email system, telephone services, servers, Umoja access, service desk, etc.) are provided by UNON.",

        "ning accounts of ambitions for impact is structured around UNOPS missions. II. Global context Progress on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is off track 4. In 2024, progress towards the 2030 Agenda remained off track. Only 17 per cent of the Goals targets are on track; nearly half are showing minimal or moderate progress; and progress on over one third has stalled or regressed.3 Climate change affects those most vulnerable 5. Global greenhouse gas emissions set a new record in 2023.4People living in situations of fragility, conflict and violence are especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change. It is estimated that, by 2030, nearly 60 per cent of the world\u2019s extreme poor will live in fragile countries affected by conflict and violence.5 The global economy exacerbates inequalities 6. The global economic outlook improved in 2024, but was marked by uncertainty and uneven distribution.6 The annual financing gap for developing countries reached about $4 trillion.7 Pact for the future to accelerate implementation of the 2030 Agenda 7. In September 2024, heads and state of government committed to 56 actions to ensure the future we want and to effectively respond to current and future challenges, in partnership with all relevant stakeholders8. The repositioned development system 8. Through the quadrennial comprehensive policy review, the General Assembly establishes key system-wide strategic policy orientations and operational modalities for the development cooperation and country-level modalities of the United Nations development system. 9. The 2024 review reiterated the call on the United Nations development system to seek comparative advantages based on mandates, and to mainstream key decisions into their strategic plans. These include mainstreaming the Sustainable Development Goals, disability inclusion, climate- and environment-responsive approaches, the Doha Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries (resolution 76/258), the Antigua and Barbuda agenda for small island developing States (resolution 78/317), the Gaborone programme of action for landlocked developing countries for the decade 2024-2034 (resolution 79/233), South-South and triangular cooperation, and the special needs of middle-income countries.9 1 Decision 2022/13 2 Decisions 2021/20 and 2023/16 3 Sustainable Development Goals Report, 2024 4 UNEP Emissions Gap Report, 2024 5 Fragility, Conflict and Violence 6 World Economic Situation and Prospects as of mid-2024 7 Financing for Sustainable Development Report, 2024 8 Summit of the Future outcome document 9 A/C.2/79/L.60 DP/OPS/2025/6 5 III. Ambition for impact A. Contributing to impact through projects while harnessing capacity for missions 10. In 2024, UNOPS implemented more than 1,100 projects across over 130 countries10 for a value of about $2.7 billion: 83 per cent for development activities, 11 per cent humanitarian, and 6 per cent peace and security. 11. UNOPS assigns projects to the main Goal to which they are expected to contribute. In 2024, two Goals accounted for about half of UNOPS activities: Goal 3, \u2018good health and well-being\u2019 (37 per cent); and Goal 16, \u2018peace, justice and strong institutions\u2019 (14 per cent). 12. In 2023, the UNOPS Executive Director initiated a process to harness knowledge and capacity through eight missions. These are internal communities and networks intended to foster collaboration; they are not an expression of external programmatic intent. 13. The missions can be summarized in three groups. The following paragraphs illustrate the challenges and examples of the solutions UNOPS has implemented. Accelerate sustainable development 14. Triple planetary crisis. The crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution is an existential threat. Currently 3.6 billion people live in areas highly susceptible to climate change, and 21.5 million are displaced each year by climate-change related disasters. 15. Energy transition. By 2030, an estimated 660 million people will lack electricity access and around 1.8 billion will go without clean cooking fuels and technologies. (The energy sector is responsible for 73 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions.) 16. Just digital transformation. Approximately 2.6 billion people remain off-line, and only 50 per cent of the rural population use the internet (compared to 81 per cent of the urban population). 17. Food system transformation. An estimated 28.9 percent of the global population \u2013 2.33 billion people \u2013 were moderately or severely food insecure in 2023. Practical solutions accelerating sustainable development.
