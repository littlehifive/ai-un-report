However, their rapid and widespread diffusion is often outpacing the ability of many Governments to respond. The Technology and Innovation Report 2025: Inclusive Artificial Intelligence for Development surveys the complex artificial intelligence landscape, aiming to help decision makers design science, technology and innovation policies that foster inclusive technological progress. The use of artificial intelligence has the potential to accelerate progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, but if unevenly distributed and not guided by ethical oversight and transparency, its diffusion can exacerbate existing inequalities. The report analyses the requirements and policies needed at all stages, from development to adoption, to foster inclusive technological progress for sustainable development. This requires a multidimensional and evidence-based approach. For this purpose, three key leverage points \u2013 infrastructure, data and skills \u2013 are identified, offering a broad socioeconomic perspective and highlighting the need to build resilient infrastructure and promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and innovation. Technology and Innovation Report 2025 Inclusive Artificial Intelligence for Development Overview v The report starts by documenting the significant concentration in artificial intelligence development in a few companies and countries and identifies extensive gaps in digital infrastructure that risk widening inequalities both within and among countries. Then it explores productivity and workforce dynamics focusing on economic growth and decent work. From a national perspective, the report analyses the requirements and policies needed to support adoption, adaptation and development of artificial intelligence. From an international perspective, it considers the need for global artificial intelligence governance to steer artificial intelligence towards inclusive and equitable development, emphasizing the importance of international collaboration. History has shown that while technological progress drives economic growth, it does not on its own ensure equitable income distribution or promote inclusive human development. Stronger international cooperation can shift the focus from technology to people, enabling countries to co-create a global artificial intelligence framework. Such a framework should prioritize shared prosperity, create public goods and place humanity at the heart of artificial intelligence development.

      "question": "What are the main peacekeeping challenges mentioned in recent Security Council reports?",
      "answer": "Recent Security Council reports highlight several significant challenges facing peacekeeping operations, particularly in the context of evolving conflict dynamics and the operational environment. Here are some key challenges identified:\n\n1. **Fragmentation of Armed Groups**: Reports indicate that armed groups are increasingly fragmented, with internal divisions complicating peacekeeping efforts. For instance, in the Central African Republic, the Coalition des patriotes pour le changement (CPC) has split into factions, which continues to undermine stability and complicate the peace process [2]. This fragmentation makes it difficult for peacekeeping forces to engage effectively with local actors and maintain security.\n\n2. **Compliance with International Humanitarian Law**: There is a growing emphasis on ensuring that UN sanctions are implemented in full compliance with international humanitarian law. The challenge lies in balancing the enforcement of sanctions with the need for humanitarian access. Reports have noted that financial institutions and other actors may overcomply with sanctions, inadvertently hindering humanitarian efforts [1]. This highlights the need for better awareness and understanding of humanitarian exemptions within sanctions regimes.\n\n3. **Lack of Independent Monitoring Mechanisms**: The termination of panels of experts, such as the one for the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, has raised concerns about the absence of independent monitoring mechanisms for sanctions. Without these panels, there is a risk that sanctions may not be effectively enforced or monitored, leading to gaps in accountability and compliance [1].\n\n4. **Complex Security Environments**: The reports also describe how armed groups are adapting their strategies in response to changing political and security landscapes. For example, in the Central African Republic, armed groups have shifted their financing mechanisms and tactics, including the increased use of improvised explosive devices, which pose significant challenges for peacekeeping operations [2]. The evolving nature of these threats requires peacekeeping missions to be agile and responsive.\n\n5. **Humanitarian Crises and Displacement**: The humanitarian situation in conflict-affected areas remains dire, with a significant portion of the population in need of assistance. For instance, in the Central African Republic, nearly half of the population requires humanitarian aid, complicating the peacekeeping mandate and necessitating coordination with humanitarian actors [2]. The influx of refugees from neighboring conflicts, such as the situation in Sudan, further strains resources and complicates peacekeeping efforts.\n\n6. **Political Will and Cooperation**: The effectiveness of peacekeeping operations often hinges on the political will of member states and local actors. Reports indicate that cooperation with local governments and stakeholders is crucial for the success of peacekeeping missions, yet this cooperation can be inconsistent [4]. \n\nThese challenges underscore the complexity of modern peacekeeping operations and the need for adaptive strategies that consider the multifaceted nature of conflicts today. Addressing these issues requires a concerted effort from the international community to enhance the effectiveness of peacekeeping missions while ensuring compliance with humanitarian principles. \n\nIf you have specific areas of interest or further questions about peacekeeping operations, feel free to ask!",

        "w was expressed that United Nations sanctions were to be implemented in full compliance with international humanitarian law, and the adoption of Security Council resolution 2761 (2024) was noted with appreciation. The Secretariat was asked about the impact of the humanitarian carveout to United Nations sanctions regimes, implementation challenges, and potential solutions. The representative of the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs explained that sanctions committees were required to adopt Implementation Assistance Notices and underscored the need to increase awareness of the standing humanitarian exemption. In relation to challenges to implementation, a possible risk of overcompliance by financial institutions and other actors was noted, but the representative explained that the Emergency Relief Coordinator had observed that there had been a reduction in some delays that humanitarian actors faced to deliver or carry out their activities. 18. In the context of the termination of the mandate of the Panel of Experts for the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1718 (2006), the Secretariat was asked about the implementation challenges in connection with regimes with and without panels of experts and whether any specific challenges had emerged regarding the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea sanctions regime since the Panel\u2019s termination. The representative of the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs explained that sanctions committees were mandated by the Council to monitor the implementation of sanctions, and she noted that, where there was no panel of experts, the regimes lacked an independent monitoring mechanism. It was also noted that panels were often contacted for clarification regarding the implementation of sanction regimes.",

The report was provided to the Security Council Committee pursuant to resolution 2745 (2024) on 26 December 2024 and was considered by the Committee on 11 June 2025. The Panel of Experts would appreciate it if the present letter and the midterm report were brought to the attention of the members of the Security Council and issued as a document of the Council. (Signed) Mariam Yazdani Coordinator Panel of Experts pursuant to resolution 2745 (2024) (Signed) Fadhel Bouzidi Expert (Signed) Hanna Mollan Expert (Signed) Mohamed Mamadou Diatta Expert (Signed) Fiona Mangan Expert S/2025/384 24-24567 2/74 Midterm report of the Panel of Experts pursuant to resolution 2745 (2024) Summary Armed group dynamics have continued to evolve and adapt in response to shifting political and security realities at the local, national and regional level. The main alliance of armed groups, the Coalition des patriotes pour le changement (CPC), has faced significant internal divisions, culminating in a split in August 2024, and the formation of the Coalition des patriotes pour le changement Fondamentale (CPC-F), led by the Unit\u00e9 pour la paix en Centrafrique (UPC) leader and sanctioned individual, Ali Darassa, (CFi.015). Despite tensions at the leadership level, both factions continue to coordinate their operations on the ground. Furthermore, the emergence of new armed groups, including the Coalition militaire de salut du peuple et de redressement (CMSPR), has added complexity to the security situation. These developments highlight the ongoing fragmentation of the peace process and the persistence of armed rebellion, which remain significant threats to peace and stability in the country and the wider region. Shifting armed group financing mechanisms reflect evolving local and regional changes in the political and security context. In response, armed groups have deepened their regional reach, with potential implications for their future. Since 2021, military operations and the extension of State authority have increasingly reduced the hold of armed groups over key gold and diamond mining areas and impacted their ability to tax local herders. Consequently, armed groups in western Central African Republic have become more covert in their activities, which they confined to conducting sporadic attacks. By contrast, in eastern Central African Republic, the role of armed group leaders in coordinating and leasing their fighters as mercenaries for the ongoing conflict in the Sudan has intensified, becoming a source of funding and support. During the reporting period, the Central African Republic has taken steps to address cross-border criminal activities and to regulate the natural resources trade. For instance, a new mining code was promulgated in August 2024. The General Inspectorate for Mines, alongside the Special Anti-Fraud Unit (Unit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale anti-fraude \u2013 USAF), has expanded its operations to address mining fraud. Progress has also been achieved in the implementation of the country\u2019s new border policy. In analysing illicit arms trafficking in the Central African Republic, the Panel observes that networks facilitating arms transfers remain active and could rapidly expand should external financial or material support be injected into the region, although financing for armed groups has temporarily reduced current capacity to resupply. One significant shift in tactics is the increased use of improvised explosive devices. The humanitarian situation remains challenging, with 46 per cent of the population needing assistance and protection. The moderate but continued influx of refugees from the conflict in the Sudan continued. By mid-December, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) had registered 36,591 Sudanese refugees across six prefectures in the Central African Republic.

Introduction 1. In paragraph 2 of its resolution 2725 (2024), the Security Council requested the Panel of Experts on the Sudan to provide to the Council, after discussion with the Committee, a final report by 13 January 2025 with its findings and recommendations. In the present report, the Panel outlines its findings. 2. The Panel visited Port Sudan in November 2024. It held meetings with members of the Darfurian armed movements signatories to the Juba Peace Agreement, General Ibrahim Gabir \u2013\u2060 a member of the Transitional Sovereign Council, as well as members of the General Intelligence Service, the Humanitarian Aid Commission, the Military Intelligence Service, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of the Interior, the National Coordination Mechanism,1 the Peace Commission and the Unit to Combat Violence Against Children and Women. The Panel wishes to express its appreciation to the Government of the Sudan for the support it received during the reporting period and its visit to Port Sudan. 3. In addition, the Panel held meetings and conducted telephone interviews with a number of interlocutors, including members of the Government of the Sudan, the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the Darfurian armed movements, both signatories and non-signatories to the Juba Peace Agreement, as well as representatives of civil society, including internally displaced persons, refugees, victims and eyewitnesses of violence, women\u2019s organizations and members of local communities. It also met with representatives from United Nations agencies and programmes and the diplomatic community. During its mandate, the Panel conducted visits to Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda and the United Arab Emirates. Unfortunately, despite official correspondence and engagements in New York with the Permanent Mission of Chad to the United Nations, Chad did not respond to the Panel\u2019s request to visit the border areas with Darfur. 4. The Panel worked in full conformity with the best practices and methods recommended by the Security Council Informal Working Group on General Issues of Sanctions (see S/2006/997) (see annex 1). II. Conflict dynamics A. Fragmentation and proliferation of armed actors and their war strategies 5. The fragmentation and proliferation of armed actors, as well as the overlap of military and civilian spaces, shaped the dynamics of violence. This led to widespread displacement and violations of international humanitarian law. 1. SAF and the SAF-aligned joint forces 6. In 2024, the conflict in Darfur was defined by contrasting military strategies as SAF, RSF and SAF-aligned joint forces2 vied to secure and consolidate control in the region. SAF, with a limited physical presence \u2013 primarily a small contingent stationed in El Fasher \u2013 relied heavily on SAF-aligned joint forces and allied militias to conduct __________________ 1 The mechanism that facilitated the Panel\u2019s visit to Port Sudan. 2 A force comprising members of a number of signatory groups to the Juba Peace Agreement, including the Sudan Liberation Army-Minni Minawi (SLA/MM), the Justice and Equality Movement-Gibril Ibrahim (JEM), the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army Transitional Council- Osman Abdul Jabar (SLA/TC/Osman Abdul Jabar faction) and the Sudan Liberation Forces- Abdallah Janna (GSLF-Janna faction).

      "question": "How do Commission on the Status of Women reports address economic empowerment?",
      "answer": "The reports from the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) and related UN documents highlight several key aspects of economic empowerment for women, emphasizing its critical role in achieving gender equality and sustainable development.\n\n1. **Economic Participation and Leadership**: The draft ministerial declaration from the high-level segment of the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) underscores the commitment to ensuring equal economic participation and leadership for women. It emphasizes the need to promote women's access to entrepreneurship, financial inclusion, and decent work. This includes addressing the unequal distribution of unpaid care work, which often limits women's economic opportunities, and ensuring that women have ownership and control over land and resources [3].\n\n2. **Supportive Policies and Frameworks**: The report from the Under-Secretary-General/Executive Director of UN-Women outlines various pathways to change discriminatory social norms that hinder women's economic empowerment. For instance, UN-Women has facilitated dialogues in communities to challenge norms around women's paid employment and men's involvement in unpaid care work. This approach is crucial for creating an environment where women can thrive economically [2].\n\n3. **Investment in Care Economy**: The draft declaration also highlights the importance of investing in care and support systems as a means to lift women out of poverty. It recognizes that social and financial institutions play a vital role in this process, advocating for increased investment in the care economy to support women's economic empowerment [3].\n\n4. **Partnerships and Funding**: The reports indicate that UN-Women has made significant strides in engaging with governments and the private sector to create business environments conducive to women's empowerment. For example, in Nigeria, a $25 million fund was established to combat gender-based violence, supported by private companies and international financial institutions. Such partnerships are essential for expanding market access and resources for women entrepreneurs [2].\n\n5. **Challenges and Progress**: While there has been progress, challenges remain. The reports indicate that gender inequalities in land rights persist, with men owning significantly more land than women in many countries. However, initiatives in places like Tanzania show promise, where dedicated budgets for land use plans are being implemented to secure women's land ownership [2].\n\nIn summary, the CSW reports and related documents emphasize a multifaceted approach to economic empowerment, focusing on policy reform, community engagement, investment in care systems, and partnerships with the private sector. These efforts are crucial for dismantling the barriers that women face in achieving economic equality and ensuring their full participation in the economy.",

        "e 3: Positive social norms, including through engaging men and boys 38. Discriminatory social norms remain a stubborn and major barrier to gender equality. In 2024, UN-Women made significant progress in advancing global knowledge on social norms change, including through developing a framework for addressing discriminatory social norms on gender equality in diverse contexts. Driven by an intersectional, feminist approach emphasizing the role of social institutions \u2013 the state, market, family and community \u2013 in sustaining social norms, the framework will strengthen UN-Women\u2019s work and inform the next Strategic Plan. 39. In 23 countries, UN-Women supported 101 programmes at the community and organizational levels in pursuing three pathways to change discriminatory social norms. 90% >= 90% Progress >= 60% Progress 0-59% Progress Figure 4: Progress towards 2024 milestones UNW/2025/2 25-05955 12/25 40. First, UN-Women facilitated dialogues and reflections within communities and organizations to encourage the questioning of discriminatory norms and the narratives that justify them. In Egypt, Jordan and Morocco, communities, private and public sector organizations were mobilized to challenge discriminatory norms around women\u2019s paid employment and men\u2019s involvement in unpaid care work. 41. Second, UN-Women supported advocacy to end discriminatory norms, strengthening women\u2019s rights movements and allyship, and creating a critical mass demanding change. In the Pacific, UN-Women bolstered coalitions of 13 national and international sports entities to eliminate discriminatory norms. Subsequently, the governing body for rugby in Samoa adopted a \u201czero-violence policy\u201d prohibiting all forms of gender-based discrimination by staff, management, coaches and referees. 42. Third, UN-Women created material conditions for changing discriminatory norms by facilitating legal and organizational policy reforms. As a result, 22 countries developed comprehensive national and subnational strategies to prevent violence against women based on uprooting the discriminatory norms that justify violence. In the United Republic of Tanzania, UN-Women joined other United Nations entities to support the promulgation of the National Clean Cooking Strategy, which recognizes the state\u2019s role in reducing unpaid care work and challenges the normalization of caregiving as women\u2019s responsibility alone. UN-Women continued fostering gender-inclusive workplace cultures in a range of countries. In Georgia, six government agencies rolled out sexual harassment prevention and response policies and mechanisms. In China, UN-Women strengthened the capacities of 10 national, provincial and local partners across diverse industries \u2013 including textiles, apparel and electronics \u2013 to address discriminatory workplace norms. Private sector engagement In 2024, UN-Women made significant strides in engaging with governments and the private sector to promote business environments that work for women. It worked with 11 governments in five regions to strengthen gender-responsive legislation, policies and regulations that uphold private sector accountability, including through the Women\u2019s Empowerment Principles. Strategic partnerships with the private sector resulted in substantial corporate investments in gender equality, with positive impacts on communities. In Nigeria, UN-Women established a $25 million fund to combat gender-based violence with robust support from private companies and international financial institutions. Private sector support to the Women\u2019s Entrepreneurship Expo expanded market access, financing and networks for over 5,000 women entrepreneurs across 20 countries in Europe and Central Asia. A pioneering partnership between UN-Women and the advertising industry through the Unstereotype Alliance aligned 240 organizations with $100.17 billion in global advertising expenditure promoting progressive social norms. Its landmark \u201cinclusion=income\u201d research irrefutably demonstrated that inclusive advertising drives sales and garnered media prominence. UNW/2025/2 13/25 25-05955 H. Outcome 4: Women\u2019s equitable access to services, goods and resources 43. UN-Women deepened investments in women\u2019s equitable access to services, goods and resources essential for livelihoods and well-being, although progress has been mixed. Gender inequalities in land rights demonstrate women\u2019s disparate access to resources, with men\u2019s land ownership at least twice that of women in countries with data. With the support of UN-Women and other partners, the United Republic of Tanzania has dedicated budgets for village land use plans to secure women\u2019s land ownership; 611 certificates on customary rights of occupancy were issued in just one district. 44.",

We acknowledge the mutually reinforcing links between the achievement of gender equality, the empowerment of all women and girls and the eradication of poverty. We emphasize the importance of support for countries in their efforts to eradicate poverty. We recognize the role of social and financial institutions in lifting women and girls out of poverty, and also recognize that countries, who bear the main responsibility for social integration and social inclusion, should invest in care and support systems and, in this regard, we commit to increasing investment in the economy, including the care economy, as well as strengthening social and financial inclusion and economic empowerment. 58. We commit to ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights as agreed in accordance with the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development 19 and the Beijing Platform for Action and the outcome documents of their review conferences. 59. We acknowledge women\u2019s and girls\u2019 critical contributions to their families and communities. We recognize the importance of implementing family-friendly and family-oriented policies aimed at, inter alia, achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls and their enjoyment of all human rights and also recognize the need to ensure that all sustainable development policies and programmes are responsive to the changing needs and expectations of families in fulfilling their numerous functions and that the rights, capabilities and responsibilities of all family members are respected. We also recognize the importance of fully engaging men and boys as agents and beneficiaries of change and as strategic partners and allies in the achievement of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls. 60. We commit to ensuring equal economic participation and leadership to promote and protect women\u2019s rights, foster gender equality, improve the lives and well-being of women, and accelerate achievement of other development outcomes. We will promote women\u2019s access to entrepreneurship, capacity-building, financial inclusion and financial literacy by ensuring access to credit, financial resources and markets, access to ownership and control over land and other forms of property and inheritance, improving social protection systems and public services, addressing unequal distribution of unpaid care and domestic work, and facilitating women\u2019s full and equal participation in the labour market, and equal access of women to decent work and quality jobs in all sectors and at all levels, including through bridging the gender digital divide, digital inclusion and entrepreneurship by promoting, respecting, protecting and fulfilling women\u2019s rights to work and rights at work, including the right to organize and bargain collectively and promoting equal pay for work of equal value. 61. We reaffirm our commitment to end all forms of discrimination against all women and girls everywhere.

We reiterate the urgency of addressing existing structural barriers such as discriminatory laws and policies, gender stereotypes, harmful practices and negative social norms and attitudes, so as to ensure the protection, respect and fulfilment of women\u2019s and girls\u2019 human rights, as well as their access to ownership and control over land and other forms of property, inheritance and other resources, and access to credit, financial resources and services. We urge that countries fully integrate gender equality strategies into national sustainable development frameworks so as to promote accelerated action and greater policy coherence, recognizing that achieving gender equality will require both targeted gender-responsive action and the systemic mainstreaming of a gender perspective into all our policies and programmes. 62.

Speakers expressed their support for the inclusive and consultative approach of the development of UN-Women\u2019s 2026\u20132029 Strategic Plan and encouraged the new plan to be focused, ambitious and responsive to realities on the ground. Member States welcomed the UN80 initiative aimed at building a more effective and efficient United Nations, though delegations stressed that gender equality should remain at the heart of this transformation, and encouraged UN- Women to contribute constructively to an ambitious reform proposal and to help ensure that women\u2019s rights and gender equality are well safeguarded in this reform process. While expressing appreciation and acknowledging the importance of UN- Women\u2019s efforts to advance gender equality and the empowerment of women, one speaker emphasized that support to Member States should be provided with their consent and called on UN-Women to strictly adhere to its mandate and to use intergovernmentally agreed language. III. Evaluation 8. The Director of the Independent Evaluation, Audit and Investigation Services (IEAIS) presented the annual report on the evaluation function of UN-Women (UNW/2025/4). The report provides an overview of the performance of the UN- Women evaluation function in 2024. In total, the Independent Evaluation Service (IES) completed three corporate evaluations in the areas of women's political participation and social norms, a synthesis of United Nations system-wide evaluations related to SDG 5 and a formative assessment of the gender equality accelerators. Additionally, three corporate evaluations were in progress (on ending violence against women, sustainable finance and support to women in peace processes), as well as a synthesis of UN-Women\u2019s performance against the Strategic Plan. Fifty evaluations were conducted or in progress at the decentralized level, including 18 strategic evaluations at the country and regional levels, with six of those portfolio evaluations completed. In 2024, corporate evaluation performance indicators remained rated UNW/2025/6 25-12751 4/22 \u201cgood\u201d; however, financial expenditure on evaluation was 1.6 per cent of the total programme expenditure, falling short of the 2 per cent target. Human resources across UN-Women for evaluation and evaluation implementation rates both increased in 2024. Engagement in joint evaluations also increased, accounting for 35 per cent of all evaluations. In terms of evaluation coverage, all but three country offices had at least one evaluation during their strategic note cycles. The Director of IEAIS reported that implementation of management responses fell slightly to 86 per cent following the introduction of a more rigorous monitoring and tracking system. She added that the use of evaluation remains strong, with 90 per cent of offices reporting the use of evaluation to inform strategic planning, strengthen programme approaches and identify new opportunities. She also outlined the IES\u2019 many partnerships, including its engagement in inter-agency humanitarian evaluations and United Nations system- wide evaluations and initiatives to ensure that evaluations incorporate gender equality. The Director concluded by saying that the IES will continue to conduct corporate strategic evaluations, provide technical assistance to decentralized evaluations and build evaluation partnerships in the United Nations system. 9. The Director of IEAIS presented the corporate evaluation on UN-Women's support to women\u2019s participation in the peace process (UNW/2025/CRP.3). The evaluation concluded that since the adoption of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and Security Council resolution 1325, UN-Women has made meaningful contributions to the inclusion of women in the peace process through five core methods: (1) by convening stakeholders; (2) by raising awareness and supporting political commitments; (3) through supporting civil society; (4) by embedding gender equality in institutional frameworks; and (5) through enhancing partnerships. The evaluation found that politically skilled personnel, senior representatives, presence in country, deep contextual knowledge and enabling corporate procedures are critical drivers to deliver and recommended that UN-Women reinforce these areas. 10. Speaking on behalf of management, the Deputy Executive Director expressed appreciation for the IES\u2019 work, highlighting the benefits that its work brings to UN- Women.",
        "nnual pay gap assessments and continuously monitoring gender parity in recruitment, promotion and retention. 54. Global and regional accountability mechanisms, such as the Gender Equality Steering Committee, help to provide guidance to UNICEF country offices on implementation of the Gender Action Plan and ensure adherence to minimum standards. In 2024, some 109 country offices had appropriate management oversight to support gender equality results, and 70 country offices had clearly defined accountability mechanisms within their programme management plans. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, for example, UNICEF has activated a governance mechanism within the country office to oversee programme targets for gender equality and ensure sufficient resourcing of programme priorities and leadership accountability for gender equality across sectors and in the office. IV. The way forward 55. As this report highlights, UNICEF is reaching more girls and women with quality services and opportunities for empowerment than ever before. Strong and lasting partnerships with Governments, civil society and girls are driving progress in education, health and protection, while dedicated resources are being channelled to girls\u2019 and women\u2019s organizations on the front lines of change, particularly in humanitarian settings. Momentum is growing, with national Governments and private, public and philanthropic allies rallying behind programming that advances gender equality and the empowerment of girls and women. 56. Yet much remains to be done. As UNICEF looks ahead to its new Strategic Plan and Gender Action Plan, both for the period 2026\u20132029, it will be critical to preserve and scale up foundational investments in girls\u2019 and women\u2019s empowerment. Key priorities include the following: (a) Expanding health and nutrition initiatives for women and girls, while centring and supporting growing cohorts of female community front-line workers; (b) Scaling up proven solutions for girls\u2019 skills development and transition to meaningful employment, including targeted social protection measures to remove financial barriers to learning; (c) Sustaining UNICEF leadership and strong partnerships for gender equality within the United Nations system, ensuring continued high performance and progress in prioritizing gender equality withing country programmes and financing, and tracking and reporting on impact. E/ICEF/2025/20 17/17 25-07286 57. Systemic change is within reach \u2013 but only with concerted, determined action. At a time when global development assistance is shrinking and threats to the rights of girls and women are mounting, the world needs a clear, unwavering path to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls. UNICEF is committed to doing its part to help to lead that charge as a strong and vibrant partner. Because when girls and women rise, everyone thrives."

      "question": "What development priorities are highlighted in recent UNDP documents?",
      "answer": "Recent UNDP documents highlight several key development priorities that reflect the evolving landscape of global challenges and the need for innovative solutions. Here are some of the main themes and priorities identified:\n\n1. **Integration of Digital Technologies and AI**: The UNDP is emphasizing the importance of integrating digital technologies and artificial intelligence into development strategies. This includes understanding how these technologies can enhance development outcomes and addressing the complexities they introduce into existing systems. The upcoming Human Development Report will specifically focus on harnessing AI for human development, indicating a strategic pivot towards leveraging technology for better outcomes [1].\n\n2. **Resource Mobilization and Funding**: There is a strong call for donor countries to maintain their contributions while encouraging program countries to take a more proactive role in financing UNDP initiatives. Concerns about declining core funding are prevalent, with suggestions to rethink resource mobilization strategies and innovate funding approaches to ensure sustainability and effectiveness in program delivery [1][3].\n\n3. **Addressing Inequalities**: The UNDP is committed to tackling gender and racial inequalities, as well as enhancing capacity-building efforts. This aligns with broader UN goals to ensure that no one is left behind, particularly in the context of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The focus on ending inequalities is critical as the world grapples with the impacts of crises and the need for inclusive growth [1][4].\n\n4. **Climate Action and Environmental Sustainability**: The UNDP is leading initiatives like the Climate Promise and the Nature Pledge, which aim to enhance climate resilience and biodiversity. These efforts are crucial for countries facing environmental challenges, particularly in the context of the global climate crisis. The integration of climate and development goals is a priority, as seen in various programs aimed at promoting sustainable practices and reducing emissions [2].\n\n5. **Humanitarian-Development-Peace Nexus**: The UNDP is focusing on breaking the cycle of poverty and crisis through adaptive development strategies that strengthen resilience. This approach is particularly important in complex crises where traditional development indicators show stagnation or regression. The emphasis is on integrated programming that addresses humanitarian needs while fostering long-term development [2][3].\n\n6. **Support for Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Fragile States**: There is a clear recognition of the unique challenges faced by LDCs and small island developing states (SIDS). The UNDP is prioritizing support for these regions, advocating for increased funding and innovative financing mechanisms to help them achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. This includes addressing structural transformation and enhancing productive capacities [5].\n\nThese priorities reflect a comprehensive approach to development that seeks to adapt to changing global dynamics while remaining focused on the core mission of improving human well-being and fostering sustainable development. The UNDP's strategic planning and programming are increasingly responsive to the complexities of today's world, aiming to create resilient systems that can withstand future challenges.",

        "tions with international financial institutions, systematic integration of digital and artificial intelligence, and an emphasis on resilience-building for both current and future emergencies. They proposed sharpening thematic priorities and clarifying the UNDP narrative on its role in a rapidly changing development space. 67. On resources, delegations called for donor countries to uphold their contributions and for programme countries to take a more proactive role in financing UNDP initiatives within their borders. They expressed concern about resource limitations forcing the agency to work on a project basis. They suggested rethinking resource mobilization strategies, introducing innovations to secure the regular budget, and expanding the donor base. 68. On programming and partnerships, delegations commended efforts to close gaps across humanitarian, peace, and development action. They lauded support for complex transitions and welcomed integrated programming approaches. Delegates also called for increased attention to ending gender and racial inequality, and enhancing capacity-building and triangular cooperation. One delegation sought insights on UNDP support for the right to development. 69. In response to delegations, the Administrator affirmed the significance of UNDP investment in digital technologies. Regarding artificial intelligence, he underscored the need for tested models to understand how this technology will interface with development and shape future offers. The strategic planning preparation process has reaffirmed that UNDP support is most valued at the intersection of development issues, where it can help address the complexity of development systems. 70. He stated that the strategic plan would reflect the quadrennial comprehensive policy review, the Pact for the Future, outcomes from the extensive consultations, and decisions by the United Nations and the Executive Board. He highlighted priorities, including the revenue model and partnership processes, emphasizing that UNDP had diversified its funding and continued to do so. Due to potential disruptions in core funding, UNDP is implementing mitigation measures. At the same time, with improved monitoring, transparency, and a 30 per cent reduction in operational costs over the last decade, the discussion could advance toward a realistic approach to efficiency and effectiveness, including through comparisons with other multilateral and bilateral DP/2025/8 11 organizations. The Administrator noted that UNDP collaborates closely with United Nations entities. 71. He concluded by describing UNDP as a trusted platform for engaging in development decisions that matter both to individual countries and to the global community. UNDP is integral to the United Nations and serves as a unique source of value for the international community. IX. Human Development Report 72. The Director of the Human Development Report Office provided an update on the Human Development Report consultations, stating that the upcoming report is the second in a trilogy addressing global uncertainty. The report will focus on harnessing artificial intelligence for human development, following a report on polarization. The third report in the series will address planetary change. He noted wide uptake of the reports, with eight million page views on their website recorded in 2024. 73. Consultations for the forthcoming report have covered all five regions and engaged experts and leaders from industry, academia, trade, labour, human rights, and United Nations organizations, amongst others. 74. The Executive Board took note of the update on the Human Development Report. X. UNDP country programmes and related matters 75. The UNDP Associate Administrator presented an overview of the new UNDP country programme documents for Bahrain, Colombia, Iraq, Paraguay and Rwanda, and the extensions for the country programmes for Guatemala, Kuwait, Mali and the Republic of Sudan. 76. The regional directors for Africa, the Arab States, and Latin America and the Caribbean provided insights from their respective regions. 77. The Executive Board, in line with decision 2014/7, approved the UNDP country programme documents for Bahrain (DP/DCP/BHR/4), Colombia (DP/DCP/COL/4), Iraq (DP/DCP/IRQ/4), Paraguay (DP/DCP/PRY/4) and Rwanda (DP/DCP/RWA/4), ensuring alignment with national priorities and the UNDP Strategic Plan. 78. The Executive Board took note of the first one-year extension of the country programmes for Guatemala, Kuwait and Mali, and approved the fourth one-year extension of the country programme for the Republic of Sudan (DP/2025/5).

        "nd promote energy security. At the centre are people and their opportunities to thrive. 29. UNDP supported the Zambian National Green Growth Strategy, for example, to take an economy-wide approach to rural development, livelihoods, equality and climate. With Global Environment Facility (GEF) financing, it has introduced climate-resilient agriculture promoting food security for nearly a million farmers; over 60 per cent of them women. 30. UNDP leads the United Nations system-wide Climate Promise 2025. Eighty countries are working on a third generation of nationally determined contributions to raise emissions reductions targets and integrate climate development issues, such as land management. The UNDP-led Nature Pledge supports 133 countries with national biodiversity finance planning to restore ecosystems and reduce poverty. In 29 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, UNDP linked the Climate Promise and Nature Pledge to achieve both climate and biodiversity goals. Colombia, for instance, is restoring 5 million hectares of land to boost carbon sequestration and ecosystem resilience. 31. Systems approaches through UNDP portfolios help to identify paths to faster transitions, such as through a $50 million European Union and UNDP partnership on the green urban economy in 60 cities. An $800 million portfolio of programmes supports adaptation in 60 countries through better climate information and early warning systems. Somalia reached a milestone with its first National Hydro-Meteorological Service, which provides over 525,000 ago-pastoralists with early warnings on climate shocks such as droughts. Cuba increased hydrometeorological system coverage by 40 per cent, protecting 700,000 people against hurricanes and other extreme weather events. 32. UNDP links human resilience, environmental protections and innovations in finance. For example: \u2022 UNDP is the lead implementing partner for the Global Environment Signature solutions and enablers - Resilience - Environment - Energy - Gender equality - Poverty and inequality - Innovation SPOTLIGHT: Green transition - Largest United Nations provider of climate and environmental assistance: $5 billion for 145 countries - 14.3 million people in 84 countries benefited from protections for nature and resources - 315 million hectares of land protected - 41 countries with improved energy for essential services SPOTLIGHT: Finance and innovation - New era of biodiversity finance: $2.6 billion - Largest public and private finance mechanism for the ocean, at $225 million - New hub for vulnerable countries to finance adaptation DP/2025/12 10 Facility and Green Climate Fund, among the largest providers of nature and climate finance. \u2022 The Biodiversity Finance Initiative (BIOFIN) initiative, launched by the European Union and UNDP in 2012, has grown into a global endeavour, ushering in a new era of biodiversity finance, catalysing $1.6 billion since 2012 and freeing $1 billion more by repurposing harmful subsidies. \u2022 Over 20 small island developing States and other nations with coral reserves draw on the $225 million Global Fund for Coral Reefs, administered by the UNDP-hosted Multi-Partner Trust Fund Office. It is the largest public and private blended finance mechanism for the oceans, strengthening the resilience of coastal reef ecosystems, communities and economies. 33. The UNDP energy portfolio spans 392 initiatives across 131 countries, integrating technology, resilience and poverty reduction to harness energy for the green transition and multiple development goals. Equipping 107 social service facilities with solar power in Yemen, for example, has improved and sustained education, health care and water services for over 500,000 people. Since 2017, the Solar for Health initiative has deployed solar power systems to electrify nearly 1,000 health centres and medical cold-storage facilities across 15 countries. Jordan doubled its renewables share to 29 per cent from 2020-2024, drawing on integrated UNDP governance and energy support to streamline regulations. C. Crises are complex. How can development keep up? 34. UNDP helps break the cycle of poverty and crisis through adaptive development that strengthens resilience to crises and addresses the humanitarian-development-peace nexus. This anticipates and prevents multiple risks. It helps restart development so people are less prone to crisis and better positioned to flourish. In complex crises, where people are worse off on every indicator of multidimensional poverty, such integrated approaches are critical. 35. In crisis after crisis, through its early recovery approach, UNDP meets acute human security needs for services, safety and voice: \u2022 Lebanon: UNDP and national institutions provided energy, agriculture, water and public saf",

Additionally, the Administrator emphasized UNDP\u2019s continued role in hosting and providing core funding to system-wide entities, including the United Nations Volunteers (UNV) programme, the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF), and the United Nations Office for South-South Cooperation (UNOSSC). 63. The Administrator pointed to institutional performance gains, such as 19 consecutive unqualified audit opinions and consistent top rankings in the Aid Transparency Index. He reported increased programme efficiency, with 92 cents of every dollar now going directly to programming- up from 88 cents- and cited improved implementation of the United Nations System-Wide Action Plan on Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-SWAP) as indicators of disciplined, accountable institutional management. 64. Expressing concern over declining core resources, the Administrator cautioned that core funding could fall to below $450 million by 2026\u2014less than half the level recorded in the early 2010s. He described this trajectory as unsustainable, warning that it could undermine programme delivery, staffing, institutional resilience, and the integrity of UNDP systems. He urged Member States to consider the long-term implications of continued declines in core funding. 65. Looking forward, the Administrator introduced the draft Strategic Plan, 2026\u20132029, as a focused and integrated document shaped by consultations with over 11,000 stakeholders. He DP/2025/20 25-11430 11 reaffirmed the centrality of human development, emphasized systemic transformation, and highlighted strengthened risk management. The Plan draws on lessons from the past eight years to deliver results and impact in increasingly complex environments. 66. During the interactive dialogue, delegations expressed appreciation for the leadership of the Administrator and welcomed the cumulative review of the UNDP Strategic Plan, 2022-2025, and the Administrator\u2019s annual report for 2024. Delegations commended UNDP\u2019s performance and its role in the multilateral system during a challenging period. 67. Several delegations and regional groups expressed strong appreciation for the Administrator\u2019s leadership, acknowledging his efforts to reposition UNDP as an agile, forward-looking organization. They highlighted UNDP\u2019s contributions to development finance, innovation, climate action, support to elections and crises, and United Nations development system coherence. The Administrator was commended for efforts to improve organizational transparency, efficiency, and gender equality. 68. A number of delegations stressed the importance of predictable, flexible core resources. They noted the urgent need to reverse declining core funding trends, which could undermine programmatic delivery and continuity. Other delegations and regional groups emphasized the disproportionate impact of these trends on least developed countries, Small Island Developing States (SIDS), and countries in crisis or transition. Delegations reiterated their support for multilateralism and pledged continued collaboration with UNDP in implementing the Pact for the Future and strengthening coherence across the United Nations system. 69. On strategic planning, delegations welcomed the cumulative review and commended UNDP for maintaining focus on results. They urged the organization to maintain its emphasis on national ownership, country-level delivery, and alignment with national priorities. Delegations stressed the need for greater attention to countries in special situations, including middle-income countries, SIDS, and those affected by conflict. There was also strong support for South-South and triangular cooperation. 70. Member States broadly welcomed the draft Strategic Plan, 2026\u20132029, recognizing its ambition and responsiveness to current and emerging challenges. They emphasized the importance of maintaining a strategic focus on poverty eradication, gender equality, and leaving no one behind, while also underscoring the need for clear prioritization, adaptability in the face of funding constraints, and a well-defined articulation of UNDP\u2019s comparative advantage. 71. Member States emphasized the importance of innovation and digitalization, urging UNDP to deepen investments in digital public infrastructure, data systems, and technological innovations to accelerate the SDGs. Delegations requested more information on how UNDP integrates lessons learned into its programming and welcomed efforts to track performance through robust monitoring frameworks. 72.",
        "particularly, least developed countries. E/2025/33 12/28 25-04788 D. Convergence in human and social development 23. In the 2030 Agenda, eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, was named as the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development. The Pact for the Future reiterated this objective as an imperative for all humankind. However, 10 years after the adoption of the 2030 Agenda, the world is off track. The priority and urgency of eradicating poverty will be one of the three core themes at the upcoming Second World Summit for Social Development and is central to other global processes such as the Fourth International Conference on Financing for Development, the thirtieth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty. Ensuring that no one is left behind or pushed behind, a concept that has found widespread resonance since 2015, is critical moving forward. The current global context calls for breaking-the-mould approaches and pragmatic solutions, for which research and evidence are critical, as recognized in the choice of theme of the Economic and Social Council for 2025. 24. Convergence in development outcomes between and within countries has been at the centre of analytical work on development. With new challenges and changing development contexts, a sophisticated understanding of convergence is needed, one that includes multidimensional poverty measures, lessons from the efforts that have been made to \u201cleave no one behind\u201d, and a comprehensive concept of human development. There is a need to address both new and persistent inequalities to ensure inclusive and multidimensional convergence. Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita can no longer be the benchmark for success in development. 25. Convergence between least developed countries and other developing countries has been a focus of the work of the Committee since the inception of the least developed country category. Analysis of the development of countries based on the criteria that officially define the category shows that least developed countries have made progress and even achieved some degree of convergence on social indicators, such as reducing child and maternal mortality and achieving gender parity in school completion. However, convergence overall has been limited, particularly in economic and environmental indicators. Beyond the official indicators, least developed countries showed faster improvements in some areas, such as electricity access and immunization rates, but lagged in others, such as Internet access, disaster resilience and refugee displacement. Over time, there have been notable shifts in global convergence trends. Periods of regression, such as in the 1970s and 1980s, were followed by periods of greater convergence, such as from 2005 to 2015, but in the more recent period progress has stagnated on several dimensions. Likewise, the human development index scores for least developed countries suffered a reversal after the pandemic. It is not yet clear whether the recent stagnation and reversals will be short-lived or are indicative of a longer-term challenge. However, recent trends demonstrate that any convergence is vulnerable to shocks of multiple natures, which are expected to become more frequent and more severe, requiring the incorporation of resilience-building and disaster risk reduction in convergence strategies. 26. One of the factors behind the insufficient convergence is the meagre progress on structural transformation. Many least developed countries have become more commodity dependent over time, with deep implications for inclusive growth, employment, and poverty eradication. A number of other factors have affected recent advances, including recurrent crises, a persistent digital divide, rising living costs, development finance constraints including the burden of external debt, and political instability. Conflict, insecurity and displacement have also significantly stunted convergence. The new context presents new challenges: for example, artificial E/2025/33 25-04788 13/28 intelligence can present significant challenges for countries and people who are not equipped to take advantage of its potential and instead are vulnerable to the labour and other disruptions that it creates. In a context of ecological crisis, while convergence and structural transformation remain goals, new pathways towards those goals need to be explored, for example through new technologies and new value chains, which in turn requires countries to invest in productive capacities, including innovation and technological capacities. 27.",

It examines progress in three outcome areas: (a) accelerated, inclusive, diversified, green economic transformation; (b) increased flows of public and private finance; and (c) strengthened market systems and public and private financing mechanisms. An analysis of UNCDF institutional effectiveness and key evaluation findings is also presented. Elements of a decision The Executive Board may wish to: (a) take note of the report; (b) commend progress made by UNCDF in 2024 through its organizational restructure to align closer to its original mandate (United Nations General Assembly resolution 2186) and (c) encourage UNCDF to strengthen its role as a financing enabler and de-risker for the United Nations development system to help to unlock more resources in support of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in countries in special situations, especially least developed countries.

Least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing States (SIDS), and conflict-affected and fragile countries stand at a pivotal moment. They are brimming with potential yet beset by persistent challenges that hold back progress on the Sustainable Development Goals. Not least among these is the need to drive increased funding to areas most in need. Having long been seen as high-risk by the traditional financial architecture, these regions and countries have been underserved and lack the resources required to build inclusive economies and adapt to a changing climate. 2. Extreme poverty levels remain significantly high. Coupled with debt-to-gross domestic product (GDP) levels at their highest point in decades, rising food prices have increased food insecurity, instability and the risk of hunger. Less than half the population in LDCs have access to basic sanitation and some 500 million people still lack access to electricity.1 More than 231 million people in LDCs were expected to require humanitarian assistance in 2024, compared with 190 million in 2022.2 3. Making progress on the Sustainable Development Goals in these countries and achieving our collective goal of leaving no one behind will require additional support to strengthen productive capacities, develop and diversify inclusive economies and provide affordable access to adequate financial resources. Despite a record $287 billion in global official development assistance (ODA) in 2022, aid to LDCs fell by 4 per cent to $62 billion,3 following an 8 per cent decrease the previous year, while aid to SIDS fell by 13 per cent to $5.9 billion."

      "question": "What organizational improvements does the Joint Inspection Unit recommend?",
      "answer": "The Joint Inspection Unit (JIU) has made several recommendations aimed at improving organizational effectiveness and oversight within the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and other UN entities. Here are some key organizational improvements highlighted in the recent reports:\n\n1. **Strategic Evaluations**: The JIU recommends that the UNEP Evaluation Office increase the number of strategic or corporate evaluations in its annual work program. This is intended to enhance the strategic contribution of the Evaluation Office to UNEP's overall functioning, ensuring that evaluations are not only routine but also aligned with broader organizational goals [1].\n\n2. **Enhanced Oversight Mechanisms**: The JIU has noted concerns regarding the low acceptance rate of recommendations from the Board of Auditors and the JIU itself by various entities, including UNEP. To address this, it suggests that UNEP should integrate audit and evaluation reports into regular discussions at the Committee of Permanent Representatives. This would ensure that oversight issues are addressed more substantively rather than being deferred or treated informally [1].\n\n3. **Regular Communication with Member States**: The JIU emphasizes the importance of regular and structured communication between UNEP management and Member States regarding audit and evaluation findings. This aligns with the Governing Council's decision to enhance transparency and accountability [1].\n\n4. **Operational and Risk Management Improvements**: The establishment of the Operations and Risk Management Unit in UNEP is a step towards better coordination of internal and external audits. The JIU recommends that this unit should effectively follow up on oversight recommendations to ensure timely implementation [1].\n\n5. **Shared Services for Ethics Functions**: In the context of UN-Women, the JIU has highlighted the potential for establishing a shared service model for the ethics function across UN agencies. This could enhance efficiency and coherence in ethical governance, which is crucial for maintaining trust and integrity within the organization [2].\n\n6. **Streamlining Executive Board Operations**: The JIU has called for a review of the governance and oversight functions of the Executive Boards of various UN entities, including UN-Women. This involves streamlining proceedings to facilitate more strategic deliberations and timely decision-making, which is essential for effective governance [3][4].\n\nThese recommendations reflect a broader push within the UN system to enhance accountability, improve strategic oversight, and foster a culture of transparency and ethical governance. By implementing these improvements, the JIU aims to strengthen the overall effectiveness of UN operations and ensure that they are better aligned with the organization's goals and member states' expectations. \n\nIf you have any specific areas of interest or further questions about these recommendations, feel free to ask!",

        "management- led reviews; and (e) establishing a stable resource base and funding approach for the evaluation function. The Inspector observed overall progress on all these objectives; however, increased attention and further efforts would be needed for undertaking more strategic and corporate evaluations. 131. The implementation of the following recommendation is expected to strengthen the strategic contribution of the UNEP Evaluation Office to the overall functioning of the organization. Recommendation 8 The Committee of Permanent Representatives should request the Evaluation Office to consider the inclusion of a higher number of strategic or corporate evaluations in its annual work programme and to report back on their findings and conclusions. C. Oversight issues 132. Measures to enhance oversight. In its 2023 report, IAAC expressed concern regarding the low acceptance rate of recommendations issued by the Board of Auditors and JIU by several entities within the purview of the Secretariat, including UNEP,107 a situation that has been remedied as regards JIU recommendations. The Inspector welcomes the recent attention given to these matters by UNEP governing bodies and its management and makes the following observations: (a) At the request of the participants of the tenth Annual Subcommittee meeting (2023), an initiative was launched for having a standing agenda item on the consideration of evaluation reports and audits at the formal quarterly meetings of the Committee of Permanent Representatives, complementing the presentations made at the Annual Subcommittee meetings. In its response to the JIU questionnaire, UNEP management indicated that the reports issued by JIU, the Board of Auditors and OIOS would be integrated in this new approach, and the Inspector considers that this could be extended to the IAAC reports, when they contain considerations relevant to UNEP. This is in line with the provision of Governing Council decision 75 (IV) which called for such regular communications with Member States.108 However, after analysing the summaries of the meetings of the Committee since 2023, the Inspector notes with concern that: (a) in several instances, the discussions on these topics were deferred to future meetings and sometimes were downgraded to an informal subcommittee meeting; and (b) when discussed, the topics were referring mostly to statistics or general procedural aspects and rarely addressed substantive content. However, in the report of the Executive Director to the Committee of Permanent Representatives at its 168th meeting, in December 2024, progress was observed in that the document __________________ 106 OIOS Inspection and Evaluation Division, evaluation study entitled \u201cUnited Nations Evaluation Dashboard 2020\u20132021\u201d, 18 May 2023. 107 Report of IAAC on its activities for the period from 1 August 2022 to 31 July 2023 (A/78/286), annex I. 108 A/31/25, annex I. JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 25-10420 67 included links to relevant audit reports. The implementation of this measure must be confirmed by strong, established and effective related practices, to ensure proper guidance from Member States to the UNEP secretariat. The Inspector stresses the importance of properly discussing in the formal meetings of the Committee the findings and conclusions of audit and evaluation reports and the management responses, especially as oversight issues are currently not discussed at the level of the Environment Assembly. In this context, the Inspector believes that consideration should be given to inviting OIOS, as an independent function, to present its findings and recommendations to the Committee, either in person or virtually, as was also suggested in a recent management and administration review of UN-Habitat that identified a similar challenge;109 (b) Oversight indicators have been added to various internal reporting mechanisms, including the quarterly business review reports and monthly reports; (c) The Operations and Risk Management Unit, established in 2022, was tasked with ensuring coordination of internal and external audits and to follow up on oversight recommendations. Despite its limited capacity, the team supports the auditors and organizes follow-up meetings with the focal points throughout the year to ensure timely escalation of issues and implementation of recommendations; (d) An agreement with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime was signed, and the system called UNITE for Evaluations was introduced in June 2025. This is expected to streamline the evaluation process and the tracking of compliance with management responses, currently representing a significant administrative burden. The initial investment is $60,000. 133. Oversight findings and recommendations.",

He highlighted the 85 per cent increase in service requests as a positive indicator of growing trust in the ethics function. The Chief of Staff expressed deep appreciation to the ethics team for their steadfast contributions, and acknowledged the critical updates to the Protection against Retaliation Policy as tangible safeguards that reinforce a culture of safety and openness. He added that UN-Women welcomed the expanded learning and outreach effort in collaboration with UNDP, underscoring the importance of system-wide coherence and shared principles. On UN-Women\u2019s full compliance with the Financial Disclosure Programme, the Chief of Staff noted it as essential to maintaining public trust and managing conflicts of interest. He also stressed that UN-Women underscores the importance of enabling staff to raise concerns and praised the ethics function for its guidance. He further reiterated that UN-Women remains firmly committed to ensuring that the ethics function is fully independent and adequately resourced. Noting the current financial constraints, the Chief of Staff shared that, in line with the UN80 principles of streamlining and coherence, UN-Women is exploring establishing a shared service model for the ethics function with other agencies to enhance efficiency and coherence. He concluded by thanking the Ethics Advisor for her outstanding service. 20. After opening the floor, one delegation requested to know more about the shared ethics service that was proposed by the Entity and what the timeline for its creation will be. The delegation also wanted to know whether any current gaps that exist in the ethics model will be bridged with the creation of the potential new joint model. A separate delegation thanked the ethics function for their diligent work in helping to foster cultural change and encouraged the Entity to increase participation in mandatory ethics trainings, and to finalize key polices under review, such as the policy on gifts and hospitality. 21. Responding to Member States\u2019 interventions, the Ethics Advisor confirmed that the function is finalizing some of the key policies, including the policy on gifts and UNW/2025/6 9/22 25-12751 hospitality. She shared that an online system is being developed for personnel to streamline requests for how to dispose of gifts. In addition, she shared that there was an increase in the completion of mandatory ethics trainings in 2024, and that training certification is required before personnel can request outside activities review and approval. The Chief of Staff also responded to Member States comments by stating that the Executive Board will receive an update on the shared ethics function at the second regular session of 2025, and assured that there will be no gaps between the current function and the planned shared function. VI. Review of governance and oversight of the Executive Boards of the United Nations Development Programme/United Nations Population Fund/ United Nations Office for Project Services, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund and UN-Women 22. A representative speaking on behalf of the Joint Inspection Unit (JIU) working group provided the Executive Board with an update on the progress of the group in implementing recommendations of the JIU in accordance with decisions 2024/3 and 2025/2. The speaker presented the working methods and road map of the group, developed in the Terms of Reference approved earlier in the year. The speaker added that the JIU working group will form thematic subgroups to effectively cluster recommendations. The speaker shared that there was agreement in the group to take a case-by-case approach, ensuring that decision-making is better aligned and meaningful. 23. One delegation speaking on behalf of 33 Member States welcomed the update by the JIU working group and noted that a key objective of the review must be to streamline Executive Board proceedings to facilitate more strategic deliberations and timely decision-making. The group also noted that this process should be supported by relevant actors within the organizations, units responsible for governance and oversight, or the secretariats. The group added that a mapping exercise would be useful to establish harmonized Terms of Reference of the Board secretariats. They concluded by stating that the process should take into account parallel reform efforts such as UN80. 24.

The joint statement recognized UN-Women\u2019s efforts to implement the recommendations of the UN Board of Auditors, highlighting its 92 per cent implementation rate. The group of countries further noted areas of improvement identified by the report, including the allocation of core resources, and encouraged UN-Women to adhere to the Board of Auditor\u2019s recommendations in this regard. In addition, the group of countries encouraged UN-Women to strengthen its assurance activities life cycle by implementing an alert system. The joint statement urged UN-Women to perform monthly reconciliations with UNDP through the interfund cash clearing account to ensure timely payments are made by UNDP on behalf of UN-Women. Furthermore, UN-Women was encouraged to adhere to the recommendations to strengthen the support it gives to country offices to enable them to implement concrete actions that contribute to environmental sustainability. 17. In response, the Deputy Executive Director for Resource Management, Sustainability and Partnerships noted the progress made by UN-Women, highlighting the relative size and maturity of the Entity. The Deputy Executive Director went on to state that UN-Women is prepared to update its core resource allocation methodology ahead of the Executive Board\u2019s annual session 2026. She added that UN-Women is also working on the new integrated budget and internal core resource allocation tool in conjunction with updating its methodology. The Deputy stressed the importance of identifying priorities and opportunities through consultative processes while maintaining flexibility for allocating global funds at the regional level. The Director of the Strategy, Planning, Resources and Effectiveness Division confirmed that UN-Women is on track to update its core resource allocation methodology through reviewing its core resource allocation tool. The Director noted that the Entity is embedding procedures on social and environmental sustainability by building the capacities of staff at all levels through enhanced socialization. This will help personnel understand how to meet social and environmental requirements as part of a holistic approach to performance and planning. The Director of the Management and Administration Division ad interim concluded by stating that for the interfund cash clearing account, UN- Women and UNDP have made significant improvements to the reconciliation payment process and that UN-Women will continue to work with UNDP to further reduce discrepancies and maximize efficiencies in this matter. V. Joint Inspection Unit review of governance and oversight of the Executive Boards of UNDP/UNFPA/UNOPS, UNICEF and UN-Women 18. The President of the Executive Board representing the Western European and Others Group provided an update on the implementation of the assessment of how the Executive Board executes its governance and oversight functions following the Joint Inspection Unit (JIU) report JIU/REP/2023/7 and as mandated by Executive Board Decision 2024/3. She noted that in November UNW/2025/1 7/20 2024, the Bureau of UN-Women\u2019s Executive Board received preliminary comments from the Entity\u2019s management and independent offices on the JIU report which have since been posted online. The President shared that a working group comprised of 15 Member States with cross-board and equal regional representation was approved through a silent agreement procedure on 24 January 2025. She noted that the UN-Women Bureau collaborated with the Bureaux of UNDP/UNFPA/UNOPS and UNICEF to draft the terms of reference for the working group which have been approved by the other Executive Boards during their first regular sessions, and she expressed the hope that the Board of UN-Women would do likewise. The President underscored the importance of this process in ensuring the effectiveness and governance of the Board and the role it has in helping UN-Women deliver on its mandate, while urging Member States to remain committed in advancing shared goals in this regard. 19. After the floor was opened, a group of Member States emphasized the importance of the JIU review for enhancing the governance and oversight of the Executive Boards, with the objective of maximizing the ability of United Nations entities to deliver.

Country programme documents are fully aligned with UNSDCFs, and Resident Coordinator confirmation letters are routinely submitted. UNFPA reiterated its strong commitment to the Resident Coordinator system, to timely cost-sharing contributions, and to performance transparency through the use of established reform indicators. 47. The UNOPS Deputy Executive Director (Delivery and Partnerships) outlined the organization\u2019s contributions to the efficiency agenda. She highlighted United Nations Web Buy Plus and human resources services as key global shared services provided by UNOPS to other United Nations entities. UNOPS also actively participates in the common back-office initiative, citing its partnership with UNICEF in Pakistan with a view to becoming a lead service provider. On the MAF, she welcomed efforts to streamline guidance and reaffirmed UNOPS support for the Resident Coordinator system and dual reporting, emphasizing the value of mutual feedback between Resident Coordinators and entity representatives. In 2024, UNOPS participated in 94 UNSDCFs and supported 13 common country analyses. In addition to the current indicators in the reform checklist, UNOPS is developing a set of results and performance indicators to inform its next Strategic Plan. She emphasized the importance of sharpening system-wide metrics to incentivize performance and enhancing collective communication to demonstrate the impact of reform. 48.

Update on the assessment of how the Executive Board executes its governance and oversight functions 49. The Executive Board received an update from the Co-Chair of the Joint Working Group of the Executive Boards of UNDP/UNFPA/UNOPS, UNICEF, and UN-Women on the governance and oversight functions of the Executive Boards and to examine the recommendations of the JIU report entitled Review of the governance and oversight functions of the Executive Boards of the UNDP, UNFPA, UNOPS, UNICEF and UN-Women (JIU/REP/2023/7). 50. The Co-Chair of the Joint Working Group provided an update on the progress of the group\u2019s work to assess and advance the recommendations of the JIU report. He recalled the group\u2019s establishment following the 2024 annual session and expressed appreciation to the 15 Member State representatives for their active engagement and collaborative spirit. The Co-Chair emphasized that the swift adoption of the group\u2019s term of reference and working methods- based on inclusivity, structure, and consensus- demonstrated strong commitment to strengthening governance and oversight across the four Boards. 51. The Co-Chair outlined the roadmap guiding the group\u2019s work, organized into four phases: (i) mapping and categorizing the JIU recommendations; (ii) identifying areas for early action; (iii) conducting in-depth review of more complex or structural issues; and (iv) preparing thematic clusters with supporting sub-groups to enable focused discussion. He noted that the group had already consulted with the JIU to revisit the recommendations in light of evolving financial and institutional contexts and underscored the importance of building early momentum while recognizing that it was premature to present \u201cquick wins\u201d at this stage. Nonetheless, the group saw value in identifying non-contentious, actionable items to build trust and demonstrate early progress. 52. Looking ahead, the Co-Chair confirmed that the next meeting of the Joint Working Group was scheduled for mid-July, where substantive discussions would begin. While the Terms of Reference anticipated decision points at each Board session, the group agreed that a case-by-case approach to decision-making would ensure relevance and alignment with the group\u2019s pace of work. Regular updates will be provided to maintain transparency. The Co-Chair concluded by reaffirming the time-bound nature of the mandate, the group\u2019s commitment to an agile and Member State-driven process, and its openness to supporting broader reform efforts through governance insights that may emerge over the course of its work. 53.

There are areas where AUSSOM could find more efficiencies, including in contingent-owned equipment (major equipment) and self-sustainment. The upcoming review of the statement of unit requirements, as part of the reconfiguration of AUSSOM, could be helpful in that regard. A comparative analysis may also be needed to determine whether it would be more economical for troop- and police-contributing countries to provide additional categories of self-sustainment7 or for UNSOS to continue providing such support. In addition, there appears to be underutilization of military aviation assets in the mission, especially in the light of the lack of cross-sector air support, even when provided for in the concept of operations. A deeper analysis of actual usage of existing military aircraft may also present opportunities for cost reductions. Moreover, there are cost avoidance opportunities in the management of contingent-owned equipment beyond economic repair that should be destroyed in-country rather than repatriated at great cost. 30. As noted, AUSSOM and UNSOS can work together in various areas to find more efficiencies. The reconfiguration of AUSSOM could potentially yield savings if careful consideration is given to the most efficient and effective configuration of the mission\u2019s aviation fleet and the new layout of its bases. With such changes, it might be possible to find efficiencies in the resupply of life support to the bases, but it would take time to implement them. 31. Lastly, there are various areas in which UNSOS can strive to find more efficiency gains, by reviewing the manner in which it executes some aspects of its support package. Some potential areas to reassess are the mine action delivery model, which still relies predominantly on the United Nations Office for Project Services, and greater use of local procurement, in particular for delivery of supplies to the Somali security forces. __________________ 7 The Security Council, in its resolution 2010 (2011), decided, on an exceptional basis and owing to the unique character of the African Union Mission in Somalia, to extend logistical support to cover augmentation of some limited areas of self-sustainment, including catering equipment and training, communications equipment, sanitary and cleaning materials, furniture and stationery. A/79/907 S/2025/268 25-06872 10/24 Recommendations 32. The overall cost reduction of $61.6 million identified represents the balance between current UNSOS support for AUSSOM and the acceptable risk levels to its operations. Without additional budget assessments, this amount, as stated above (see para. 28), is insufficient to fully meet the $132.1 million needed from the assessed budget for troop reimbursements in the 2025/26 budget period at the mission specific rate of $1,000 proposed in the joint report. Moreover, the overall identified cost reduction will not be fully available on 1 July 2025 and will need to be phased over the course of the 2025/26 budget year. Furthermore, contributions from the African Union will be important to securing the $44.1 million that is to be mobilized as extra- budgetary resources. 33. On the operational support front, implementation of reduced support and costs would need to be phased, both to ensure mitigation measures are put in place and also to allow the necessary time to amend and terminate contracts. On the staffing front, while UNSOS can reduce positions that present a low or medium risk for its operational support to AUSSOM, a more thorough review should be done by UNSOS to ensure that an in-depth analysis is undertaken to guide reductions in staffing levels. In view of the light footprint of UNSOS, additional support in operational workforce planning can be sought from Headquarters in order to review and align staffing and structures with priorities and the concept of operations. Doing so is important because the staffing level and composition of UNSOS had been specifically configured to provide effective support to the successive African Union missions and the Support Office\u2019s concept of operations. Furthermore, the staffing reduction may have to be implemented in the light of the delayed reconfiguration of ATMIS to AUSSOM, as it entails several activity-intense components, including the reorientation and realignment of all troops (both African Union and Somalia security forces) to the new mission disposition, which itself entails the closing and handing over of forward and tactical operating bases. This reconfiguration will also include the repatriation of existing troops and equipment and the deployment of new troops and equipment."
