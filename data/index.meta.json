Introduction 1. The review of management and administration in the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) is part of a series of management and administration reviews conducted by the Joint Inspection Unit (JIU) in line with its long-term strategic framework for the period 2020\u20132029.1 The review was conducted at a time following the approval and implementation of a new delivery model (the Policy for One UNEP Delivery for Better Collaboration and Country Support), which represented a shift in the modus operandi of the organization. The timing of the review also coincides with the preparation of the medium-term strategy for the period 2026\u2013 2029. Lastly, the review is published ahead of the seventh session of the United Nations Environment Assembly, planned to be held in December 2025. 2 Two JIU outputs were produced: (a) a concise report, issued under the symbol JIU/REP/2025/1, focusing on the main findings, conclusions and recommendations and available in the six official languages of the United Nations; and (b) the present expanded report, providing a broader analysis and supporting information in English only. 3 A. Background 2. Foundation and mandate of UNEP. The United Nations Environment Programme was established by the General Assembly in its resolution 2997 (XXVII) in 1972 to promote international cooperation in the environment field and to coordinate environmental matters within the United Nations system. Member States reaffirmed and strengthened this mandate over the years, while also configuring the governance framework, which evolved as illustrated in figure I. The outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, held in 2012, entitled \u201cThe future we want\u201d, emphasized the role of the Programme as the leading global environmental authority that sets the global environmental agenda, promotes the coherent implementation of the environmental dimension of sustainable development within the United Nations system and serves as an authoritative advocate for the global environment.4 Alongside its mandate, the Programme\u2019s membership has expanded and its activities have diversified and expanded in time to address operational and programmatic aspects of the objectives set forth in its medium-term strategies and the resolutions adopted by the United Nations Environment Assembly. __________________ 1 A/74/34, annex I, and A/79/34. 2 During the preparation of the review, the UN80 Initiative was launched, which may have a direct impact on the management and administration of UNEP in the short to medium term. 3 The underlying data and additional annexes are available on the Unit\u2019s website, as a supplementary paper. 4 See General Assembly resolution 66/288, annex, para. 88.

Strategic objectives of UNEP. The strategic planning document entitled \u201cFor people and planet: the United Nations Environment Programme strategy for 2022\u20132025 to tackle climate change, loss of nature and pollution\u201d describes how the organization intends to address environmental planetary crises",

Strategic objectives of UNEP. The strategic planning document entitled \u201cFor people and planet: the United Nations Environment Programme strategy for 2022\u20132025 to tackle climate change, loss of nature and pollution\u201d describes how the organization intends to address environmental planetary crises though three strategic objectives outlined as: (a) \u201cClimate stability\u201d; (b) \u201cLiving in harmony with nature\u201d; and (c) \u201cTowards a pollution-free planet\u201d.5 As stated therein, UNEP supports an integrated and balanced implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and aims at building Member States\u2019 and partners\u2019 capacity to integrate the environment into all aspects of sustainable development. UNEP is a custodian (or co-custodian) of a series of Sustainable Development Goal indicators and associated targets. 6 4. UNEP facts and figures. UNEP headquarters is located in Nairobi, Kenya. In April 2025, its organizational structure comprised eight divisions, six regional offices and six subregional offices, as well as country, liaison and programme offices, as presented in annex I. In terms of financial resources, the organization mostly relies on voluntary contributions to deliver on its programme of work. For the biennium 2022\u20132023, UNEP income reached $1.35 billion, surpassing its projected budget of $872.9 million. As regards human resources, at the end of 2024, the UNEP workforce comprised almost 1,400 staff members and about 1,500 affiliate personnel. 5. United Nations Secretariat regulatory framework. In accordance with Secretary-General\u2019s bulletin ST/SGB/2015/3, the UNEP secretariat is integrated in the organizational structure of the Secretariat of the United Nations and is subject to the strategies, policies and initiatives approved by the General Assembly and the directives of the Secretary-General. In the context of an increasingly operational- __________________ 5 UNEP/EA.5/3/Rev.1, para. 42. 6 Ibid., para. 33. JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 25-10420 3 oriented organizational setting, UNEP has developed its own operational guidance in several areas, as found necessary. 6. United Nations system environmental framework. As important elements for establishing and delivering international environmental commitments at the global or regional levels, a series of multilateral environmental agreements have been adopted over the years, each with their own governance arrangements and secretariat structure. These structures are located, in most cases, away from UNEP headquarters. Their strategic planning and budget documents are approved by their own governing bodies and UNEP is providing support services for the functioning of their secretariats. The resolution adopted in 2016 by the Environment Assembly frames the relationship between UNEP and the multilateral environmental agreements for which it provides the secretariat. 7 There are currently 15 UNEP-administered secretariats and two action plans. While the scope of the present review does not extend to the governance of the multilateral environmental agreements, the report makes reference to opportunities and constraints arising from these arrangements and provides suggestions for improving their efficiency and effectiveness in the future. 8 In this context, the report will be shared for information with the executive heads of the secretariats of the UNEP-administered multilateral environmental agreements. B. Objectives, scope and methodology 7. Objectives and scope. The objective of the present review is to provide an independent assessment of organizational arrangements and processes, regulatory frameworks and related practices concerning the management and administration of UNEP, with a view to enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of the organization for supporting its mandate delivery and its strategic objectives listed in its medium- term strategic document. The Inspector examined the following areas: governance; organizational structure; management and administrative services; financial framework; strategic planning, partnerships and risk management; human resources management; communications and knowledge management; information and communications technology (ICT); and oversight. In accordance with the terms of reference for the review, considerations regarding organizational performance in operational areas are only included when found relevant for the study of management and administrative processes. 8.

Methodology. In accordance with JIU internal standards and working procedures, the Inspector applied a range of qualitative and quantitative data collection methods, using various sources to ensure the consistency, validity and reliability of the findings. Information used is current as of April 2025. In line with the Unit\u2019s collaborative approach, comments and suggestions from UNEP management were sought at various stages of the process. The Inspector appreciated the collaboration and responsiveness of UNEP management and wishes to express appreciation to UNEP managers and personnel who assisted in the preparation of the report by participating in interviews or surveys and who willingly shared their knowledge and opinions. 9. The preparation of the report included: (a) A desk review. The Inspector reviewed extensive documentation pertaining to the meetings of the Committee of Permanent Representatives and the __________________ 7 UNEP/EA.2/Res.18. 8 JIU reviewed environmental governance matters within the United Nations system in its reports entitled \u201cPost-Rio+20 review of environmental governance within the United Nations system\u201d (JIU/REP/2014/4) and \u201cManagement review of environmental governance within the United Nations system\u201d (JIU/REP/2008/3). JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 4 25-10420 Environment Assembly, as well as reports produced by internal and external oversight bodies. Strategic documents, internal policies, administrative instructions and other related internal documents were also examined; (b) Questionnaires. UNEP management provided a corporate response to a questionnaire covering the main areas of management and administration, supplemented by relevant data and documentation. In addition, two online questionnaires gathered information and opinions from the heads of field and programme offices as well as from the secretariats of the multilateral environmental agreements (see annex II for further details); (c) Interviews with UNEP senior managers and resource persons. Leveraging insights from the responses to the questionnaires, the Inspector conducted interviews with the Executive Director and her deputy, the directors of all technical divisions, and the chiefs and staff of sections or units in charge of key administrative, management and oversight functions. Regional directors were interviewed separately, as were the heads of the liaison offices in Brussels and New York. The Inspector met with the Regional Ombudsman in Nairobi and with the President of the United Nations Nairobi Staff Union and Outposted Offices, as well as with members of UNEP personnel. The Inspector received input from the directors of the three divisions of the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS). Interviews were conducted between November 2024 and February 2025; (d) Online surveys of UNEP personnel. In January 2025, online surveys designed and administered by JIU were distributed to all categories of personnel at all locations, including the UNEP-administered multilateral environmental agreement secretariats. As the level of participation among staff members was high, the respective survey results are statistically valid, with a margin of error of 3 per cent and a confidence level of 95 per cent. These results are referenced in various sections of the report (see annex II for further details); (e) Views of Member States. The views of Member States were gathered through interviews with the Chair and members of the 2024 Bureau of the Committee of Permanent Representatives, as well as with most 2024 Chairs of the regional and other groups. JIU conducted two online surveys: one addressed to the members of the Committee of Permanent Representatives and one to the representatives of Member States at the sixth session of the Environment Assembly, in 2024. The Inspector regrets that the participation in these surveys was insufficient to inform the analysis. This appears to be a persistent challenge also faced by UNEP management in previous surveys of representatives of Member States (for example those conducted in the context of the programme performance reports for 2022 and 2023); (f) Views of other stakeholders.",

The Inspector interviewed panels of experts from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the Green Climate Fund (GCF), which are the main sources of global (vertical) funds for UNEP. 10. Finalization of the report. In accordance with article 11 (2) of the statute of the Joint Inspection Unit and for quality assurance purposes, the draft report was subjected to an internal peer review to obtain comments from JIU Inspectors and to test the recommendations against the collective wisdom of the Unit. The revised report was circulated to UNEP management to correct any factual errors and provide comments on the findings, conclusions and recommendations. All types of contributions were processed with due respect for the confidentiality standards applied by JIU. The report was finalized taking into consideration all the comments received, although the final responsibility for the review rests solely with the author. 11. Recommendations. The present report is directed to UNEP executive management as well as the members of the United Nations Environment Assembly JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 25-10420 5 and the Committee of Permanent Representatives. As presented also in the concise report, the review contains eight formal recommendations, of which three are addressed to the governing bodies and five to the Executive Director. These recommendations are complemented by 27 informal recommendations (of which 18 are also found in the concise report) appearing in bold in the narrative and providing additional suggestions for reinforcing the management framework and related practices at UNEP. II. Governance framework A. Governance 12. Multi-tiered governance. The governance of the Programme must be viewed in the broader context of the United Nations system, as presented in figure II, which shows the various frameworks relevant to the organization. In addition to its own multi-tiered governance structure, as a United Nations programme, UNEP reports to the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council and to their respective subsidiary bodies for administrative and budgetary matters (the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions) and programme planning (the Committee for Programme and Coordination). The overall environmental governance framework of the system also includes the governing bodies of the multilateral environmental agreements to which UNEP provides secretariat support. Figure II United Nations Environment Programme governance framework Source: Prepared by JIU (2025). JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 6 25-10420 United Nations Environment Assembly 13. Environment Assembly. In 2012, the General Assembly, in paragraph 4 (b) of its resolution 67/213, granted universal membership to the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme and changed its designation to the \u201cUnited Nations Environment Assembly of the United Nations Environment Programme\u201d. The Environment Assembly is considered the world\u2019s highest-level decision-making body for matters related to the environment and reports to the General Assembly. It held its first session in 2014 and meets biennially for a one-week session to set the global environmental agenda, undertake policy review and provide overarching policy guidance, set the strategic guidance on the future direction of the Programme and define policy responses to address emerging environmental challenges. The Inspector intended to assess whether this expansion of the membership had contributed to enhancing the governance process of the organization, but no conclusions were reached due to the insufficient participation of key stakeholders in the JIU online surveys. Participation in the Environment Assembly primarily gathers representatives from ministries of environment, major groups and stakeholders (such as civil society and private sector representatives), other international organizations and scientists from across the globe. A good practice identified by the Inspector is the definition of indicators linked to policymaking organs in UNEP strategic planning documents, referring to the activities of the Environment Assembly.",

A good practice identified by the Inspector is the definition of indicators linked to policymaking organs in UNEP strategic planning documents, referring to the activities of the Environment Assembly. As the highest-level governing body of UNEP, the Environment Assembly has authority on the management and administration of the UNEP secretariat. Historically, however, its meetings have only allowed for a limited number of such topics to be discussed and decided upon. For example, during the past three Environment Assembly sessions, the few management decisions taken were related to the approval of UNEP strategic and budget documents or the management of trust funds. The Inspector acknowledges the challenge of accommodating negotiations and agreements on all substantive resolutions and administrative decisions during Environment Assembly sessions but stresses the importance of giving due attention to management and administration issues. The subsidiary intersessional body of the Environment Assembly, the Committee of Permanent Representatives, thus plays a pivotal role in guiding the secretariat on management and administration matters and ensuring oversight on these topics. However, as outlined in the paragraphs below, the role of the Committee in this regard has been the subject of attention among Member States in recent years in an effort to improve its work and decision-making process as intersessional governing body of UNEP between Assembly sessions. Committee of Permanent Representatives 14. Mandate of the Committee of Permanent Representatives. In 1985, the Governing Council established the Committee of Permanent Representatives as an intersessional subsidiary organ. At the time, the Governing Council would hold formal two-week sessions every two years and, in most in-between years, special sessions to address specific programmatic issues. These arrangements granted more time to discuss management and administration matters during formal sessions of the Governing Council. In accordance with its terms of reference, the Committee currently meets in formal sessions four times per year to oversee the implementation of the UNEP medium-term strategies and biennial programmes of work and to prepare the sessions of the Environment Assembly, including by providing advice on policy matters.9 Its meetings are organized either in person or as hybrid meetings. UNEP management also sees these meetings as an opportunity for Member States and other __________________ 9 Governing Council decisions 19/32 (1997), paras. 7 and 10, and 27/2 (2013), para. 9. JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 25-10420 7 stakeholders to engage in dialogue with the Executive Director and key senior management personnel. 15. Accreditation of Member States to the Committee. Participation in the Committee is conditional on prior accreditation of the permanent missions. The Inspector notes the efforts conducted by UNEP management towards increasing the number of accredited members and sees this as beneficial for the organization, given that accredited members are more likely to contribute financially to the organization over the medium to long term, particularly through the Environment Fund. One can observe a significant increase in the number of accredited Member States between 2012 and 2024, from 95 to 149 (see table 1). There are benefits to accreditation for the Member States in terms of their capacity to exercise closer oversight of the organization and in terms of information received on the activities and achievements of UNEP. The newly accredited missions mostly belonged to the Eastern European States and the Asia-Pacific Group and do not have an on-site representation in Nairobi. However, at the time of the review, 44 Member States had not requested such accreditation. Moreover, among accredited members, only 94 had an on-site representation in Nairobi in 2024. These aspects can be seen as challenges to the governance of the organization.

The Committee of Permanent Representatives has various distinct subcommittees. In addition to the formal meetings, which are subject to specific rules in terms of documentation and support, the Committee has three informal types of meetings: (a) The Annual Subcommittee convenes for five consecutive days to review, with the support of the UNEP secretariat, the medium-term strategy and the programme of work and budget and to oversee their implementation and accountability by the secretariat.10 The content analysis of the documentation related to the meetings held from 2020 to 2024 confirms that the Annual Subcommittee is a primary channel for UNEP management to provide information on management, administrative and financial matters and therefore is well placed to exercise an oversight function. The outcome of its work is recorded in a document entitled \u201cChair\u2019s summary\u201d, which is submitted to the Committee of Permanent Representatives at a subsequent formal meeting. At the eleventh meeting of the Annual Subcommittee, in July 2024, a new practice emerged that consists of including in the Chair\u2019s summary a list of draft decisions or recommendations proposed for consideration and possible adoption in formal Committee meetings, a practice which is further analysed in paragraph 18 below; __________________ 10 Governing Council decision 27/2 (2013) (contained in document UNEP/GC.27/17), para. 11. JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 8 25-10420 (b) Subcommittee meetings are held in accordance with a decision of the Governing Council from 1997 to have briefings on the UNEP project portfolio, the implementation of resolutions or other specific issues. 11 On average, the agendas of meetings held between 2022 and 2024 included two substantive items per session, and in some cases only one (addressing nonetheless broad thematic environmental matters); in 2024, the subcommittee held 21 meetings. 12 The Inspector believes that there is room for improvement in the planning and management of these subcommittee meetings in terms of consolidating their agendas, minimizing their frequency and therefore alleviating to some extent the workload of the members of the Committee and the UNEP secretariat; (c) The Open-ended Committee of Permanent Representatives is a week-long session convened biennially as a preparatory setting for the Environment Assembly. The Open-ended Committee contributes to advancing negotiations for draft resolutions and decisions for adoption by the Environment Assembly.13 In practice, at least 80 per cent of the resolutions transmitted by the Open-ended Committee were adopted by the Assembly. 17. Governance matters for attention. The effectiveness of the governance framework has been examined in an exercise known as the Consensual Process for Review by the Committee of Permanent Representatives, which was launched with a stocktaking meeting in 2020 and for which an agreement on the final outcome was reached at the eight meeting of the Annual Subcommittee, in 2021. The outcome document was endorsed in 2022 by the Environment Assembly in its decision 5/4, and its implementation gradually started as from 2023. It aimed to clarify the roles of the various Committee meeting formats. The Inspector considers that the outcome document would have benefited from further additional clarity on several procedural and operational aspects, which had to be further addressed in subsequent formal and informal Committee meetings. While several decisions aiming to clarify the implementation of the outcome document have been taken since and gradually enacted (see point (c) below), the Inspector notes the absence of an indicative implementation timeline for the agreed provisions of that document. In its response to the JIU questionnaire, UNEP management considered the governance framework adequate to drive the work of the organization. However, the Inspector makes the following observations on several matters deserving attention: (a) In relation to the membership. Not all Member States maintain a representation in Kenya, and when there is one, delegates could face challenges in providing oversight on scientifically versed environmental matters while concurrently managing multiple diplomatic portfolios, a context which is demanding and may require compromises in terms of engagement and time, particularly for smaller missions.",

This situation is beyond UNEP management control but must be acknowledged as a characteristic of the governance of the organization. To facilitate engagement, the Inspector notes as a good practice the annual orientation sessions offered since 2017 by the UNEP secretariat to accredited members to the Committee of Permanent Representatives. On average, about 70 delegates benefited from those sessions each year. These efforts are important to enrich understanding and knowledge of the organization among its key governance stakeholders and to support their active __________________ 11 Governing Council decision 19/32 (1997) (contained in document UNEP/GC.19/34), para. 10. 12 Substantive items do not include points related to the adoption of the agenda, other matters and the closing of the meeting. 13 In the year preceding a session of the Environment Assembly, the Annual Subcommittee also provides a forum for the announcement and/or presentation of draft resolutions and decisions to be tackled by the Assembly (as clarified in paragraph 24 of the Chair\u2019s summary of the eighth annual meeting of the Committee (UNEP/ASC.8/6)and endorsed by the Environment Assembly in its decision 5/4). JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 25-10420 9 participation. An additional layer of complexity of the work of delegates is their accountability to governmental structures in their respective countries and the corresponding reporting and decision-making mechanisms; (b) In relation to the costs of current arrangements. The current arrangements translate into a significant number of meetings, formal and informal, that require attention and support by the UNEP secretariat. Quarterly meetings of the Committee have recurrent costs associated with interpretation, room rental, technical support, processing of documentation and use of online platforms for hybrid meetings. In addition, UNEP has mobilized extrabudgetary contributions to support the travel of nominated participants from developing countries to join key meetings, such as the Annual Subcommittee. The number of meetings peaked in 2022 and 2024, with more than 40 meetings each year. These represented a cost to the organization (between 2022 and 2024, for 121 meetings, close to $1.3 million for travel and $133,000 for other meeting and hospitality costs), only partly covered by the regular budget for official calendar meetings; (c) In relation to the organization of work of the Committee of Permanent Representatives. The mandate of the Committee was defined and refined by a parent body (the Governing Council) that had a narrower membership and more frequent, longer meetings than the Environment Assembly. As UNEP has evolved, the members of the Committee have reflected on its mandate and on ways to enhance its role for guiding the work of the UNEP secretariat. Indeed, up until 2023, the Committee has been essentially a setting for the UNEP secretariat to present information, followed by individual statements of participating delegations. The 2022 Consensual Process provided the basis for initiating the discussions regarding the organization of the work of the Committee. Since 2023, the Committee has undertaken a series of initiatives for clarifying the process of adoption of decisions or recommendations deriving from subcommittee meetings, their endorsement at quarterly meetings and requesting the support of the secretariat in providing status updates on their implementation.14 The research conducted by JIU shows that the organization of the work of the Committee remains a process that is cumbersome and difficult to grasp, in particular when referring to the identification of decisions and their adoption process, a situation which can be linked to its current arrangements as regards meeting formats and their frequency, as described above. In this context, the Inspector suggests addressing the following matters: (a) avoiding to the extent possible the deferral of discussions on various agenda points to future Committee meetings, as the research conducted by JIU found recurring cases of agenda items in quarterly Committee meetings that were postponed or, at times, downgraded to subcommittee meeting discussions; and (b) enhancing the mechanisms for mon",

Role of the Committee of Permanent Representatives. The Inspector recalls that in September 2024, at the request of the Committee, the UNEP secretariat issued an explanatory note on the mandate of the Committee and its decision-making authority.16 That note, which provided an interpretation by the UNEP secretariat of the existing relevant legal provisions, was not presented at a formal Committee meeting but in one of the subcommittee meetings. The document emphasizes the Committee\u2019s mandate for oversight, monitoring and review and its role in ensuring __________________ 14 UNEP/CPR/162/7/Rev.1 and UNEP/CPR/167/9/Rev.1. 15 UNEP/CPR/162/7/Rev.1, para. 7. 16 Note on the mandate of the Committee of Permanent Representatives (2024, no reference number) presented at the Committee of Permanent Representatives subcommittee meeting, 29 October 2024. JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 10 25-10420 the accountability of the work of the UNEP secretariat. In the understanding of the Inspector, however, the note refers to decisions of the Committee as proposals put forward to the Environment Assembly for adoption as either decisions or resolutions. Nonetheless, considering the focus of Environment Assembly sessions on programmatic matters and the fact that the mandate of the Committee was established under a previous governance framework which operated in a different context and with different specificities, the Inspector believes that the role of the Committee of Permanent Representatives, as the intersessional subsidiary body of the Environment Assembly, could be enhanced and further elevated by clarifying its capacity to guide the work of the UNEP secretariat. One other matter of clarification is on the capacity of the Committee to request the UNEP secretariat to undertake corrective measures in between sessions of the Environment Assembly, as appropriate, thus leveraging the extensive information reported by the UNEP secretariat for the Committee\u2019s review. The pertinence of the quarterly frequency of formal meetings of the Committee of Permanent Representatives could also be examined, in particular if the Committee\u2019s capacity to adopt decisions or recommendations in between Environment Assembly sessions is confirmed. In this context, less frequent formal meetings of the Committee would allow more time for: (a) the Committee members to effectively negotiate and discuss in informal meetings the draft texts of decisions or recommendations before sending them for adoption; and (b) the UNEP secretariat to implement decisions of the Committee, instead of preparing reports and associated documentation for quarterly formal Committee meetings. 19. The implementation of the following recommendation is expected to enhance the effectiveness of the governance arrangements of the organization. Recommendation 1 The United Nations Environment Assembly should, at its eighth session at the latest, clarify the mandate and role of the Committee of Permanent Representatives as its intersessional body and examine the frequency of its formal meetings, as appropriate. B. Executive management 20. UNEP executive management. In accordance with the founding resolution, the UNEP secretariat is headed by an Executive Director appointed by the General Assembly for a term of four years at the level of Under-Secretary-General. The Executive Director is accountable to and reports to the Secretary-General and the Environment Assembly. The source of authority of the Executive Director to manage the organization stems from the Secretary-General\u2019s bulletin on the delegation of authority in the administration of the Staff Regulations and Rules and the Financial Regulations and Rules.17 The current Executive Director took office in 2019 and is assisted by a Deputy Executive Director at the Assistant Secretary-General level.",

There is a consensus within the organization that the current executive management tenure has corresponded to an increased attention to management-related issues, translating to the launch of several initiatives focused on strategic planning and risk management, as well as efforts to strengthen relations with the secretariats of the multilateral environmental agreements and enhance the quality of administrative and financial support. __________________ 17 ST/SGB/2019/2. JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 25-10420 11 21. Performance of the executive management function monitored through indicators included in the programme of work and budget. In addition to the compact signed by the Executive Director with the Secretary-General,18 the Inspector notes the good practice consisting in having a set of four outcomes and indicators associated with executive direction and management included in the programme of work and budget and subsequently reported on in the annual programme performance reports. However, the Inspector draws attention to the fact that most of these outcomes and indicators correspond to high-level areas of impact and are not solely a direct outcome of executive management activities, for example, the uptake of environmental issues or approaches, and Governments rating UNEP support as good quality. The organization would benefit from reviewing and reconsidering these outcomes and indicators for future medium-term strategies and focusing on indicators more closely related to the executive management function. The Inspector recalls a useful indicator included in the 2020\u20132021 programme of work and budget assessing the extent to which UNEP senior management decisions were informed by management and performance information derived from business intelligence data. However, that indicator was removed from subsequent iterations. III. Management A. Organizational structure 22. Organizational structure. The organization of the secretariat of the United Nations Environment Programme is described in Secretary-General\u2019s bulletin ST/SGB/2006/13. That document has not been updated since its issuance and it no longer reflects the way in which UNEP management has structured the organization to function and execute the delivery of its mandate. Therefore, the Inspector suggests the timely finalization of a revised bulletin. In addition, the Inspector notes that currently the UNEP programme of work and budget and section 14 of the programme budget of the United Nations take different approaches in presenting the organizational structure (one reflecting the main organizational entities and one referring to the subprogrammes), while the narrative is built on subprogrammes in both documents. According to the chart available on UNEP website as of April 2025 (see annex I), the current structure comprises three corporate divisions reporting directly to the Executive Director and five technical divisions which report to the Deputy Executive Director. The Executive Director also directly oversees several offices. The Inspector observed significant differences between the divisions regarding their structure and resources, as presented in table 2. Such variations can be explained in part by the volume and scope of the activities managed and their funding streams. Furthermore, the analysis showed that overall, in UNEP, the ratio between directors and staff was 1:21, while the ratio between staff at the P-5 level and other staff was 1:10 (as of December 2024). Certain significant deviations from these average ratios were observed when looking across technical divisions and particularly across regional offices. The Inspector encourages UNEP management to review whether the current ratio between senior management positions and staff meets the needs of the organization, considering its portfolio of activities and delivery model. __________________ 18 Senior managers\u2019 compact issued annually (internal document).

Consolidation of headquarters functions in Nairobi. Until recently, UNEP, along with the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), were the only United Nations organizations with a global mandate whose headquarters were located in the global South. In this context, in paragraph 88 (g) of General Assembly resolution 66/288, entitled \u201cThe future we want\u201d, Member States requested a progressive consolidation of headquarters functions in Nairobi. Indeed, the directors of the divisions are posted at headquarters, alongside 53 per cent of staff members. However, several technical divisions maintain a strong presence outside Nairobi. For example, in the case of the Climate Change Division, more than 50 per cent of its staff are based outside Nairobi, with Paris accounting for 31 per cent, Geneva for 13 per cent and Bangkok for 7 per cent. While acknowledging the UNEP management justification for the outposted offices as being effective in supporting the organization\u2019s objectives and enhancing relations with donors, the Inspector underscores the need for an analysis of the appropriateness of having such a high number of posts deployed away from headquarters, in the light of the ongoing requirement to pursue consolidation as mandated, also considering the UN80 Initiative. 24. Field presence. The UNEP field presence is organized in regional, subregional and country offices and programmes and liaison offices, with all six regional offices reporting to the Deputy Executive Director. In accordance with its mandate, UNEP initially was not intended to have a large field presence, but the evolution of its funding model and portfolio of activities steered the organization towards further deployment at the country level. The effectiveness of its field presence has attracted the attention of UNEP management for years, guided by the need to balance the resources available with effective mandate delivery. A policy paper was issued in 2015 to define the principles governing the regional field presence; those principles were further analysed JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 25-10420 13 in 2018 as part of the work of the Country Presence Committee to explore modalities for strengthening national, subregional and regional presence. 19 Subsequently, the UNEP senior management team approved a new approach and strategy in December 2021 and endorsed the Policy for One UNEP Delivery for Better Collaboration and Country Support in August 2022. The objective was to clarify and partially redefine the roles and responsibilities of technical divisions and regional offices within the organization, as further analysed in paragraphs 41\u201346 below. Currently, the UNEP field presence is primarily regionally based as the resources do not allow for a strong country presence. The organization thus makes use of partnerships and alliances at the local, national, regional and global levels to promote its environmental mandate. In 2024, 47 per cent of UNEP staff were posted in offices away from headquarters (outposted branches, regional offices and other programme offices). Geneva, Montreal and Paris gather 21 per cent of outposted personnel. Besides funding staff posts, resources allocated to regional offices are limited (see table 3). The inputs from field officials and their personnel reflect a holistic opinion that the human and financial resources allocated to their offices are scarce and impose management constraints and limitations on activities.",

Mandate of organizational entities. Most organizational divisions and offices are further split into sections, branches and/or units. These structures maintain individual dedicated pages describing their core functions on the UNEP internal information-sharing platform (weCollaborate). The level of detail and scope of information presented therein may vary; nonetheless, the practice provides a good general understanding of the roles and responsibilities across the organization. The JIU survey indeed indicates that the mandate, responsibilities and work processes of units/offices, including decision-making processes, are clear and well documented for the majority of respondents. However, the organizational charts for the various entities made available for the present review differed in their presentation, and the Inspector suggests using a standard template for such purpose. The uploading of the annual workplan for each organizational structure, accompanied by indications of __________________ 19 See UNEP, \u201cStrengthened UNEP strategic regional presence: contributing to the future we want\u201d, policy paper (2015, internal document); and \u201cUN Environment\u2019s Country Presence Committee recommendations\u201d (2018, internal document). JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 14 25-10420 resource requirements for financial sustainability and risks to be managed towards meeting the entities\u2019 objectives, would further streamline and harmonize the approach, as well as enhancing internal knowledge transfer and coordination. 26. Observations regarding the structure. The Inspector does not intend to provide a detailed assessment of the organizational structure, as such an undertaking would require a comprehensive functional examination, but makes the following observations: (a) In recent years, several adjustments have been made to the organizational structure. The Science Division became the Early Warning and Assessment Division following restructuring in November 2023 and, in principle, will transition to the Division of Data, Applied Science and Analytics by August 2025 following a transfer of functions to other divisions and potential merging with the Chief Scientist\u2019s Office. The Climate Change Division was created in January 2024 from pertinent branches of the Ecosystems Division and the Industry and Economy Division. The coordination units overseeing the implementation of the portfolio funded by GEF and GCF were transferred from the Corporate Services Division to the Policy and Programme Division, and the Private Sector Unit based in the Partnerships and Resource Mobilization Branch of the Corporate Services Division was moved to the Industry and Economy Division. The rationale underpinning restructuring decisions are explained in memorandums issued by the Executive Director. UNEP management communicated that the most recent memorandums are available on an internal platform for information-sharing, and the Inspector looks forward to its continuous maintenance, including with updates of past relevant memorandums, and encourages enhancement of the internal visibility of this repository; (b) The placement of certain functions and/or separation of duties may need further consideration. The enterprise risk management function is currently linked to audit coordination under the Corporate Services Division.",

The enterprise risk management function is currently linked to audit coordination under the Corporate Services Division. Oversight responsibilities are split into several units within the Policy and Programme Division (project oversight) and the Corporate Services Division (corporate oversight) without a clear coordination mechanism. The strategic planning process, including indicator definition and monitoring and reporting, is split into different units of the Policy and Programme Division; (c) UNEP collaborates with a growing network of centres to complement and leverage its expertise. These entities are legally separate and distinct from UNEP and have generated certain issues in terms of their status and the rules governing their cooperation with the organization, as noted by the Board of Auditors in its report on the Fund of the United Nations Environment Programme for the year ended 31 December 2023.20 UNEP management conducted internal reviews on this matter in 2021 and 2023. At the time of the current review, the Legal Unit was reviewing the framework governing the operation of such centres and exploring potential paths forward. The Inspector urges UNEP management to conclude a review of the benefits and challenges associated with the centres collaborating with the organization and to clearly distinguish the legal status under which they operate, including the dimension of reputational risks. 27. Breaking through potential coordination silos. There are several institutional management mechanisms aimed at coordinating UNEP work, with the senior management team being the principal among them. Internal coordination remains an important feature of the organization, since UNEP is undertaking numerous initiatives and processes that require the involvement of numerous internal stakeholders. 21 In a __________________ 20 A/79/5/Add.7, chap. II. 21 For example, the Global Subprogramme Coordinators need to work together with the Directly Responsible Individuals of each programme coordination project, and the regional offices and the technical divisions co-create projects. JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 25-10420 15 formative evaluation conducted on the 2022 One UNEP delivery model, the UNEP Evaluation Office highlighted internal coordination as an area which deserved attention in the context of the delivery model and suggested, for example, to institutionalize a regular meeting between the Deputy Executive Director and the deputy directors of the headquarters divisions to support two-way informed dialogue.22 In addition, while all regional directors are part of the senior management team and several other management committees, the deputy regional directors come together only through informal and ad hoc meetings. From the Inspector\u2019s point of view, having a standardized practice of discussions among deputy regional directors would benefit the exchange of information within the organization. Additionally, while there is no shortage of information sources and internal platforms for exchanging information in UNEP, survey respondents and interviewees were only mildly satisfied about the coordination and cooperation within their own unit or office (see table 4). Coordination and cooperation among units and offices throughout UNEP was marked as a clear area for improvement: only one third of respondents indicated being satisfied with the current situation. Interestingly, the coordination gap seems to stem not from a lack of awareness regarding internal responsibilities, but rather from the organization\u2019s structure itself. That aspect was rated positively by only half of the respondents, with even lower approval among the secretariats of the multilateral environmental agreements. As regards practical improvements brought to internal coordination, the Inspector notes efforts made in recent years by UNEP management for promoting increased collaborative work across substantive units regarding the preparation of publications (technical reports, policy briefs and working papers).

B. Management framework 28. Overall regulatory framework. As part of the Secretariat of the United Nations, the strategies, policies and initiatives approved by the General Assembly and the directives of the Secretary-General are applicable to UNEP and to the secretariats of the UNEP-administered multilateral environmental agreements, unless the latter have developed their own non-conflicting policies and processes, as decided by their governing bodies. While compliance with United Nations Secretariat policies is __________________ 22 UNEP, Formative Evaluation of the UNEP Delivery Model and Associated Programmatic Approach (2024). JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 16 25-10420 acknowledged and upheld by UNEP management, the Inspector came across a few examples where the operationalization of these overarching policies raised some issues, which are further examined in the respective thematic chapters. A relatively common perception across the organization is that UNEP procedures impose certain additional and unnecessary checks and balances that are detrimental to the efficiency and effectiveness of the organization as a whole. As regards the secretariats of multilateral environmental agreements, the Inspector noted a recent initiative put forward by UNEP management to increase their involvement in the drafting of UNEP policies and/or procedures that may have an impact on their work, but the JIU survey addressed to the respective executive heads showed that there is still room for improvement in this regard. 29. Main components of the UNEP management framework. Since 2019, UNEP management has progressively reviewed and further developed the management framework of the organization. The UNEP Delegation of Authority Policy and Framework (2019) and the Policy for One UNEP Delivery for Better Collaboration and Country Support (2022) are components of the management framework, which also includes the UNEP Delegation of Authority Policy and Framework for the Management and Administration of Multilateral Environmental Agreement Secretariats (2021). Both UNEP delegation of authority frameworks were approved under the current Executive Director. Management committees 30. Management and thematic committees. At the time of the present review, UNEP had 10 different management or thematic committees.23 In this section, the Inspector focused on several executive management committees, while thematic committees are examined in other relevant parts of the report. The Inspector observed that, at the time of the review, all committees operated under defined terms of reference. In most cases, their records were properly maintained and made available through the weCollaborate platform, in line with users\u2019 access rights. However, the work of the thematic committees was relatively unclear for more than half of staff responding to the JIU survey, mostly among directors and international Professional staff. 31. Senior management team. The terms of reference of the senior management team were revised in February 2025, and restated its primary function to support the Executive Director in fulfilling her responsibilities for the strategic and operational leadership of the organization. As a good practice, some senior management team meetings are extended to include, among others, the heads of the secretariats of the UNEP-administered multilateral environmental agreements. These efforts should continue as cooperation between the heads of these secretariats and UNEP senior management was flagged as an area for potential improvement by the respondents to the questionnaire addressed to the former, for example by inviting them to UNEP executive-level retreats, as considered relevant.",

The content analysis of minutes of the weekly meetings of the senior management team from 2022 to 2024 indicate that the meetings serve as a channel for information on major thematic environmental issues, facilitate the review of UNEP engagement and participation in events, and address organizational management issues. However, the weekly meetings did not consistently serve as a forum for high-level strategic discussions following the presentation of the various topics (considerations that would be in line with the mandate of the committee), and this was suggested as a potential improvement by __________________ 23 The senior management team, the Budget Steering Committee, the Enterprise Risk Management Committee, the Concept Approval Group, the Project Review Committee, the Publications Board, the Publications Committee, the Partnership Committee, the ICT Solutions Group and the Data Governance Group.

A good practice identified is the issuance of key information such as an end-of-year summary, a workplan for the next cycle and the tracking of decisions reached by the team. The executive-level retreats, held between 2022 and 2025 on a biannual basis, were an opportunity for senior managers to deliberate on programmatic issues, progress towards achieving the strategic objectives of the organization or upcoming Environment Assembly meetings. The Inspector notes that while the decisions taken at those retreats were not included in the tracking system used for regular senior management team meetings, in 2023 and 2025 there was follow-up information from one retreat to the other regarding progress made on previously-agreed decisions. The Inspector encourages UNEP management to formalize and strengthen the process for decision-making during senior-level retreats, as well as the monitoring mechanism for and implementation of those decisions. Overall, the role of the team was acknowledged positively by nearly two thirds of the respondents to the JIU survey (see table 5). In addition, the team has two other important functions: it serves as the Publications Board, as further detailed in paragraph 116 below, and it brainstorms over figures gathered for the quarterly business review process, as commented on in paragraph 40 below.

Budget Steering Committee. The Budget Steering Committee was established in 2018, and its terms of reference of were revised in June 2024 to reaffirm its advisory role to the Executive Director on resource projection and the allocation and monitoring of utilization of resources primarily allocated to the funding of positions related to normative and core functions of the organization. The Committee holds sessions on resources made available from the regular budget and through the Environment Fund, and has separate meetings on resources from the Planetary Funds, which are allocated on an \u201cas received\u201d basis. 24 Noting that decisions and recommendations of the Committee are made by consensus, the Inspector makes the following observations: (a) The composition of the Committee is limited to the Deputy Executive Director (Chair), the Directors of the Corporate Services Division and the Policy and Programme Division, and the Chief of Staff. There is no representation of field entities or of multilateral environmental agreement secretariats. Such a composition is perceived by UNEP management as being conducive to a faster allocation process; however, the current structure of the Committee translates into having a restricted number of officials recommending the allocation of more than 20",

It also limits members\u2019 ability to recuse themselves from discussions __________________ 24 The financial framework of the organization is further examined in chapter IV of the present report. JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 18 25-10420 related to allocations within their own portfolios, as ensuring a quorum for decision- making remains essential. Nonetheless, the Inspector acknowledges that, for the first time, the decision on the allocation of resources for the year 2025 was communicated at the end of 2024. This is perceived as an achievement and as a clear improvement compared to previous years; (b) The objective stated in the Committee\u2019s terms of reference, which is to ensure efficient, effective, accountable and transparent utilization of resources, raised some comments across the organization. Various stakeholders largely viewed the process followed by the Committee as lacking sufficient consultation and transparency, while only 45 per cent of staff survey respondents indicated having a good level of understanding of the role, responsibilities and functioning of the Committee. Once an entity has submitted its budgetary requirements, further consultations on the rationale supporting the request rarely appear to be undertaken before a final allocation decision is made and communicated. Moreover, it appears that when such consultations and advocacy dialogues do take place, they are made in meetings outside the framework of the Committee. The criteria used for allocation have remained similar over the years and include factors such as proportional distribution according to the number of countries covered by a regional office or the historical allocations of programme support costs; as such, strategic considerations of interventions remain a secondary factor. The Inspector acknowledges a certain level of progress in this regard, as the allocation of programme support costs will no longer be made on the basis of historical trends but on needs analysis, as mentioned in the 2025 budget allocation memorandum of the Executive Director. Many respondents found the current templates for documenting resource requirements to be lacking in detail and considered the preparation time provided to be insufficient (10 days for the 2025 allocation exercise). The Inspector thus encourages UNEP management to plan and allow more time for the preparation and presentation of budgetary requests to the Committee. The Inspector notes that the terms of reference of the Committee were under revision at the time of the finalization of the report, with a view to integrating provisions on more frequent meetings of the Committee and increased interaction with UNEP divisions/offices; (c) The minutes of the Committee\u2019s meetings in 2023 and 2024 as reviewed by the Inspector included indications on recommendations for the abolishment and redeployment of staff positions funded by the Environment Fund and programme support costs for the upcoming year, but not their total number by division/office before and after such decisions. To increase transparency, the Inspector suggests adding such information to the meeting minutes. Furthermore, in cases of transfer of staff positions agreed during deliberations, the Inspector draws attention to the need for recording that the coherence between the funding source and the position after transfer has been considered. Accountability, internal control and delegation of authority 33. Accountability and internal control monitoring by the United Nations Secretariat. The accountability framework in the United Nations Secretariat approved by the General Assembly is applicable to UNEP.25 As indicated in a JIU report issued in 2023, UNEP management has not developed a tailored framework reflecting its accountability pillars specific to its business model.26 As regards internal control, since 2019, the Business Transformation and Accountability Division within the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance of the United Nations Secretariat monitors the compliance of United Nations entities under the purview of the Secretariat __________________ 25 See A/64/640 and General Assembly res",

These indicators are integrated into the review of effectiveness of the Secretariat\u2019s system of internal control, along with an internal control self-assessment questionnaire and assurance statement completed by heads of entities. The latest available statement is for 2023.27 As regards UNEP: (a) most indicators monitored by the Division reached their targets in 2023, with some of the ones linked to human resources requiring further attention; and (b) the 2023 internal control self-assessment questionnaire and assurance statement indicated adequate internal controls, although the delegation of authority and supply chain management were rated as \u201cneeds strengthening\u201d. 34. Three lines model. UNEP refers to the three lines model of the Institute of Internal Auditors as endorsed in 2014 by the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination (CEB), which is aimed at facilitating strong governance and risk management within organizations. 28 Beside UNEP management\u2019s self- assessment of the functioning of each of the three lines, which is presented in table 6, the Inspector draws attention to the following items that are further examined in the present report: (a) in relation to the first line, streamlining administrative processes and removing duplication of work should be considered, especially in three-tiered workflows involving divisions/offices, the Corporate Services Division and UNON (see paras. 47\u201353 below); and (b) in relation to the second line, the enterprise risk management processes, which are still in an emerging phase, require further strengthening (see paras. 90\u201394 below).

      "text": "controls. As regards the overarching organizational framework for internal control, in its response to the JIU questionnaire, UNEP management referred to the UNEP Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption Guidelines (2020) as the main reference document. The Inspector notes that the internal control framework is implemented in practice on the basis of numerous standard operating procedures and guidelines for each administrative area. The corresponding roles and functions for internal control purposes are defined and implemented in the relevant modules of Umoja. Strictly related to UNEP work in projects and programmes, the Projects Review and Oversight Unit within the Policy and Programme Division is responsible for reviewing project documentation, providing oversight and ensuring internal control at the project level. However, with only four Professional staff, two support staff and two affiliate personnel, it is not practically feasible for the team to provide sufficient assurance considering the number of projects covered (over 600 projects in 2024). Consequently, the team has to limit its actions to a documentary review and does not conduct on-the-spot verifications of implementing partners, which may represent a risk to the organization. In addition, the Unit serves as the secretariat for the Concept Approval Group and the Project Review Committee. 36. Delegation of authority framework. The portal on which all delegations of authority issued internally are made available is considered a good practice and could be enhanced in the future by the addition of periodic reports submitted by delegation holders. Analysing the portal, the Inspector notes the following: (a) there is a standard table with the areas for the delegation of authority from director level to P-5 level staff, but that table is not part of the policy framework; (b) the documentary review showed that compliance with the reporting requirements for the delegation holders is not pursued and monitored in a consistent manner; and (c) the delegation instruments uploaded to the portal for the Corporate Services Division are only related to financial certification matters. Regarding this last point, in the case that the portal is not up to date, the missing instruments should be added, as a priority. Otherwise, if this is the only type of delegation granted by the Director \u2013 who holds clearance responsibility for most administrative matters under the delegation of authority policy \u2013 the Inspector suggests that UNEP management review and confirm that the current level of authority delegated within the Corporate Services Division facilitate the most efficient and effective administrative processes. This is particularly important given that human resources and procurement were identified as areas needing improvement in the research conducted by JIU, as shown in table 8. 37. Time to review the delegation of authority policy framework. JIU analysis points to two major areas for attention: the update of the current delegation of authority policy framework, and the clarification of certain provisions within it. Although paragraph 39 of the policy highlights the difference between clearance and approval/authorization processes, the Inspector was provided with examples of situations that officials considered within their authority as delegation holders, but which had experienced delays due to additional ad hoc confirmation processes or had been withheld at the level of the Corporate Services Division, which was perceived as going beyond its attributed functions. Conversely, examples were provided suggesting that the provisions of the delegation of authority policy were not always strictly applied when clearance by the Corporate Services Division should be requested, for example, when engaging the organization in donor agreements under $1 million. The 2019 UNEP Delegation of Authority Policy and Framework was considered a living document, to be updated as necessary on the basis of identified gaps, lessons learned and frequently asked questions. 29 The Inspector notes that such a revision has not been undertaken and considers that the new delivery model __________________ 29 UNEP Delegation of Authority Policy and Framework (2019), para. 49.

In addition, concepts that are currently identified as being unclear should be better formulated and explained, such as the clearance process and situations where exceptions may be granted. 30 In March 2025, UNEP management communicated that a holistic review of the delegation of authority framework was foreseen in view of several practical updates made to the delegation instruments and their annexes since 2019. 38. The implementation of the following recommendation is expected to enhance transparency and accountability across the organization. Recommendation 2 The Executive Director should conclude, by the end of 2025, the review of the UNEP Delegation of Authority Policy and Framework and update it, as appropriate, in the context of the implementation of the Policy for One UNEP Delivery for Better Collaboration and Country Support. 39. Delegation of authority to the secretariats of the multilateral environmental agreements. Depending on their scope, global or regional, the secretariats of the UNEP-administered multilateral environmental agreements operate under different delegation of authority frameworks.31 On the basis of the JIU online questionnaire and interviews with secretariats of the multilateral environmental agreements, there is room for improvement of this framework to ensure arrangements that support clear decision-making authority, managerial autonomy and efficiency, as well as administrative effectiveness. Furthermore, in terms of the implementation of the rules, the secretariats reported that extra layers of verification were practiced by the UNEP secretariat in areas they considered to be within their delegated authority (for example in the recruitment of Professional positions up to the P-4 level). 40. Quarterly business review process. One of the main tools utilized by UNEP management as part of the approach to accountability and organizational monitoring is the process of quarterly business review, set up in 2022 to examine and assess the performance of divisions and offices. Distinct from external reporting, it is based on 13 predefined key performance indicators assigned to various areas (project implementation, human resources, funds utilization, donor and implementing partner management, and evaluation, audit and air travel compliance) and one composite index. The targets for these indicators are set by the Executive Office in consultation with the Directors of the Policy and Programme Division and the Corporate Services Division, as pertinent. Indicator dashboards are subsequently presented in senior management team meetings. The figures for the last quarter of 2024 showed that while set targets in terms of human resources metrics had been achieved, more attention was needed for increasing the implementation rate of projects. In addition, the Policy and Programme Division shares a monthly version with the head(s) of each division and office to facilitate monitoring in real time. The Inspector commends the process as being valuable for having a regular overview of the main functions and administrative aspects and a basis for the exchange of opportunities, challenges, good practices, __________________ 30 UNEP, \u201cUNEP Delivery Model: Policy for One UNEP Delivery for Better Collaboration and Country Support\u201d (2022), annex 4: Accountability across different roles and responsibilities. 31 UNEP Delegation of Authority Policy and Framework (2019) for regional seas and other regional multilateral environmental agreement secretariats, and UNEP Delegation of Authority Policy and Framework for the Management and Administration of Multilateral Environmental Agreement Secretariats (2021) for global multilateral environmental agreement secretariats.

      "text": "levance. 2022 delivery model 41. Shift in operations. The Policy for One UNEP Delivery for Better Collaboration and Country Support is a major initiative in recent years which has redefined the roles and responsibilities of regional directors, directors of technical divisions and Global Subprogramme Coordinators, as well as their related accountability. There is a consensus across the organization that the 2022 delivery model represents a significant operational shift for the organization as compared to the previous framework guiding its field presence and business model. This shift refers in particular to the redistribution of: (a) accountability for programmatic implementation roles; and (b) responsibilities between regional offices and technical divisions. The vision of the model is that regional offices serve as representatives engaging with national authorities and providing strategic consultation to align the work of UNEP with regional and national priorities. Meanwhile, divisions contribute thematic expertise, ensuring coherence and technical depth, and are directly responsible for implementing projects, monitoring progress and reporting. The \u201cco-creation\u201d notion thus emerged. 42. Challenges in implementing the delivery model. The rationale for the initiative, stated as advancing the environment agenda in the context of the United Nations reform process by enhancing the effectiveness of regional offices in the strategic and operational engagement of UNEP with resident coordinators and the United Nations country teams, is well supported across the organization. However, the lack of guidance on its implementation and the absence of a monitoring framework raised concerns among many interviewees. In this regard, several concerns were highlighted during the preparation of the review, including the following: (a) The lack of practical implementation guidelines led to different interpretations of the model\u2019s application across divisions and offices: for example, the co-creation concept between the divisions and the regional offices is at times understood as consultation and at other times as actual involvement in drafting project documentation; (b) The change management process was not accompanied by an action plan or gradual roll-out, which led to the implementation of the model without a sufficient adjustment of staff functions and/or reconversion of staff skills, particularly in the regions; (c) The resource mobilization function of the regional offices can potentially be delayed, as the regional level needs confirmation from the divisional level before entering into any donor agreement, and, thereafter, a subsequent confirmation from regional offices to divisions is needed before any project concept notes can be put forward. 43. Interdivisional and interregional collaboration as areas for improvement. The review indicates that representatives from both regional offices and technical divisions share these concerns, and that the current delivery model is not seen as having fostered sufficient interdivisional and interregional collaboration. These findings are also supported by staff feedback (see table 7), where only 33 per cent saw the 2022 model as adding value to the organization, and by responses from heads of field offices, half of whom viewed the model as bringing limited contribution to the organization\u2019s efficiency and effectiveness.

UNEP formative evaluation of the delivery model. Some of these concerns were also brought forward by the formative evaluation conducted in 2024 by the UNEP Evaluation Office. The report outlined findings and conclusions that suggested that: (a) the implementation of the delivery model would have benefited from a change management plan; (b) an explanation and exchange of views with staff on how to operationalize the split in responsibilities between regional offices and technical divisions would have been needed; (c) the model is internally-oriented and should be reviewed with a view to integrating the approach of the partnership policy, approved in 2024; and (d) the expected results and impact of the model are not evident from the document.",

Furthermore, the evaluation addresses issues of broader interest than the delivery model itself and draws attention to a series of other corporate challenges, for example: (a) clarifying the focus and work structure of the Concept Approval Group; (b) defining an organizational mechanism for phasing out lower-priority projects and workstreams; (c) defining a unified organizational approach to knowledge management and information-sharing across the organization; (d) defining the causal relationships between programme coordination project outcomes and the medium- term strategy objectives; (e) clearly distinguishing responsibilities between Global Subprogramme Coordinators and Directly Responsible Individuals of programme coordination projects; and (f) clarifying the allocation principles among divisions for the Planetary Funds. Most of these topics are further analysed in the present review under the relevant chapters. The Inspector learned that UNEP management intends to set up two workstreams to consider the recommendations contained in the evaluation, with one working group focusing on the implementation of the delivery model and another reflecting on corporate challenges. The Inspector is looking forward to the management response to the formative evaluation. 45. Monitoring framework for the delivery model. The Inspector underlines the lack of a monitoring framework for the delivery model, which makes it difficult to quantify whether UNEP has progressed towards achieving its intended results. The development of guidance for implementation of the delivery model and a monitoring framework for it is required and should factor in the human resources aspect, including corresponding functional reconversion or skills development. Such a guidance document should also provide explanations on how the co-creation process between technical divisions and regional offices is expected to be organized in practice, both at the concept development and the project documentation drafting levels. Such a monitoring framework should provide the basis for reporting on the results of the implementation of the delivery model to the Committee of Permanent Representatives. 46.

Recommendation 4 The Committee of Permanent Representatives should request the Executive Director to present in 2026 a monitoring framework for the Policy for One UNEP Delivery for Better Collaboration and Country Support that would enable the assessment of progress against expected results. C. Administrative services 47. United Nations Office at Nairobi. In accordance with UNEP Governing Council decision 18/43, the attachment of administrative and conference services staff of UNEP to UNON was approved in 1995. Since then, the UNEP secretariat has relied on UNON for most of its business operations and conference services. Most recently, these services are provisioned in the memorandum of understanding signed in 2017 by the two entities, which covers financial services, human resources management services, central support services and procurement. 32 This agreement is operationalized by a service level agreement (2018) indicating the costs by service category, the description of the service, the duties and responsibilities of each party and related performance indicators. In its response to the JIU questionnaire, UNEP management, while acknowledging the constraints faced by UNON in certain areas, stated overall satisfaction regarding the service arrangements, but marked human resources services, procurement and relations with the host country as areas requiring improvement (see figure III).

Administrative processes in UNEP. UNEP procedures and guidelines and their efficient implementation received low ratings from most respondents to JIU surveys (see table 8). Both the clarity of the guidelines and their efficient implementation scored low, with the latter being an issue particularly in the areas of human resources management, financial management and procurement. These areas scored even lower among respondents from the secretariats of multilateral environmental agreements. Views provided by the affiliate workforce mirror this negative perception.

Common back office initiative in Kenya. While acknowledging the status UNON as a global service provider, in May 2025 UNEP and UNON signed an amendment to the 2017 memorandum of understanding following the implementation of the common back office initiative in Kenya, which was launched in 2024. However, several UNEP officials perceived that the expansion of the initiative to other United Nations entities based in Kenya may have affected the focus on the organization\u2019s singular needs. To mitigate that perception, UNON reported the creation of dedicated teams for reaffirming the focus on and engagement with their main clients: UNEP, UN-Habitat and the Resident Coordinator Office. Those teams cover support services for budget and financial management, human resources management and procurement services, and can be seen as a good practice. 50. Challenges regarding the three-tiered model for support services. It is important to clarify that most of these support services are in fact integrated processes and involve UNON, the UNEP Corporate Services Division and administrative and financial teams in other UNEP divisions and offices which are also responsible for certain steps in the processes, hence functioning as a three-tiered model for support services. In this context, where both UNEP and UNON are involved in different stages of administrative processes, the Inspector acknowledges certain obstacles to an informed and actionable assessment of services. Despite the information that distinguishes the prerequisite actions (UNEP) and the performance indicators (UNON) in the service level agreement, both UNEP and UNON stakeholders found it challenging to properly implement actions within such integrated end-to-end processes. At the time of the finalization of the present report, the Inspector was informed that, as part of the UN80 Initiative, a United Nations Secretariat-led working group was developing a proposal for a framework that reorganizes management and JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 26 25-10420 administrative structures into common administrative platforms meant to consolidate existing administrative capacities, with Nairobi",

While awaiting the outcomes of the working group, the Inspector suggests reviewing the current process architecture for each service to ensure that the information and expectations are clearly presented on both sides, which is expected to lead to an improvement of the client-user relations and ultimately of the delivery of services. 51. Performance measurement and reporting of UNON services. The governance arrangements for common services are articulated on two levels (the Common Services Board and the Common Services Management Team), in which UNEP management stated its active participation. In terms of key performance indicators, the memorandum of understanding indicates the obligation of UNON to publish a biannual report assessing how key performance indicators are met and where discrepancies are found. In addition, indicator dashboards are produced and discussed on a quarterly basis, during the meetings of the Common Services Board. It should be noted that targets of performance indicators defined for UNON services are set by type of services and are identical for all its clients. UNEP officials indicated that merely reaching these common targets is not always adequate, considering the operational requirements of their organization, and suggested the possibility of having tailored targets for each client. The Inspector notes the actions undertaken for setting up a channel of communication between the UNEP and UNON executive offices that would complement the current governance arrangements for periodically addressing emerging issues and potential solutions. 52. Other administrative service providers. Other United Nations entities provide administrative support services to UNEP at the headquarters, regional and country levels. These include the United Nations Office at Geneva, UNOPS, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and several United Nations regional commissions. For example, the United Nations Office at Geneva is providing some services for the Europe-based UNEP offices, including travel services and the issuance of United Nations laissez-passer. UNEP has an agreement with UNOPS for specialized human resources services, which UNEP sees as having improved operational efficiency in the recruitment and management of project personnel. 33 The Inspector notes an ongoing review of the global support services framework agreement signed with UNOPS in 2022 to reflect the updated needs of UNEP. The organization also uses the services of UNDP on the basis of its catalogue of services. 53. Corporate services in UNEP. Under the common back office arrangements, the administrative processes are divided between UNEP and UNON, as outlined above. The review also highlights the presence of administrative and financial units in various divisions, offices and regional offices of UNEP which exist in addition to the counterpart functions within the Corporate Services Division. These units report to the director or the deputy director of their respective entities and are mostly staffed with Professional and General Service staff and sometimes affiliate personnel. While it is not unusual to have such capacity to support the work of the main corporate entity for administrative and financial matters, this arrangement is considered by many internal stakeholders as adding to the complexity of related processes. The three- tiered model in place (administrative units, the Corporate Services Division, and UNON or other administrative service providers) involves at times stakeholders from different locations and time zones (UNON, secretariats of global and regional environmental agreements, and UNEP outposted branches), which can hamper the swiftness of workflows.

JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 25-10420 27 administrative and financial teams/units in UNEP and the Corporate Services Division were signalled as a challenge in this context. Furthermore, the JIU staff survey indicates that less than 60 per cent of respondents understand the involvement of UNON in the provision of support services. The figures are significantly lower for respondents from the secretariats of multilateral environmental agreements, which points to a need for implementing awareness-raising actions on the topic. In this context, the Inspector suggests an internal functional review of administrative and financial processes and the division of labour between the UNEP Corporate Services Division and administrative and financial units in other divisions or offices. The aim of such a review should be to ensure clear lines of responsibilities and accountability and an efficient and effective operating framework, allowing the Corporate Services Division to guide the consistent and coherent implementation of these processes and integration with UNON. In this regard, the Inspector welcomes the announcement by the Executive Director in March 2025 of a comprehensive initiative for an organizational functional review of UNEP and looks forward to the integration of the above-mentioned elements in the scope of the exercise. 54. UNEP support to the secretariats of multilateral environmental agreements. The basis for the provision of administrative and financial management support services to the secretariats of UNEP-administered multilateral environmental agreements lies in a series of documents of various legal nature. 34 Two thirds of the respondents to the JIU questionnaire addressed to the secretariats of multilateral environmental agreements found the current arrangements effective or very effective, keeping in mind that these secretariats also have their own established administrative and financial teams. The fact that they are being provided with services from various United Nations entities from different locations does not seem to create problems, as the distribution of tasks at the process level was deemed to be clear. However, only half the respondents found these arrangements to be the most efficient solution in terms of quality, time and cost, indicating that there is room for improvement in terms of service coordination and streamlining. Indeed, UNEP management has undertaken several initiatives in that regard in the recent past, promoting more engagement. 55. Advisory Service Unit for the multilateral environmental agreements. Within the Corporate Services Division, a dedicated Advisory Service Unit to support the secretariats of the multilateral environmental agreements was established in 2018, and was initially focused on financial services. As part of a global effort towards more engagement with these secretariats, the scope of the Unit expanded to a wider range of services, facilitating coordination and support on financial services, policy guidance, human resources management, legal support and other service categories, therefore creating a platform for better interactions. As regards the assessment and review of services provided by UNEP to the secretariats of multilateral environmental agreements, the Inspector found that, apart from reports on administrative and financial management support presented by the UNEP Executive Director to their respective governing bodies, as relevant, only a few other assessment mechanisms exist. Additionally, these governing bodies have rarely used the possibility of bringing to the attention of the UNEP Executive Director any administrative or financial challenges faced following the practical implementation of their respective __________________ 34 The 2018 UNEP Corporate Services Division memorandum on the provision of secretariat services to multilateral environmental agreements and other entities listed describes the services provided to all secretariats.

JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 28 25-10420 memorandum of understanding as foreseen by the Environment Assembly. 35 This is an area of attention given the lack of a consistent approach to the assessment of services provided by the UNEP secretariat and because, where such mechanisms do exist, they were perceived as not having led to sufficient adjustments. Nonetheless, the services of the Unit were acknowledged as effective in the JIU questionnaire addressed to the secretariats. Furthermore, in 2024, the Deputy Executive Director issued a memorandum on strengthening support and interactions with the secretariats on management and administrative issues affecting them, which was updated in April 2025. 36 To follow-up on that memorandum, the Inspector suggests having measures to track how that document is implemented in practice, in order to identify the outcomes of the consultation process and lessons learned. IV. Financial framework A. Funding model 56. Overall. UNEP follows two budgetary processes with distinct periodicity and covering different funding sources: a yearly cycle, captured in the programme budget of the United Nations (section 14, referencing both regular budget requirements and estimates for extrabudgetary contributions), which is adopted by the General Assembly, and a biennial cycle for voluntary contributions required for UNEP to implement its programme of work adopted by the Environment Assembly as the programme of work and budget. In accordance with the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations, both documents should be subject to review by the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions before adoption by the respective governing bodies. 37 The Inspector notes, however, that since 2018\u2013 2019 there has been an absence of compliance with this procedure, specifically for the programme of work and budget documents. As a result, these documents covering subsequent bienniums were submitted for approval by the Environment Assembly without prior review and comment by the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions. The non-compliance is acknowledged by UNEP management, and the Inspector was made aware that measures have been initiated to correct the situation, starting in the 2026\u20132027 cycle, to conform to existing procedures. However, the pertinence of this arrangement could be examined in terms of costs and value added, since the Advisory Committee already provides its remarks annually on section 14 of the proposed programme budget, dealing specifically with environmental matters, which includes information on both regular and voluntary contributions as well as a plan for the activities of UNEP for the year to come. 57. Unusual extension of the time frame covered by the programme of work and budget. In its decision 5/4, adopted in 2022, the Environment Assembly decided to extend the validity of the programme of work and budget agreed for the period 2022\u20132023 by two years, to the end of 2025, with the budget and targets being prorated accordingly. 38 Such an extension is not the standard practice and, while several reasons underpinning it were communicated to the Inspector, the research shows that the rationale for the decision is not explained in the Environment Assembly decision. This meant that the representatives of Member States provided formal inputs only once in four years on the operative directions and budget of the secretariat, a __________________ 35 UNEP/EA.1/INF/8 (2014); and United Nations Environment Assembly resolution 2/18 (2016). 36 Memorandum dated 27 August 2024 on consulting UNEP-administered multilateral environmental agreement secretariats on UNEP corporate policies of programmatic and administrative relevance (reissued on 1 April 2025, internal document). 37 ST/SGB/2015/4, rule 204.2. 38 United Nations Environment Assembly decision 5/4, para. 13, and UNEP/EA.6/13.

JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 25-10420 29 situation which generated a certain discontent among those interviewed by the Inspector. Taking note of the interest expressed by representatives of Member States during interviews to be consulted on budgetary matters, not only at the level of the Environment Assembly but also at the level of the Committee of Permanent Representatives, the Inspector recommends caution with such an approach and avoiding it in the future, as Member States should discuss and adopt distinct programmes of work and budget documents for each biennium, properly reflecting necessary strategic and budgetary shifts at the midpoint in the implementation of midterm strategies. 58. Budget versus income. The UNEP budget and subsequently its income comprise regular budget and extrabudgetary resources. While the regular budget is based on assessed contributions from Member States, the extrabudgetary component of the resources includes voluntary contributions labelled as core contributions to the Environment Fund and earmarked resources which are divided into \u201csoftly earmarked\u201d funds (such as the Planetary Funds) and \u201ctightly earmarked\u201d funds (project-assigned by donors or through global funds mechanisms). 39 Figure IV presents the evolution of the main categories of income sources since 2012, which, over the years, have grown substantially. While the regular budget and the Environment Fund have remained stable, the increase is mostly attributable to surges in either earmarked contributions or resources pertaining to the global funds. The UNEP budget for the 2022\u20132023 biennium was $872.9 million, which was replicated, as explained above, for the 2024\u20132025 period. For 2022\u20132023, income reached $1.35 billion. While keeping in mind that multi-year commitments are registered as income for the year in which they are confirmed, the Inspector notes that UNEP income in 2022\u20132023 surpassed the forecasted budget by more than 50 per cent, due to higher revenues from earmarked funds.

Core and non-core funds. A different terminology (core and non-core funds) is used by UNEP in its financial reporting, depending on the nature of operations for which the funds are used. Assessed contributions, contributions to the Environment Fund and a certain percentage of earmarked funds (i.e. programme support costs) represent core funding subject to allocation decisions by UNEP management. The remaining voluntary contributions (earmarked funds and global funds) are non-core funds assigned to specific projects, with therefore limited discretion of UNEP management towards their use, the only exceptions being the resources gathered by the three Planetary Funds and the programme cooperation agreement with the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency at the thematic level, which are allocated on the basis of UNEP management decisions. In 2022\u20132023, 16 per cent of UNEP resources core and 84 per cent were non-core; that proportion was not in line with the target adopted for the United Nations system under the funding compact for the period 2019\u20132023, by which Member States committed to ensure predictable and flexible funding for United Nations activities at a level of at least 30 per cent. 40 As of 2024, the target for the proportion is no longer quantified, but the new funding compact calls for increased core resources.41 The challenges related to the financial framework in which UNEP operates have been identified over the years and impose certain constraints and risks for the management of the organization, as further examined in chapter V.",

To address the risks posed by the funding model, UNEP management has launched several initiatives as mitigation measures, such as strengthening the application of the voluntary scale of contributions, and the Planetary Funds, which are analysed in the paragraphs below. 60. Assessed contributions provide marginal funding. In the 2022\u20132023 biennium, assessed contributions from the regular budget represented 5 per cent of the UNEP budget and around 3 per cent of its annual income, while 97 per cent originated from extrabudgetary resources. In nominal terms, the income from assessed resources has almost tripled, from $15.9 million in 2012\u20132013 to $47.1 million in 2022\u20132023, but their relative proportion to the total resources has declined with the expansion of UNEP activities over the years and the increase in voluntary contributions. 61. Establishment and purpose of the Environment Fund. The Environment Fund was established in 1973 by the General Assembly. Initially, Member States informally discussed the level of the Fund, which was expected to reach $100 million per year, but its first approved budget was $5.5 million.42 The Environment Fund, currently approved by the Environment Assembly at $100 million per year, accounts for approximately 20 per cent of the UNEP annual budget (15 per cent of its income). However, the Inspector notes with concern that the Fund has never reached its approved amount, and, for example, the paid contributions were short by $10 million in 2023 and 2024. This is a well-known situation as UNEP management provides information on the status of the Fund at each meeting of the Committee of Permanent Representatives and at its annual subcommittees as well as through regular email circulars. Also, the fact that online information is available to Member States indicating in real time the status of the contributions to the Fund to keep them informed is a good practice observed by the Inspector. The expected amount of the Fund has not been adjusted for inflation over the years, corresponding to a decrease of resources in real terms, as the Executive Director stated in her opening speech at the 164th meeting of the Committee of Permanent Representatives, in 2024, underlining the fact that the current adjusted value of the Fund __________________ 40 A/74/73/Add.1-E/2019/14/Add.1, para. 18, and General Assembly resolution 72/279, para. 25. 41 United Nations Sustainable Development Group, \u201cFunding compact for the United Nations\u2019 support to the Sustainable Development Goals\u201d (May 2024). 42 Discussed and proposed by one delegation during the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held in Stockholm in 1972; see Governing Council decision 3 (I) (1973). JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 25-10420 31 should reach more than $700 million.43 In this context, the Inspector recalls paragraph 15 of decision 5/2 of the Environment Assembly, adopted in 2021, in which the Assembly \u201curged all Member States and others in a position to do so to increase voluntary contributions to the United Nations Environment Programme, notably the Environment Fund\u201d. While being an extrabudgetary funding source, the Environment Fund is acknowledged by internal stakeholders as the main source of the flexible funding stream (core contributions) provided by Member States to enable UNEP management to ensure the strategic and effective delivery of results with a certain level of flexibility. The Inspector notes that, over the years, an increasing portion of the Environment Fund has been directed towards staffing needs, with nearly 80 per cent of the Fund allocated to human resources in 2024. 62. Voluntary indicative scale of contributions. In 2002, the predecessor of the Environment Assembly endorsed a voluntary indicative scale of contributions for the Environment Fund by which each Member State is encouraged to contribute a percentage of the agreed amount of the Fund.44 The expected contributions are based on a formula that includes variables such as the scale of assessments used for the United Nations regular budget, the previous contributions to the Fund and a set of macroeconomic indicators.",

In 2002, the predecessor of the Environment Assembly endorsed a voluntary indicative scale of contributions for the Environment Fund by which each Member State is encouraged to contribute a percentage of the agreed amount of the Fund.44 The expected contributions are based on a formula that includes variables such as the scale of assessments used for the United Nations regular budget, the previous contributions to the Fund and a set of macroeconomic indicators. 45 JIU underlined the potential of such an approach in 2007 in terms of addressing issues regarding the predictability and adequacy of resources.46 However, the implementation of this model over the years has shown that, in practice, it is highly dependent on a limited number of contributors. One possible explanation arising from a 2020 survey of Member States conducted by UNEP management is that the formula applied to calculate the expected contributions is perceived as not sufficiently factoring in the economic situation of countries. Unfortunately, it was not possible to confirm that hypothesis in the preparation of the present review due to insufficient replies from representatives of Member States to the JIU surveys. In addition, the Inspector observed an inconsistency between the sum of expected contributions of Member States according to the established voluntary scale and the yearly budgeted amount of the Environment Fund (see figure V), acknowledging the UNEP management reply, according to which the scale is designated as a guidance tool, not a strict funding cap, and represents the amount each Member State is encouraged to contribute. 63. Funding base remains fragile. It is positive to note that the number of Member States contributing their full share to the Environment Fund has increased steadily following outreach efforts by UNEP management during meetings of governing bodies as well as bilaterally. By the end of 2024, 94 Member States had contributed to the Environment Fund, but only 48 with the full amount of their expected contribution.47 Despite this upward trajectory, the Inspector observed that more than half of Member States did not make any contribution to the Environment Fund in any given year. The analysis shows that most contributors are accredited to the Committee of Permanent Representatives, which confirms the importance of UNEP efforts for increasing the number of accredited Member States, which can ultimately have a positive impact on the collected contributions to the Environment Fund (see figure V). __________________ 43 See https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/speech/turning-corner-environmental-crises-2024. 44 See UNEP/GCSS.VII/6, annex I, Governing Council decision SS.VII/1, in which the Council endorsed the proposal contained in the report of the Open-ended Intergovernmental Group of Ministers or Their Representatives on International Environmental Governance. Among its recommendations, the Open-ended Intergovernmental Group proposed the development of a voluntary indicative scale of contributions for the Environment Fund in order to broaden the base of contributions and enhance predictability in the voluntary financing of the Fund (see section III.B of the appendix to the decision). 45 UNEP/EA.4/INF/11. 46 JIU/REP/2007/1. 47 By the end of April 2025, 101 Member States had contributed to the 2024 budget of the Environment Fund, with 62 having contributed their full expected amount. JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 32 25-10420 It is also important to mention that within the pool of contributors the base remains fragile, as 10 contributors provided around 75 per cent of the Fund income in 2024, even if those donors have a long-standing commitment to the environmental agenda. It is positive to record that non-traditional donors have recently contributed to the Fund, the latter having reached its highest level in 2023.

Increase in voluntary contributions. The global focus on the environment has attracted increased resources over the years, with sustained commitments from multiple donors. The increase in earmarked contributions has been significant, from $171.8 million in 2012 to $281.8 million in 2024 (see figure IV), but caution should be given to the current international context and to the fact that this category of resources remains unpredictable and lacks flexibility when funds are tightly earmarked.",

The global focus on the environment has attracted increased resources over the years, with sustained commitments from multiple donors. The increase in earmarked contributions has been significant, from $171.8 million in 2012 to $281.8 million in 2024 (see figure IV), but caution should be given to the current international context and to the fact that this category of resources remains unpredictable and lacks flexibility when funds are tightly earmarked. In its response to the JIU questionnaire, UNEP management considered that, despite economic challenges straining donor financing capabilities, the awareness of climate change, nature and biodiversity loss and chemicals and pollution issues is likely to prompt Governments and organizations to prioritize funding for environmental initiatives, such as those pioneered by the organization. As highlighted by a survey conducted by UNEP management,48 the possibilities for demonstrating support to a specific environmental challenge and for funding activities and programmes directly aligned with national priorities are key considerations for Member States when allocating earmarked funds. In this context, it is important for the organization to carry out regular assessments to verify whether activities funded through earmarked contributions also remain fully aligned with the global priorities and strategic focus of UNEP, as expressed in its medium-term strategies. The Inspector welcomes the attention given to this topic by the Executive Director in the town hall meeting of February 2025 and recalls the suggestion made in the formative evaluation __________________ 48 UNEP/ASC.7/2/Add.4. 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Number of Member States Millions of United States dollars Total amount of expected contributions in line with the voluntary indicative scale of contributions Contributions of Member States accredited to the Committee of Permanent Representatives Environment Fund approved amount Number of Member States accredited to the Committee of Permanent Representatives JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 25-10420 33 of the delivery model to approach earmarked projects with an integrated view for ensuring long-term sustainability and impacts, as opposed to individual one-off interventions. 65. Planetary Funds. In 2022, UNEP management established a series of trust funds, referred to as the Planetary Funds, with the objective of progressively transitioning the organization\u2019s traditional earmarked funding model based on individual projects to softly earmarked funds, which are to be assigned by donors at the level of broader thematic areas. According to UNEP management, the establishment of a separate trust fund for each of the three planetary environmental crises (climate change, pollution and waste, and nature and biodiversity loss) represented a significant step towards streamlining the funding model. It was expected that this would bring efficiency gains by: (a) having more flexibility in the use of funds; (b) reducing the number of existing trust funds; and (c) lightening reporting mechanisms while still meeting donors\u2019 requirements. The Inspector acknowledges the outreach efforts undertaken by UNEP management for promoting these Funds and their rationale and purpose through a dedicated campaign, brochure and website. The Planetary Funds are beginning to attract more funding, from $9 million in 2023 to $30 million at the end of 2024. However, despite UNEP outreach initiatives, only five countries contributed to the Funds in 2023 and 2024. As in the case of the Environment Fund, the Planetary Funds have a high level of dependency on a limited number of donors (one country accounted for 55 per cent of contributions in the period 2023\u20132024). In this context, at the request of UNEP management, the United Nations Controller granted a waiver from the 13 per cent standard programme support costs rate (applied to project-related earmarked funds) down to 10 per cent in order to further encourage contributions to the Planetary Funds. However, since reporting is done at the overall fund level rather than by individual donor contributions, this can be potentially disincentivizing since contributors can less readily pinpoint projects linked to their funding and must accept being part of integrated results streams. Initially, the Planetary Funds had their own governance structure for allocating resources across the organization. It is positive to note that a more holistic approach has been followed since 2024, and the Budget Steering Committee is now responsible for recommending allocations of resources arising from this funding stream.",

In this context, UNEP management aims to prioritize such resources for activities that can help to generate confidence among donors, who can ultimately contribute more pledged resources. 66. High financial dependency on one global funds mechanism. GEF accounted for 38 per cent of UNEP income in the 2022\u20132023 biennium, with more than $514 million, channelled exclusively through earmarked funds, while GCF accounted for 3 per cent of the income ($44 million). 49 These amounts have been gradually increasing, as seen in figure IV. Similar to the logic of programme support costs, the financial engagement with GEF and GCF integrates a fee-based model retained by UNEP, which is calculated as a percentage of the total budget of assigned projects. One particularity of GEF is the double role that UNEP can play in spending the funds __________________ 49 GEF and GCF are multilateral funds providing grants and blended finance to projects addressing environmental issues. Both run in four-year budgetary cycles, with GEF being in its eighth cycle and GCF in its second one. A total of 29 Member States contribute to GEF, which has an estimated budget of $5.33 billion for the period 2022\u20132026. As regards GCF, 31 countries pledged $12.8 billion in funding for the period 2024\u20132027. UNEP is one of the GEF implementing agencies (other United Nations entities acting as implementing agencies for GEF are the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, UNDP and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization). UNEP holds the status of accredited entity for GCF, alongside 138 other organizations, and is tasked with working with countries to develop funding proposals and ensure the management and monitoring of projects and programmes. JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 34 25-10420 as: (a) implementing agency providing support and guidance to countries for projects delivered mostly through implementing partners; and (b) executing agency taking care of and responsible for the actual delivery of the project. During the sixth session of the Environment Assembly, Member States requested UNEP management to strengthen the role the organization plays as implementing agency, and that request was taken up and further detailed in the Executive Director\u2019s memorandum on the topic from July 2024.50 Nonetheless, the high financial dependency on such a tightly earmarked funding stream may pose risks for the organization\u2019s financial management and strategic focus. The Inspector suggests that UNEP management undertake an analysis to determine the most appropriate funding proportion from global funds mechanisms that would mitigate the dependency risks for the organization. 67. Satisfactory interactions and working relationships with the global funds mechanisms. To maintain the role of implementing agency with GEF, UNEP management needs to assess itself once per cycle (every four years) against the GEF fiduciary standards.51 No major issues were highlighted in the latest assessment of this kind. As regards GCF, the accreditation is valid for five years, during which UNEP management needs to: (a) submit an annual standardized report on self- assessment of compliance with the GCF standards; (b) undergo a midterm review carried out by the GCF secretariat; and (c) participate in ad hoc compliance reviews. The most recent midterm review took place in 2022, following which UNEP was reaccredited without any conditions and upgraded to manage medium-sized projects (up to $250 million). For that review, the Inspector spoke to panels of experts and senior managers from both GEF and GCF, and while the relations with UNEP were found to be satisfactory, room for improvement was mentioned regarding reporting and project implementation pace. More recently, the Inspector notes Environment Assembly resolution 6/2 and the internal memorandum from the Executive Director (July 2024) aimed at reducing the direct execution by UNEP of GEF projects and maintaining a clear line of accountability within the organization. In this context, an update of the relevant internal operational guidelines, currently dating back to 2012, seems necessary.52 68.",

      "text": "or managers from both GEF and GCF, and while the relations with UNEP were found to be satisfactory, room for improvement was mentioned regarding reporting and project implementation pace. More recently, the Inspector notes Environment Assembly resolution 6/2 and the internal memorandum from the Executive Director (July 2024) aimed at reducing the direct execution by UNEP of GEF projects and maintaining a clear line of accountability within the organization. In this context, an update of the relevant internal operational guidelines, currently dating back to 2012, seems necessary.52 68. Programme support costs. The relevant United Nations Secretariat guidelines have been operationalized by UNEP management through the standard management procedure on programme support costs (2017).53 In 2024, discussions of the senior management team highlighted the need to update this internal procedure; however, the review was delayed and is now expected by the end of 2025. This is an important development to follow and finalize before the 2026 budgetary cycle as programme support costs constitute an important funding source for staff positions (in the case of the Corporate Services Division, more than 70 per cent). While the scope of the present review does not include a detailed assessment of programme support costs, as this constitutes the subject of a system-wide review included in the JIU programme of work for 2025,54 the Inspector draws attention to the following points: (a) With the implementation of the 2022 delivery model, the cost centres for projects funded from extrabudgetary resources moved from regional offices to __________________ 50 United Nations Environment Assembly resolution 6/2; and internal memorandum from the Executive Director (July 2024) aimed at reducing the direct execution by UNEP of GEF projects and maintaining a clear line of accountability within the organization. 51 GEF, \u201cPolicy on minimum fiduciary standards\u201d, policy No. GA/PL/02 (2019). 52 UNEP, \u201cOperational guidelines for implementing the accountability framework for internally executed GEF projects\u201d (2012, internal document). 53 UNEP, \u201cProgramme support cost & budget: standard management procedure\u201d (2017, internal document). 54 That is, the review of the policies and practices for determining the rates of programme support costs in organizations of the United Nations system. JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 25-10420 35 technical divisions, with implications for the staffing of regional offices previously subsidized by this source. In response, regional management projects were developed and implemented by regional offices through surge funds as a temporary solution for resourcing the office, which may pose sustainability risks if resource constraints are not addressed. In 2023, the Budget Steering Committee touched upon the issue in its deliberations, but concrete results have yet to be achieved; (b) As explained in the minutes of a Budget Steering Committee meeting, 55 while global funds are functioning on a fee-based model and not contributing as such to the budget of programme support costs (generally used for staffing administrative support functions), they nonetheless exert pressure on the corporate structure as project implementation requires support from the Corporate Services Division and from other units within the Policy and Programme Division, beyond the support provided by the dedicated GEF and GCF coordination units. This fact should be considered in the review suggested in paragraph 53 above; (c) The United Nations Controller granted a series of waivers from the standard 13 per cent programme support costs for the Planetary Funds, the funds received from the European Commission and a few other individual cases upon specific request and justification from UNEP management; (d) In relation to the secretariats of the UNEP-administered multilateral environmental agreements, programme support costs charged by the UNEP secretariat for providing administrative and financial support are grouped with other sources of programme support costs and then used as a holistic funding source for staff positions or other activities. This approach creates discontent among some of the supported secretariats, which questioned during interviews and in their responses to the JIU questionnaire the transparency of the approach and the fact that it limits the possibility of verifying whether the programme support costs charged by UNEP are used primarily for providing support to the contributing multilateral environmental agreement secretariat. The finalization of the upcoming review initiated by UNEP management of the programme support cost management procedure provides an opportunity to ensure a transparent and clear approach in the allocation of funds fr",

The finalization of the upcoming review initiated by UNEP management of the programme support cost management procedure provides an opportunity to ensure a transparent and clear approach in the allocation of funds from this source. B. Resource mobilization 69. Finite number of donors, competing requests, polarized attention. As only around 5 per cent of its funding is provided by the regular budget, the resource mobilization function plays a key role for UNEP. As highlighted in several instances during the preparation of the review, the organization is considered well-placed for attracting resources. However, it was also pointed out that the strategic objective of addressing climate change tended to attract most of the funding. This is confirmed by the Planetary Funds distribution (43 per cent went to climate change in 2023\u20132024) and by the fact that the climate action subprogramme was the largest one in 2022\u2013 2023 among the seven included in the medium-term strategy for 2022\u20132025,56 looking at all financial dimensions: budget ($223 million); income ($616 million); and expenditure ($388 million).57 In the current global context, the Inspector wishes to __________________ 55 UNEP, minutes of the Budget Steering Committee meeting of 31 March 2023 (internal document). 56 The seven subprogrammes of the medium-term strategy for 2022\u20132025 are: climate action, nature action, and chemicals and pollution action (thematic subprogrammes); environmental policy, and science-policy (foundational subprogrammes); and digital transformations, and finance and economic transformations (enabling subprogrammes). 57 Presentation at the eleventh meeting of the Annual Subcommittee (2024) on agenda item 3 (b), Management and administration of UNEP, p. 4. JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 36 25-10420 underline that the topic of environment, and climate change in particular, is addressed by several organizations, funding mechanisms and institutions, all aiming to mobilize resources for their initiatives, while the pool of potential donors remains the same for all. In fact, the reliance on a limited number of contributors and funding sources has been highlighted in various parts of the present report.58 The Inspector notes that since the ninth meeting of the Annual Subcommittee, held in 2022, a standing agenda item has been introduced in these meetings in order to foster a more structured dialogue between the UNEP secretariat and the Committee of Permanent Representatives, enabling discussions on opportunities to widen the funding base of the organization. This is a positive development and the practice is encouraged. 70. Time to revise the resource mobilization strategy. The latest approved version of a corporate resource mobilization strategy dates back to 2021 and covers the medium-term strategy period, from 2022 to 2025. While the modus operandi of the organization has evolved with the approval and implementation of the 2022 delivery model, the Inspector observes that this has not yet triggered a revision of the strategy to tailor it to the current operational context, nor an explanatory note or guidance on how to operationalize changes brought forward by the new model, a situation which requires the foremost attention of UNEP management. A revised resource mobilization strategy can also serve as an opportunity to clarify the approach to philanthropy and private sector engagement, topics which seem to have regained attention within the organization in 2024 (see para. 86 below). 59 During the research conducted for the present review, the Inspector was made aware of cases of donors being approached by various teams within UNEP, with limited coordination between the requests put forward. A revised strategy should clarify roles and responsibilities to promote a more coherent and consistent approach to current and potential funding partners. In addition, to support resource mobilization efforts, the Inspector proposes the creation of an organization-wide client relations management system that would enable the organization to consolidate knowledge on funding partners, record resource mobilization initiatives, and track lessons learned and other relevant information in a single repository.",

In addition, to support resource mobilization efforts, the Inspector proposes the creation of an organization-wide client relations management system that would enable the organization to consolidate knowledge on funding partners, record resource mobilization initiatives, and track lessons learned and other relevant information in a single repository. Equally important is making sure that UNEP personnel continue to refine and strengthen their resource mobilization skills through specialized courses that could be part of the corporate training offer. 71. Resource mobilization in the secretariats of UNEP-administered multilateral environmental agreements. The secretariats of the multilateral environmental agreements have often developed their own resource mobilization strategies and approaches. While the mandates are distinct, topics covered by UNEP and these secretariats may intersect, with individual operations tackling different but synergistic sides of the issues. In this setting, the Inspector sees opportunities for more coordination on resource mobilization between UNEP and the secretariats to ensure clarity for donors and to build trust and sustainable partnerships. 72. The implementation of the following recommendation is expected to strengthen the coherence of resource mobilization across the organization. __________________ 58 As previously explained in this chapter, 75 per cent of Environment Fund contributions in 2024 originated from 10 countries, 38 per cent of the total UNEP income for 2022\u20132023 was provided by GEF, and one country accounted for 55 per cent of the income of the Planetary Funds for 2023\u20132024. 59 UNEP, For People and Planet: The United Nations Environment Programme Strategy for Tackling Climate Change, Biodiversity and Nature Loss, and Pollution and Waste from 2022\u2013 2025 (Nairobi, 2022), para. 118. JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 25-10420 37 Recommendation 5 The Executive Director should review and update, as appropriate, the current resource mobilization strategy and present it to the Committee of Permanent Representatives in 2026. C. Financial management 73. Financial management. UNEP adheres to the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations as supplemented by the Financial Rules of the Environment Fund and Associated Trust Funds of the United Nations Environment Programme, 60 and applies the International Public Sector Accounting Standards. Umoja is the standard financial management tool used across the organization while the financial management function is split between the units having administrative and/or financial management responsibilities within divisions and offices, and the Corporate Services Division. The Inspector found that UNEP consistently demonstrated sound financial management from 2020 to 2023 and abided by the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations. However, while the UNEP secretariat was found compliant, the Board of Auditors did highlight in annual reports recurrent operational inefficiencies, such as delays in project implementation and disbursement and issues in grant management and documentation. Nonetheless, these findings were not considered breaches, but rather areas for improvement in administrative and project oversight processes. 74. Trust funds management. UNEP has established and manages several trust funds, structured either as single-donor or multiple-donor, including those pertaining to the secretariats of the UNEP-administered multilateral environmental agreements. As explained in the report presented by the Executive Director at the sixth session of the Environment Assembly, UNEP administered 135 active trust funds at the end of 2023, down from 168 previously.61 The closure of inactive trust funds was a result of Environment Assembly decision 3/3, adopted in 2017. Nonetheless, during the sixth Assembly session, Member States agreed on the extension of the validity date for several trust funds up to 31 December 2030, while noting that going forward, the extension of the validity of a trust fund is an administrative matter entrusted to the Executive Director.62 V. Strategic planning, partnerships and risk management A. Strategic planning 75. Strategic planning framework. A planning cycle in UNEP spans four years and encompasses: (a) a medium-term strategy, which is the main strategic planning document of the organization; (b) two biennial programme of work and budget documents, which are meant to operationalize the strategic objectives of UNEP; and (c) four annual programme budgets (section 14), setting regular budget resources assigned by the General Assembly.",

A planning cycle in UNEP spans four years and encompasses: (a) a medium-term strategy, which is the main strategic planning document of the organization; (b) two biennial programme of work and budget documents, which are meant to operationalize the strategic objectives of UNEP; and (c) four annual programme budgets (section 14), setting regular budget resources assigned by the General Assembly. The first two of these documents are reviewed and adopted by the Environment Assembly, while the Committee of Permanent Representatives is tasked with monitoring their implementation. The third document is reviewed and adopted by the General Assembly. The present review found different approaches in the way in which UNEP management presents information on the subprogrammes, with deliverables being __________________ 60 ST/SGB/2013/4 and ST/SGB/2015/4. 61 UNEP/EA.6/INF/16, para. 4. 62 Environment Assembly decision 6/6.

The Inspector recommends improving future planning documents in this regard to ensure more coherence and traceability among them. 76. Increased complexity for operationalizing the medium-term strategy. The strategy for 2022\u20132025 identified as a general objective addressing the three planetary environmental crises: climate change; biodiversity and nature loss; and pollution. In this regard, in 2021, seven subprogrammes, each led by a Global Subprogramme Coordinator, were included in the medium-term strategy. The introduction of the delivery model in late 2022 was accompanied by an initiative referred to as the \u201cprogrammatic approach\u201d, which features 13 programme coordination projects (recently relabelled \u201cthematic programmes\u201d), each led by a Directly Responsible Individual reporting to a Global Subprogramme Coordinator. Since March 2024, UNEP management has been reporting to the Committee of Permanent Representatives on the objectives, results achieved, lessons learned and the way forward of each thematic programme through presentations in its subcommittee meetings. The Inspector observed that all programme coordination projects include projects and concepts that go beyond the current strategic planning period, some up to 2029, as shown in figure VI, and draws attention to the need to verify their integration into the objectives of the next medium-term strategy, which is to be adopted by the Environment Assembly at its seventh session. Figure VI Overview of programmatic architecture development timeline Source: Prepared by JIU (2025). 77. Several programmatic layers, some with an unclear implementation framework. In addition, the Inspector would like to highlight the following points emerging from the analysis: (a) All the programme coordination projects have primary and/or secondary links to one or several subprogrammes. This brings an additional layer of complexity for the subprogrammes to which only one programme coordination project is primarily linked (see foundational and enabling subprogrammes), as shown in figure VII; in these cases, there is an increased risk of duplication of responsibilities between the Directly Responsible Individual and the Global Subprogramme Coordinator, as also highlighted by the formative evaluation of the 2022 delivery model; JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 25-10420 39 Figure VII Overview of subprogrammes and the programmatic approach in the United Nations Environment Programme Source: Prepared by JIU (2025). (b) The midterm evaluations of 10 out of 13 programme coordination projects are due in 2025, while no evaluation plan is envisaged for the remaining three. These evaluations are neither clearly planned nor accounted for in the work programme of the Evaluation Office for the biennium 2024\u20132025, as available on the weCollaborate page. The Inspector takes note of the intention of UNEP management to integrate these midterm evaluations into the scope of the six-year plan of subprogramme evaluations, but this would come at a late stage for the 2026\u20132029 medium-term strategy and potentially even for the one starting in 2030. In addition, the proposed indicator frameworks of the programme coordination projects were not always found to be clear (i.e. missing definitions, metadata, baselines, etc.). Finally, information on the implementation of programme coordination projects is not currently included in the UNEP annual programme performance reports, a matter which should be rectified for the next reporting cycles. 78.

Finally, information on the implementation of programme coordination projects is not currently included in the UNEP annual programme performance reports, a matter which should be rectified for the next reporting cycles. 78. Strategic planning at the secretariats of multilateral environmental agreements. While the current JIU review does not focus on environmental governance, the Inspector acknowledges the complex strategic framework in which UNEP operates alongside the secretariats of multilateral environmental agreements, which have their own strategic planning processes as decided upon by their respective governing bodies. Measures were undertaken by UNEP management in recent years to enhance coordination through the increased participation of representatives of the secretariats of the multilateral environmental agreements in the UNEP strategic planning process, which is a welcome development. Indeed, the inputs of respondents from these secretariats showed that coherence and understanding of these processes are topics which merit further attention. JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 40 25-10420 The Inspector also emphasizes that it should be applied in both ways, so that UNEP is better informed of strategic planning advancements concerning the themes specifically relevant to the various multilateral environmental agreements. 79. Need to clarify and expand indicators included in the biennial programme of work and budget. The programme of work and budget includes a performance framework composed of quantitative and qualitative indicators. The determination of indicators and their associated targets and baselines is coordinated by the Strategic Planning Unit, while the monitoring and reporting on target attainment is coordinated by the Performance Monitoring and Reporting Unit. Despite both units being situated within the Policy and Programme Division, the Inspector observes that the definition and calculation of targets and baselines of indicators and their monitoring could have been more coherent and better coordinated for the programme of work and budget documents covering the 2022\u20132025 period. The Inspector has reviewed the 53 indicators included in these documents and would like to emphasize certain weaknesses, such as the lack of an established methodology for calculating baselines, the lack of definition of indicators and the use of highly aggregated indicators with multiple units of measurement. In addition, only half of the UNEP staff responding to the JIU survey considered that the current indicators were relevant for showcasing progress towards the three strategic objectives of the organization. The Inspector notes the intention of UNEP management to implement detailed measurement protocols that will be built, engaged on and inserted into the information technology systems used to track the indicators. The Inspector recommends strengthening the UNEP performance framework by: (a) producing indicator methodologies that explain their definition and how the baseline and targets are calculated, as such elements were found to be missing in the review of the programme of work and budget documents; and (b) reflecting on the nature of these indicators to ensure that they reflect the most relevant outcomes of UNEP activities, as currently some indicators measure multiple dimensions. Finally, the Inspector notes that although impact indicators were selected for the medium-term strategy for 2018\u20132021, this practice has not been continued since. This means that future evaluations aiming to assess the impact of subprogrammes and the work of UNEP will start off with a significant data gap in terms of results achieved on a medium-term basis, beyond the immediate outputs and outcomes of projects. This was acknowledged as a challenge in one of the senior management team meetings in late 2023. The Inspector recommends including impact indicators in medium-term strategies and planning for relevant data collection beyond project completion dates. 80. Mainstreaming results-based management. There are numerous initiatives dedicated to mainstreaming results-based management throughout the organization and the secretariats of the multilateral environmental agreements, as relevant. These are: (a) the availability of a dedicated online training course; (b) the introduction of results- based management quality standards, by means of a mandatory UNEP-specific project management certification effective March 2024; (c) the monthly convening of a community of practice on project management to",

The Inspector also notes the work on updating the Programme and Project Management Manual (2023 edition), which is the de facto repository of relevant policies and procedures and includes guidance, templates and tools to advance the mainstreaming of results-based management across the organization. Despite the above-mentioned actions, only two thirds of UNEP staff responding to the JIU survey have a basic understanding of how results-based management is implemented in the organization, as shown in table 9. The Inspector considers that further capacity-building actions on this topic could not only ensure the appropriate knowledge among staff, but also support them in their career development.

Portfolio analysis. At the end of 2024, UNEP had around 600 projects under implementation, with the vast majority funded through earmarked funds. 63 As mentioned, the funding model that is strongly reliant on tightly earmarked contributions may be perceived as driving the organization towards expanding its project base, while constraining the ability of UNEP management to refine strategic priorities and remove obsolete ones. This became evident from the review of the documentation of the programme coordination projects and the formative evaluation of the delivery model, which showed that, as is also the case for other organizations, several projects are phased or are a continuation of existing ones. Often the time needed between concept development and project operational closure goes beyond the horizon of the strategic planning cycle in which the project was conceived. This is due to the time required for donor approval of the concept, the UNEP implementation processes, and the subsequent project delivery and closure. These limitations support the suggested analysis referenced in paragraph 66 above. 82. Plethora of reporting mechanisms. The documentary analysis revealed several mechanisms and documents produced by the UNEP secretariat to report on the various dimensions of the work of the organization.64 These are summarized in figure VIII. Such reporting generates a high workload for various teams within the organization, while in its response to the corporate questionnaire, UNEP management stated that monitoring and reporting activities were substantially underequipped in terms of both human and financial resources. In this context, the Inspector makes the following remarks: (a) For several monthly internal reports, manual input of data is still required, such as for human resources-related data (interns, certain data relating to consultants) and for information on the few projects currently not present in the Umoja Integrated Planning, Monitoring and Reporting Solution (IPMR). The Inspector takes note of the transition period up to the end of 2025 for entering data related to projects implemented by the multilateral environmental agreement secretariats into IPMR. __________________ 63 Quarterly business review corporate report (December 2024, internal document).",

JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 42 25-10420 The Inspector is aware that, in many cases, further automatization of data is contingent on factors beyond the direct control of UNEP and depends on Secretariat- level solutions; (b) Reporting on indicators included in the programme of work and budget is not complete. When reviewing the Programme Performance Report 2022\u20132023, the Inspector noticed that explicit reporting on qualitative indicators was missing. While such information could be inferred from the narrative, the Inspector encourages UNEP management to structure more clearly its reporting on qualitative indicators, which could contribute to the demonstration of results attained by the organization; (c) Project indicators are systematized in a centralized corporate system (IPMR), which enables the aggregation of results against the targets set out in the programme of work and budget. As explained by UNEP management in its response to the JIU corporate questionnaire, the remaining areas for improvement include the continued socialization of the system and its enhanced features, and the effective utilization of performance reports. In this context, timely reporting by project teams and rigorous data validation by project managers and their supervisors are important factors to be considered. Figure VIII Overview of reporting mechanisms Source: Prepared by JIU (2025). JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 25-10420 43 B. Partnerships 83. New partnership policy. UNEP adheres to the definition adopted by the General Assembly, by which partnerships are \u201cvoluntary and collaborative relationships between various parties, both public and non-public, in which all participants agree to work together to achieve a common purpose or undertake a specific task and, as mutually agreed, to share risks and responsibilities, resources and benefits\u201d. 65 In June 2024, following extensive preparatory work over several years, a new partnership policy was approved by the senior management team with the aim of improving the partnership framework of the organization. 66 The issuance of the policy is also in follow-up to concerns expressed by the Board of Auditors and OIOS.67 The policy frames the principles for engaging in and managing partnerships. It identifies and consolidates four types of partners (governmental, intergovernmental, non-governmental and United Nations system organizations) and four partnership modalities (multi-stakeholder, cooperation, implementation and donor partnerships). As at the end of 2024, UNEP was engaged in almost 1,300 partnerships, mostly for project implementation, with 3,600 registered partners (see table 10). A good practice noted by the Inspector is that a dedicated page on the weCollaborate platform highlights key differences between the policy endorsed in 2024 and its previous iteration, of 2011. Due to significant differences compared with the previous version of the policy, UNEP management adopted a cautious approach by implementing a one-year transition period ending in June 2025. This was meant to facilitate the implementation of the new processes and to conduct a lessons-learned exercise.68 The Inspector notes that the policy includes provisions on the secretariats of the multilateral environmental agreements which often have their own arrangements for concluding partnership agreements.

Due diligence process and termination of partnerships. Among the key principles supporting its partnerships, UNEP management stated the strengthening of the due diligence process in the context of a risk-based approach, notably towards non-performing partners. Nonetheless, adequate capacity must be planned to achieve this. At this point, the new process introduced as a result of the 2024 policy may be considered too stringent by the internal stakeholders and has raised some concerns in __________________ 65 General Assembly resolution 73/254, para. 4. 66 UNEP Partnership Policy (2024, internal document). 67 OIOS Internal Audit Division, report No. 2020/021, entitled \u201cAudit of management of partnerships at the United Nations Environment Programme\u201d (2020); and A/75/5/Add.7, chap. II. 68 Memorandum of the Executive Director dated 29 June 2024 (internal document). JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 44 25-10420 terms of its applicability to certain categories of partners. This difficulty is reflected in an OIOS audit of the climate action subprogramme which recorded missing due diligence documentation for its sample of implementing partners. 69 The Inspector observes that it is not standard UNEP practice to terminate an unsatisfactory partnership, and that UNEP generally allows such relations to run until expiration without renewal. This may change in the future given the enhanced expectation on due diligence. The Inspector suggests centrally recording information on any terminated partnerships to reinforce the due diligence approach. 85. Challenges linked to partnership portals. At the time of the present review, the management of partnerships involved the use of three different online platforms: two managed by the United Nations Secretariat (the UN Partner Portal, and a dedicated module in Umoja) and one by UNEP (the UNEP Partner Portal). As indicated by internal stakeholders, this setup hindered the ability of UNEP to create a global repository of partners, a challenge that needs to be addressed during the transition period, especially if a more decentralized approach to partnerships may emerge in the medium term, with the establishment of regional partnerships committees. Currently, a Partnership Committee is operational, which supports the approval process for moderate- to high-risk partnerships. Adequate systems (i.e. a new UNEP partnership portal) and corresponding training are important for the implementation of the new policy, especially as it comes with an extensive set of templates, tools and procedures. 86. Private sector and philanthropy. Research conducted by JIU indicated the existence of several policies and strategies on this topic that are at various stages of finalization and/or implementation. UNEP adopted its first policy on engaging with the private sector in 2017 and has had a strategy for private sector engagement since October 2019. In addition, a draft version of the playbook on the private sector engagement process, dated June 2024, has been shared with the Inspector. The 2024 policy on partnerships supersedes all prior reference documents related to partnerships; however, UNEP management communicated that the 2019 strategy remains the guiding document for its Private Sector Unit. While the due diligence process for partnerships and resource mobilization from the philanthropy sector was retained as a responsibility by the partnership team within the Corporate Services Division, the Private Sector Unit was moved from the latter to the Industry and Economy Division in November 2024. The Inspector was made aware that a five-year framework strategy on philanthropic engagement had been developed between August 2024 and February 2025 and was pending approval at the time of finalizing the present review. As the new policy on partnerships supersedes several previous policies, the Inspector suggests clarifying in the announced revision of the philanthropic engagement strategy how the engagement of the organization with the private sector and its recent attention to philanthropy are articulated in the broader framework, especially as divergent views on the topics were expressed by several UNEP officials. Some highlighted the potential benefits of harnessing private sector capacity to drive transformative changes in the global economy and promote sustainability.",

Some highlighted the potential benefits of harnessing private sector capacity to drive transformative changes in the global economy and promote sustainability. Others, however, cautioned against this approach, emphasizing potential risks, including reputational concerns. The Inspector looks forward to the announced revision of the philanthropic engagement strategy in the course of 2025, as indicated by UNEP management. 87. Inter-agency collaboration. UNEP management has reported three approaches for leveraging the technical and operational expertise of the organization: (a) mainstreaming the environment into the programmes and policies of other United __________________ 69 OIOS Internal Audit Division, report No. 2025/002, entitled \u201cAudit of the climate action subprogramme at the United Nations Environment Programme\u201d. JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 25-10420 45 Nations entities; (b) delivering at the country level; and (c) coordinating environment- related issues within the United Nations system. The Executive Director chairs the United Nations Environment Management Group, a coordination body established in 2001 which is tasked with identifying and coordinating approaches to international environmental matters among its 52 members, including the secretariats of the global multilateral environmental agreements.70 The Environment Management Group is one of the three main inter-agency mechanisms relevant in this area along with the United Nations Sustainable Development Group, which ensures coordination in the implementation of development operations at the country level, and the High-level Committee on Programmes, which oversees policy coherence and programme coordination. While coordination and policy coherence are common objectives, the Group is specifically tasked with identifying solutions on environmental matters demanding coordinated approaches. This is intended to be achieved through a two- tiered structure: a senior-level decision-making body, consisting of senior-level officials, and a series of time-bound issue-based workstreams. Recent examples of this work include the progress of system-wide common approaches on biodiversity and pollution aiming at cohesive, systematic and collaborative efforts across the United Nations system. The inputs collected for the review suggest that the functions of the Group are focused on data consolidation and the identification of complementary areas of intervention between United Nations system entities. Contrary to its predecessor, the Environment Coordination Board, which was placed under the Administrative Committee on Coordination, the Environment Management Group is not integrated within the CEB machinery. 71 The terms of reference are currently under review, and the Inspector suggests examining whether adding a reporting line to the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination would benefit and facilitate the work of the Group. As Chair of the Group, the Executive Director has a key role to play in that regard. 88. Joint programmes and partnerships with other United Nations entities could be further strengthened. UNEP management conducted an analysis of its partnerships with United Nations system entities. In January 2022, as recorded in its portal, only 5 per cent of its partnership agreements were with United Nations entities and, among those agreements, two thirds were with four entities.72 Joint programmes or joint projects represented an even smaller percentage of engagement, but this information is not currently centralized. The Inspector was made aware of efforts initiated by UNEP management in 2025 towards clarifying the in-house definitions and monitoring arrangements of such joint initiatives, and looks forward to the conclusion of this process. While the 2024 partnership policy can be seen as a response to some of these observations, the Inspector encourages UNEP management to continue its reflection on a less fragmented and more strategic approach to partnering with United Nations entities. There are opportunities in this area, as a review conducted by the Policy and Programme Division several years ago concluded that the thematic area of environment was integrated in about 90 per cent of the common country assessments or United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Frameworks analysed, in most cases as climate-related",

In this regard, the Inspector notes that the Development Coordination Unit within the Policy and Programme Division has included in its workplan for 2024\u20132025 priorities __________________ 70 See General Assembly resolution 53/242; and the terms of reference of the Environment Management Group (document not dated). 71 The representatives of the United Nations organizations participating in the Group also represent their entities in CEB. 72 The United Nations Institute for Training and Research, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the World Meteorological Organization and UNOPS (based on data from the Partners Portal, September 2021). JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 46 25-10420 regarding strengthened engagement with the resident coordinator system and the United Nations country teams. 89. Pilot at the United Nations country team level. As the organization has limited country presence and is often a non-resident agency even for projects conducted on- site, it generally relies on a network of remote focal points to ensure engagement with United Nations country teams. The Inspector is aware that UNEP management is exploring ways to scale up its visibility and demonstrate its potential for impact at the national level, and welcomes this initiative. The current vision is to have focal points posted in the field for facilitating the coherence of activities by engaging with the resident coordinator offices and country teams in order to increase awareness and ensure that environmental issues are properly included in the common country assessments and the subsequent programming of activities. Nonetheless, the Inspector notes that there is no mention of the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework in the 2022 Policy for One UNEP Delivery for Better Collaboration and Country Support. An initial list of 19 priority countries had been established for the deployment of these focal points; however, financial constraints in 2024 have reduced the scale of the initiative to six posts, and the initiative is currently on hold due to budget constraints imposed in the context of the UN80 Initiative. C. Risk management 90. The enterprise risk management framework requires strengthening. In September 2021, the senior management team endorsed the enterprise risk management implementation strategies and guidelines on the basis of the United Nations Secretariat framework designed in 2011. 73 In addition, the main reference documents are Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Control (2021, a guide for the implementation of a UNEP-wide framework) and the Programme and Project Management Manual (2023). These constitute the core foundation of the risk management framework in the organization. The Inspector takes note that the 2021 enterprise risk management guidelines were under review at the time of the preparation of the present report. However, the current framework is still not yet fully mature, and UNEP management acknowledges the need for improvements to align the organization to the benchmarks proposed by JIU in 2020. 74 Currently, UNEP has a risk register, the most recent version of which was uploaded to Umoja in 2023, and an internal risk dashboard, which is being updated for further alignment with the organization\u2019s current operational and programmatic context. The Inspector draws attention to the fact that less than half of the staff respondents to the JIU survey consider that UNEP identifies relevant risks to the mandate and puts in place sufficient mitigation measures, and even less so (only one third of respondents) among multilateral environmental agreement secretariat staff specifically. Noting that UNEP, in alignment with the United Nations Secretariat, has not at this stage developed a risk appetite statement, the Inspector considers that such an instrument would be useful, as further detailed in the CEB guidelines on risk appetite statements. 75 While an Enterprise Risk Management Committee exists, it has convened only once since its creation in 2021.",

As the composition and the expected functions of this Committee were not matching, discussions are currently under way for reframing its terms of reference, and addressing this gap is a pressing requirement. At the project level, risk management is considered more mature. The Inspector was informed that each project is assigned by the Project Review Committee a risk rating that determines the depth of its follow-up oversight actions. The partnership policy issued in 2024 has been __________________ 73 See A/66/692, annex. 74 See JIU/REP/2020/5. 75 CEB/2019/HLCM/26. JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 25-10420 47 reinforced in terms of the due diligence process regarding partners engaging with UNEP for project implementation. 91. Capacity for risk management. The risk management function is hosted in the Operations and Risk Management Unit, which was created in 2022 within the Corporate Services Division. The Unit has a diversified portfolio of responsibilities beyond enterprise risk management and its associated functions, including the coordination of audit operations in the organization, organizational resilience, asset, facilities and travel management, the environment management system and archives management. The team focusing on risk management comprises an enterprise risk management officer at the P-3 level, funded through the Environment Fund, with a part-time focus on these specific tasks and, since the first quarter of 2025, an officer in a supporting function at the P-2 level, whose primarily role is audit coordination. A network of risk focal points in divisions and regional offices was established in the last quarter of 2022. However, they are mostly junior and/or assistant level staff members who are perceived to lack the capacity to substantively engage further on this topic with senior line managers in their respective divisions and offices. The Inspector also notes the establishment of focal points for risk management within the secretariats of the UNEP-administered multilateral environmental agreements as of October 2024, which is a positive development for bringing the respective organizational frameworks closer to each other. 92. Risk management culture. An internal online training module on enterprise risk management was launched in 2022, and a training course on integrated environment management systems and enterprise risk management has been offered since 2023, the latter gathering 54 registrations in its first two years but only nine course completions. Risk management is not a traditional agenda item of Committee of Permanent Representatives meetings or Environment Assembly sessions. On the basis of interviews, however, there is a certain level of interest in this topic from Member States. Nonetheless, the relevant concepts need to be better explained, and the benefits of having an appropriate risk management framework should be explicitly outlined. In addition, regular updates on the risks faced by the organization and the corresponding mitigation measures undertaken by UNEP management should be provided. 93. Chief Risk Officer. The Inspector acknowledges the initial efforts towards developing a more robust enterprise risk management framework and recommends further actions aimed at strengthening the risk management culture across the organization. One potential initiative would be elevating the accountability and reporting lines of the head of the Operations and Risk Management Unit, which currently are to the Deputy Director of the Corporate Services Division. In addition, within existing resources, the designation of a Chief Risk Officer with sufficient authority to contribute to strengthening the risk management culture across the organization is required and is observed to be a best practice today by the United Nations funds and programmes. In the absence of a Chief Risk Officer, the Inspector stresses the importance of: (a) establishing, as a priority, a functional Enterprise Risk Management Committee, with corresponding terms of reference endorsed by the senior management team, that can steer the risk management function and activities across the organization; and (b) nominating risk focal points with an adequate level of seniority to allow for subsequent engagement within UNEP management, as appropriate. 94.",

VI. Human resources A. Human resources management 95. Human resources strategy and reporting. The Inspector notes that UNEP management has not developed an entity-specific human resource management strategy that would factor in its own operational requirements. Instead, the People Strategy 2021\u20132025 of the United Nations Secretariat is the main reference document and provides the overarching framework for the management of human resources. UNEP management communicated that specific workstreams had been developed and implemented for adapting the Strategy to the organization\u2019s context and requirements.76 However, the absence of a human resources strategy was included as a risk for the organization in its 2023 risk register. Indeed, a UNEP-specific human resources strategy could be useful, for example, to operationalize the shift in responsibilities of certain organizational entities following the implementation of the 2022 delivery model. Concerning reporting mechanisms on human resources matters, UNEP management has access to a comprehensive set of human resources statistics, including monthly dashboards containing comprehensive and real-time information on the UNEP workforce, including data on affiliate personnel. Part of those data are aggregated and further presented in the meetings that the senior management team dedicates to the quarterly business review process. Furthermore, updated figures disaggregated by staff grade, gender and geographical representation are included in the quarterly reports presented to the Committee of Permanent Representatives (and its Annual Subcommittee), as well as in the annual programme performance reports of UNEP. 96. Effectiveness of human resources management processes negatively assessed. As evident from the responses to the JIU survey presented in table 8, the area of human resources, which involves several internal stakeholders, is perceived by UNEP staff as being among the least efficient administrative process in the organization, especially when considering the practical implementation of existing procedures. Practical examples provided in this regard by various categories of stakeholders include: (a) the transformation of clearance processes, into approval ones for the recruitment of Professional staff (at the P-4 level and below), thereby disrupting the proper implementation of the delegation of authority framework; (b) insufficient communication between the Corporate Services Division and human resources focal points from other divisions and regional offices during initial stages of recruitment processes, leading to cases of rescindment of recruitment decisions at the final stages; (c) in certain cases, geographical considerations being perceived to take precedence over technical competency and the skills of candidates; and (d) prolonged delays in recruitment processes and other human resources __________________ 76 The Inspector notes the consultation with the United Nations Secretariat and other United Nations entities to develop an \u201cenvironmental\u201d job family with five specialty areas, and expects this work to be swiftly finalized.

Opportunities for enhancement. In terms of continuous learning and workforce development, UNEP management refers to the United Nations Secretariat Learning Strategy, covering the period 2021\u20132025. The organization is subject to the United Nations mandatory training programmes, for which it recorded more than 95 per cent compliance among staff members in 2024. A few additional training modules are considered mandatory for specialized functions. Regarding affiliate personnel, while there is no mandatory training, approximately half of respondents to the JIU survey attended training programmes in the past two years, but less so in the case of home-based individuals. The UNEP \u201cLearning needs analysis report 2024/25\u201d, consulted by the Inspector, provided only general figures and an unsubstantiated estimate cost of $110,000,78 and did not clearly differentiate organizational learning needs, existing learning channels and the current educational offerings. In the absence of a tailor-made learning strategy, more efforts are needed for planning and ensuring learning development and the upskilling of UNEP personnel, starting with more clarity in UNEP learning needs analysis. This is confirmed by the JIU survey to UNEP staff, which revealed that only half of the respondents considered that the available training opportunities were supporting their upskilling. Moreover, the opportunities for career development through internal mobility scored poorly among respondents, with only 27 per cent expressing satisfaction in this regard. Staff at the Nairobi headquarters, field offices and multilateral environmental agreement secretariats responded in a similar manner to these questions. Recalling also the low rate of positive responses from the last UNEP pulse survey in 2022 on these topics, the Inspector deems them important for further monitoring in future surveys.79 98. Corporate Academy. The Corporate Academy initiative is an online training platform designed by the UNEP secretariat. The substantive content has been gradually produced collaboratively within the organization and, in 2024, 11 modules were available to participants. UNEP management indicated that the learning management system costs 24,900 euros (approximately $29,000) per year. Since its launch in 2019, the Corporate Academy has seen 1,950 participants enrolling and 673 participants completing one of the modules, with the finance courses being the most attended ones. The completion of courses in the Academy, currently at a rate of 35 per cent, could be better encouraged across the organization to ensure the best cost-benefit ratio. In addition, as highlighted in the current training needs analysis, the Academy learning offer focuses on administrative and corporate services, while the needs of the organization are also for technical and substantive topics, such as scientific writing and resource mobilization.80 99.

The latest presentation of results was made in a senior management team meeting in April 2023. 80 The project management certification course is not part of the Corporate Academy.

It is positive to note that more than two thirds of those sharing their views were satisfied with the level of support provided by their supervisors and were comfortable discussing personal human resources matters with them. The performance appraisal process is generally considered timely, transparent and objective. The majority of respondents consider their work as being clearly linked to the objectives of their unit/office, as it was also the case in the latest UNEP pulse survey, in 2022. However, there is a perception that the division of tasks between team members could be better addressed and, moreover, when asked about the functioning of their units/offices as a whole, respondents perceived current human and financial capacities as not sufficiently adequate. The present review identified another specific area for attention: the satisfaction with work-life balance has slightly declined compared with the latest UNEP pulse survey. The Inspector draws attention to the approach to flexible working arrangements, according to which UNEP management currently requires a minimum four-day presence in the office, irrespective of duty station, in line with the guidance issued in June 2023 by the Director of the Corporate Services Division, while the flexible working arrangements of the United Nations Secretariat indicate that \u201ca manager may allow a staff member to telecommute within the duty station up to a maximum of three days during the work week\u201d. 81 This approach raised concerns across survey respondents and interviewees, and creates tensions across the organization. According to UNEP management, the benefits in terms of team integration and coordination with Member States supersede those concerns.

Staff-management dynamics. The United Nations Nairobi Staff Union and Outposted Offices is the entity representing UNEP personnel in the interactions with management. The Inspector notes the dissatisfaction expressed by the majority of respondents regarding several aspects of staff-management relations and staff representation (see table 12). This perception is prominent in particular among international staff and within secretariats of the multilateral environmental agreements. It is also interesting to observe that inputs from field offices are slightly __________________ 81 ST/SGB/2019/3, para 3.7. JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 25-10420 51 more positive compared to headquarters. In the context of an organization present in multiple regions and different cultural contexts, staff-management dynamics may vary depending on the local leadership and specifics of each office. UNEP management communicated that a series of efforts had been undertaken to increase communication with personnel, for example, through monthly town hall meetings, monthly letters of the Executive Director, pulse surveys and the weCollaborate platform. However, these channels were mostly perceived by interviewees and survey respondents as one-way communication and lacking sufficient follow-up measures on issues raised. The Inspector encourages the organization to continue to cultivate a more responsive and participatory environment, enhancing staff morale and productivity.

B. Workforce of the United Nations Environment Programme 101. The UNEP workforce is expanding. Table 13 provides a comparison of the workforce for the years 2020 and 2024. In 2024, a total of 2,833 individuals were employed by UNEP, which corresponds to an increase of 38 per cent in five years. While the number of staff members has increased at a modest pace, there is notable growth in the number of affiliate personnel recruited under various non-staff contractual modalities, the evolution of which can be related to the upward trend of earmarked contributions and the expansion of the portfolio of projects. In the staff category, the Inspector notes that the number of staff employed in the secretariats of multilateral environmental agreements remained practically unchanged over the years (representing 296 individuals in 2024). Table 13 Overview of the United Nations Environment Programme workforce, 2020 and 2024 2020 2024 Percentage increase Staff members 1 268 1 383 +9 Affiliate workforce 784 1 450 +85 UNEP personnel 2 052 2 833 +38 Source: Prepared by JIU on the basis of information provided by UNEP (2025). 102. Only fixed-term appointment limited positions advertised as of February 2025. Since June 2024, UNEP management has used the contractual modality of JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 52 25-10420 fixed-term appointment limited (FTA-limited) for project-based positions funded by extrabudgetary contributions. While the policy has existed at the United Nations Secretariat level since 2013, this option was not favoured by the organization before 2024. 82 Following instructions from the Executive Director on prudent budget management in February 2025, the decision was taken to expand its application by advertising all future job openings of one year or more that were funded through voluntary contributions within UNEP and multilateral environmental agreement secretariats as FTA-limited positions. While acknowledging the financial uncertainties confronting many United Nations entities in 2025 and understanding the specificities of the UNEP portfolio, caution and strict oversight should be applied with this approach, considering that the selection process for FTA-limited does not include an external review by a central review body. 103. Geographical diversity. The United Nations overarching principles regarding diversity apply to UNEP and are complemented by the United Nations Environment Assembly resolution on the matter, adopted in 2022. 83 UNEP management has proactively promoted diversity among its staff, including through the flagship Young Talent Pipeline, whereby the organization welcomed young professionals at the P-2 level from underrepresented regions in January 2024 and February 2025. In 2024, 69 per cent of Member States were represented among the categories of staff members (see figure IX). Figure IX Overview of Member States represented among staff members, 2024 Source: Prepared by JIU on the basis of information provided by UNEP (2025). 104. Progress towards diversity. Figure X compares the diversity among staff members in the Professional and higher categories for the years 2020 and 2024 according to the regional grouping used by the United Nations Secretariat. The Inspector observes progress in this regard, acknowledging that rebalancing the respective proportions for each group to attain a more equitable distribution requires sustained efforts on a medium- to long-term horizon. As a consequence, the respective proportions have remained relatively stable over the past five years. In 2022, almost half of staff members in the Professional and higher categories originated from one regional group.",

Incentive measures questioned. In line with Secretary-General\u2019s bulletin ST/SGB/2019/2, UNEP executive management has closely overseen the implementation of incentive measures aimed at enhancing geographical diversity and gender balance, validating that recruitment and appointments across the organization respond to such considerations. During the preparation of the present review, recruiting line managers expressed some concern regarding a strict implementation of measures encouraging diversity, considering them as limiting their ability to employ the best-skilled workforce for specialized positions. They also considered that the oversight and clearance requirements during certain recruitment processes potentially impeded them from exercising their delegated authority. This perception is also prominent among managers within the secretariats of the multilateral environmental agreements, as their staffing figures are computed as being part of the UNEP secretariat but at the same time are subject to oversight from their own governing bodies. While maintaining the overarching objective of reaching a balanced level of geographical diversity, as stated notably in the Charter of the United Nations, a more flexible approach could be considered by UNEP management, under which an organizational entity (i.e. division and/or office and/or multilateral environmental agreement secretariat) deemed to already have a broad diversity profile would not be subject to the same stringent requirements during appointment processes as would one lacking such a profile. 106. Gender balance. UNEP management is guided by the overall initiatives launched by the Secretary-General on gender issues, such as the system-wide strategy on gender parity, and the United Nations System-wide Action Plan on gender equality and the Empowerment of Women and its accountability framework. In addition, UNEP management established a specific gender architecture structure under the authority and responsibility of the Executive Director, as outlined in her compact with the Secretary-General. In its response to the JIU questionnaire, UNEP management reported excellent results against these initiatives, which were acknowledged also by the respondents to the JIU survey. In December 2024, 62 per cent of staff were female. Figure XI illustrates the gender distribution in various categories of employees, highlighting a lower proportion of male representation, particularly at the executive management and director levels. The Inspector draws attention to the fact that gender balance should be continuously pursued as an objective, including from the perspective of the male staff component of the workforce. 19% 164 18% 145 22% 189 19% 154 5% 46 4% 28 11% 89 9% 73 42% 357 50% 395 2024 2022 African Group Asia-Pacific Group Eastern European Group Latin America and Caribbean Group Western European and Others Group JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 54 25-10420 Figure XI Overview of gender balance among staff members, 2024 (Percentage) Source: Prepared by JIU on the basis of information provided by UNEP (2025). 107.

Affiliate personnel represent an increasing part of the workforce. In 2024, UNEP affiliate personnel comprised about 1,500 individuals hired through various contractual modalities, as presented in table 14. The main contractual arrangements for engaging consultants and individual contractors in UNEP are through UNON or UNOPS, which have different corresponding rules and provisions. Based on the replies to the JIU survey, their most frequent fields of work are project management, followed by communication and administration. The share of affiliate personnel in the overall workforce has grown from 38 per cent in 2020 to 51 per cent in 2024. While UNEP is not an outlier in the United Nations system in this regard, this evolution must be closely monitored and its impact on the organization must be assessed, keeping in mind the advantages and risks associated with such an evolution. In 2023, the senior management team reflected on the appropriate balance between staff and non-staff personnel and requested an organization-wide consultation on the matter. UNEP management communicated that that aspect was included in the organizational functional review planned for 2025, and the Inspector is looking forward to its swift conclusion and subsequent decisions. Given the current structure of the workforce, the Inspector draws attention to the main findings and conclusions of the 2023 system-wide review of affiliate personnel contractual modalities in the United Nations system organizations. 84 In addition, the Inspector welcomes the initiative of the senior management team in 2025 to enhance the quarterly business review presentations with the number of individuals contracted through UNOPS, broken down by division and regional office, similar to what already exists for UNON __________________ 84 JIU/REP/2023/8. 100% 100% 80% 56% 50% 54% 59% 64% 42% 72% 75% 69% 68% 14% 20% 44% 50% 46% 41% 36% 58% 28% 25% 31% 32% 86% USG (1) ASG (3) D-2 (10) D-1 (52) P-5 (122) P-4 (290) P-3 (259) P-2 (109) NPO (12) G-7 (131) G-6 (223) G-5 (143) G-4 (28) G-3 (7) Female Male JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 25-10420 55 contracted consultants and individual contractors, and looks forward to its implementation.

Abbreviation: n/a, not applicable. 108. Issues related to affiliate personnel. In addition, the Inspector highlights the following observations for consideration by UNEP management: (a) The majority of respondents to the JIU survey to affiliate personnel confirmed the receipt of the relevant provisions governing their contracts and the usefulness of information presented therein, including in relation to the required code of conduct and ethical behaviour. However, the Inspector expresses concern over the fact that one third of respondents indicated having different tasks than those agreed in their terms of reference, and only half of them reported having either a formal or informal performance appraisal process in place; (b) While affiliate personnel are not governed by the same provisions on gender and diversity as staff members, UNEP management has stated that it remains attentive to these aspects. This approach is in line with General Assembly resolutions stressing that consultants should be attracted and drawn from the widest possible basis.85 At the end of 2024, 125 countries were represented among affiliate personnel. The Inspector observes that females were predominant in the categories of volunteers (66 per cent) and interns (76 per cent); (c) As mentioned earlier, comprehensive information on staffing beyond positions subject to provisions on geographical distribution is regularly shared with the members of the Committee of Permanent Representatives and the Environment Assembly, which is a good practice. However, this information refers only to staff members, covering in essence half of the workforce of the organization. As the affiliate workforce represented more than 50 per cent of UNEP personnel in 2024, and since the information exists already in internal monthly dashboards, the Inspector suggests also reporting the data on affiliate personnel to the Committee o",

Communications and outreach 109. Strategic communication in UNEP. Communications and outreach are key organizational functions for an entity mostly relying on voluntary contributions and are closely linked to the capacity to demonstrate the results of activities. At the highest level, UNEP follows the United Nations communications priorities defined annually by the Department of Global Communications of the Secretariat, for which \u201cmobilizing climate action\u201d was a key message used in 2024. For several years, UNEP has referred to the central theme of \u201cthe triple planetary crisis\u201d to structure its public communications; however, the specific terminology of \u201cthree planetary environmental crises\u201d is used in communications directed to Member States, as indicated in the UNEP messaging guide issued in January 2025. The Inspector welcomes this clarification, since UNEP, as the leading organization entrusted with delivering scientific and policy guidance on environmental matters, must use consistent terminology in its communications to accurately reflect its mandate and core focus. 110. JIU benchmarks on public information and communications. The Inspector concurs with the UNEP management self-assessment against the benchmarks on public information and communications issued by JIU in 2015, which was positive, with the organization meeting all benchmarks. 87 As acknowledged by UNEP management in the self-assessment, monitoring and oversight of the communication function can be improved, with a view to better quantifying the outcomes and impact of communication efforts and to strengthen the oversight on project-level communications. However, it would require significant resources to ensure a robust monitoring and evaluation of communication efforts and campaigns at outcome or impact levels, to which UNEP cannot currently commit. Therefore, often measurement of reach and impact is limited to downloads and media mentions. It was also acknowledged that the oversight and guidance on project-level communications remain limited. In this regard, the Inspector notes the requests by two UNEP management committees in 2024 for strengthening the tracking tools for the use of UNEP publication and communication products, and encourages UNEP management to further examine this issue.88 111. Communications Division. The Communications Division is tasked with raising the organization\u2019s profile and disseminating UNEP messages through media outlets, the Internet and audiovisual and printed products, along with an array of events, awards and partnerships. In 2024, UNEP had around 10 million followers on social media platforms, almost 12 million visitors on its website and close to 160,000 media citations. UNEP is also engaging with personalities and celebrities across the globe as part of its Goodwill Ambassadors programme for raising awareness on environmental actions and risks. The Inspector was informed that the United Nations Secretariat designation guidelines applicable to that programme were lacking clarity as regards the liabilities of the organization towards the individuals serving as ambassadors, and therefore the matter should be clarified. While the Division is not formally in charge of the public information and communications activities of the multilateral environmental agreement secretariats per se, it disseminates nonetheless their communications products through its systems and channels to amplify their outreach, particularly during meetings of the conferences of parties. The Communications Division is also responsible for internal communication. The main channel in this regard is the UNEP weCollaborate information-sharing platform, which overall is rich in content. However, the Inspector observed that the content of __________________ 87 JIU/REP/2015/4.",

Capacity of the communication function. The Communications Division has about 40 staff members and 10 affiliate personnel, most of them funded by core resources. In addition, UNEP communication relies on a network of regional communications officers reporting to the regional directors and/or communication units within the substantive divisions (usually comprising one Professional staff member supported by communication experts, volunteers and interns). The strategic importance of communication is acknowledged by the direct reporting line of the Director of the Division to the Executive Director. The review identified several coordination mechanisms among internal stakeholders, such as the broad dissemination of the document containing UNEP communications priorities and regular coordination meetings. In view of the multiple coordination layers for communication activities, including for the communication activities within individual projects, the Inspector suggests that the UNEP Evaluation Office conduct a comprehensive corporate evaluation of the communication function integrating an assessment of the efficiency, effectiveness and administrative distribution of responsibilities across UNEP organizational entities so as to ensure that the function best supports the implementation of the 2022 delivery model and the overall programmatic approach of UNEP. B. Knowledge management 113. Attention to knowledge management required. Knowledge management is an important feature for UNEP, considering its normative and policy-science-setting role. The most recent strategy for knowledge management covers the period 2014\u2013 2017. 89 There is internal consensus that this area requires further attention and improvement, which is confirmed by the fact that less than half of respondents to the JIU survey were satisfied with the current arrangements for knowledge management and knowledge-sharing (see table 15). This perception is supported by the formative evaluation of the delivery model, which highlighted issues such as a lack of centralized knowledge-sharing platforms, inconsistent knowledge management practices, and reliance on project- or division-specific systems rather than a unified organizational approach. Furthermore, there was no indication during the preparation of the review that the Knowledge Management Committee and the network of focal points mentioned in the strategy were functioning effectively.

The Chief Scientist plays an essential role in steering the knowledge management agenda, including for the development of a revised knowledge management strategy. An organization-wide approach should cover programmatic learning and scientific publications, as well as other knowledge products pertaining to administrative and support functions. It is expected that the elaboration of such a strategy would contribute to increasing the capacity of the organization to better identify and manage the information it produces or consolidates and would streamline knowledge-sharing across the organization and with its partners, enhancing its ability to effectively deliver its mandate.",

An organization-wide approach should cover programmatic learning and scientific publications, as well as other knowledge products pertaining to administrative and support functions. It is expected that the elaboration of such a strategy would contribute to increasing the capacity of the organization to better identify and manage the information it produces or consolidates and would streamline knowledge-sharing across the organization and with its partners, enhancing its ability to effectively deliver its mandate. As a matter of fact, in January 2023, the senior management team highlighted the potential benefits of a corporate approach in this area. The Inspector draws attention to the 2016 JIU system-wide review on knowledge management in the United Nations system, which provides further elements to be considered in this regard. 90 The Inspector believes that there are also opportunities to be explored in terms of knowledge management and knowledge-sharing with the secretariats of the multilateral environmental agreements. Additionally, knowledge-sharing between regional offices and country offices of success stories, adaptable across different geographical settings, could strengthen organizational cohesion and enhance the organization\u2019s effectiveness. 115. The implementation of the following recommendation is expected to enhance the effectiveness of knowledge management and knowledge-sharing within the organization. Recommendation 7 The Executive Director should approve, by the end of 2026, a comprehensive strategy to support an organization-wide approach to knowledge management and knowledge-sharing. C. Publications 116. Publications as UNEP scientific outputs. The positioning of UNEP in the global framework as a normative and science-driven organization in the field of environment underlines the importance of its scientific work for the delivery of its mandate. A new typology for publications and related processes were introduced in 2022, as described in the revised UNEP publications policy and guidelines. 91 These are of various types, ranging from technical reports and working papers to institutional publications such as the Emissions Gap Report. Furthermore, the importance of the spotlight publications is acknowledged by UNEP management as an organization-wide effort aimed at amplifying the impact of its publications. The Publications Committee is the body responsible for reviewing publication concepts, while the Publications Board (in practice dedicated meetings of the senior management team organized twice per year) approves or rejects the concepts. The number of approved concepts has trended downward from its peak of 206 concepts in 2021 to 26 in 2024. 117. Further improvements needed in the approach to publications. The Inspector acknowledges the focus on improving the approach to publications in recent years, one example in this regard being the automated system for publication management, which has been functioning since January 2024. However, JIU research __________________ 90 JIU/REP/2016/10. 91 UNEP publications policy (2022) and UNEP publications guidelines (2022). JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 25-10420 59 indicates that the planning of publications needs to be more aligned with actual delivery capacities. The Inspector observed that, until recently, the release rate of publications was not keeping up with the pace of concept approvals. For example, in the 2022\u20132023 period, the release rate of publications following approval of their concepts was around 20 per cent. The Inspector suggests that UNEP management carry out an assessment of the measures undertaken since 2024 aimed at ensuring better alignment between the publication release capacity of the organization and the number of approved publication concepts, to verify whether they produced a positive impact on the release rate without compromising the quality of the content. On the basis of the JIU review of the minutes of the Publications Board meetings and of the analysis conducted by the Chief Scientist on a sample of publications issued in 2023, several areas of possible improvement have been identified, including: (a) clearly identifying the audience for each publication; (b) strengthening the coordination between units and divisions to produce publication concepts and potentially merge the complementary ones; (c) ascertaining that new publications ensure accuracy and consistency with previously released ones; (d) extending the time allocated for discussing institutional publication priorities in the Publications Board meetings; and (e) developing the scientific drafting skills of staff through regular training on the topic.92 VIII.",

Information and communications technology 118. ICT governance framework. ICT governance is essential for the functioning of UNEP, since the organization operates in various locations and supports secretariats of the multilateral environmental agreements which may have developed their own ICT infrastructure and solutions. Globally, ICT policies of the United Nations Secretariat apply to UNEP, including the 2016 guidelines for the information and communications technology strategy. 93 Internally, a data and digital governance framework, which was endorsed by the senior management team in November 2023, structured the ICT governance framework into two workstreams: (a) the ICT Solutions Group chaired by the Chief of the Enterprise Solutions Section (Corporate Services Division); and (b) the Data and Product Group chaired by the Chief Digital Officer, who reports to the Executive Director. In 2023, the terms of reference of the ICT Solutions Group (taking over the functions of the former ICT committee) stated its responsibilities as identifying and prioritizing the organization-wide implementation of cost-efficient solutions and presenting recommendations to the senior management team to support data and digital governance. The review found that it was unclear whether the ICT Solutions Group was recommending or approving projects for digital products, as that point had not been sufficiently elaborated in its terms of reference. Regarding the Data and Product Group, on the basis of its terms of reference approved in 2025, the Group oversees the organization\u2019s digital transformation agenda, in alignment with the Data Strategy for Action by Everyone, Everywhere (2020).94 119. Integration of two workstreams. The Enterprise Solutions Section positions itself as a provider of software and systems solutions for internal and external use, such as web-based platforms, websites, applications and dashboard development, to assist UNEP units in the implementation of their activities. 95 The Inspector was __________________ 92 Report of the Chair of the Publications Committee, June 2023 (internal document). 93 A/69/517 and General Assembly resolution 69/262. 94 Data Strategy of the Secretary-General for Action by Everyone, Everywhere: With Insight, Impact and Integrity (2020). 95 For example, the weCollaborate website, the wedocs website, the travel portal, the concept approval group portal, the publications system, the open data portal, the Partner Portal, the JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 60 25-10420 informed that the capacity of the Section was affected by difficulties in recruiting for Professional positions and retaining international staff with the necessary ICT skills and experience. Consequently, the Section faced the risk of relying on short-term staff, consultants, individual contractors and national or international United Nations Volunteers (representing more than 60 per cent of the workforce of the Section in October 2024). This enables software development but does not ensure the institutional memory and knowledge required for the long-term maintenance of the applications. The Chief Digital Officer leads the digital transformations subprogramme, which is integrated into the medium-term strategy for 2022\u20132025 and has mostly an outward reach, seeking engagement with external stakeholders for digital products and outputs produced by the organization. Currently, the coordination between the digital transformations subprogramme and the work of the Enterprise Solutions Section is primarily at the working level. A reinforced coordination at a higher level is expected through the revised reporting line of the Chief of the Section to the Chief Digital Officer (dual reporting, in addition to the reporting to the Deputy Director of the Corporate Services Division). 120. ICT infrastructure and services. The United Nations Secretariat in New York is responsible for the provision of most of the ICT infrastructure, such as data servers and cloud hosting.

Some of the basic services (Internet access, email system, telephone services, servers, Umoja access, service desk, etc.) are provided by UNON. The Inspector draws attention to the security compliance maturity of UNEP, which is seen by some interviewees as still not fully in line with the guidelines of the United Nations Secretariat, especially in relation to security standards for UNEP- administered websites. This aspect is also monitored as part of the Executive Director\u2019s compact for 2024. 121. Fragmentation of ICT systems and tools. One point for attention is the fragmentation of systems and tools and the lack of integration of the systems used for information management in general. This issue was repeatedly brought to the attention of the Inspector, especially concerning the limited interoperability of internal platforms and, consequently, the duplication of work for reporting purposes. This was confirmed by the results of the JIU survey of staff members, presented in table 16, with only half of respondents affirming that the current level of integration of ICT systems facilitated efficiency and collaboration across UNEP. Dissatisfaction was expressed by many respondents in relation to related trainings and the use of Umoja. Furthermore, the siloed approach to ICT services and their development was an issue raised in relation to the multilateral environmental agreement secretariats, their staff being mostly dissatisfied with this aspect, in particular with the UNEP travel portal. In the past few years, UNEP management has taken some action in this regard with the development of several information management platforms gathering the outputs of the activity of these secretariats, such as the InforMEA and DaRT tools. __________________ United Nations Environment Assembly portal, the Committee of Permanent Representatives portal, and quarterly business review dashboards.

IX. Oversight A. Oversight structure 122. Oversight framework. The main components of the UNEP oversight framework are presented in figure XII. The Committee of Permanent Representatives is the main governing body entrusted with oversight responsibilities. UNEP, being part of the United Nations Secretariat, falls under the purview of: (a) OIOS, which is responsible for internal audits, investigations, inspections and evaluations; and (b) the Independent Audit Advisory Committee (IAAC), which advises the General Assembly on oversight matters by examining issues such as recommendations of oversight bodies, the effectiveness of internal oversight, management controls and risk management, financial reporting, and coordination among oversight bodies. 96 The Board of Auditors provides external assurance through independent and professional audit observations on financial and accounting issues for the United Nations funds and programmes and includes considerations on performance in management areas when found appropriate. JIU is mandated to provide independent external oversight with a focus on system-wide issues with the aim of improving management and administrative efficiency and strengthening coordination among United Nations system organizations. UNEP has also established its own Evaluation Office.

Between 2020 and 2024, OIOS conducted between one and three internal audits each year focusing on UNEP, which were selected through its risk- based approach. The audits examined management topics (delegation of authority, procurement, recruitment and subprogrammes) or focused on a specific organizational unit (headquarters divisions or regional offices). In addition, as presented in table 17, during the same period OIOS audited five secretariats of multilateral environmental agreements in relation to financial and administrative matters.

OIOS investigations. UNEP maintains a record of all allegations of prohibited conduct in the Case Management Tracking System of the United Nations Secretariat. On the basis of the information available in OIOS annual reports issued between 2020 and 2024, investigations related to fraud and misconduct allegations varied between two and five per year, as shown in table 18. In the past two years, most investigations JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 25-10420 63 were related to possible fraudulent practices. The research showed that most staff members know how to report prohibited conduct cases, but affiliate personnel less so. Both categories of the workforce have limited trust in how the reported cases are followed up and managed. To mitigate this perception, further measures could be taken to build the confidence of personnel towards reporting prohibited conduct cases to make sure that they are not overlooked or not reported on. Additionally, as UNEP is engaged with numerous implementing partners, the Inspector recalls the importance of having robust investigation clauses and provisions included in this type of partnership agreement.97 Table 18 Overview of investigations by the Office of Internal Oversight Services (period reported on July year n \u2013 June year n+1) 2020/21 2021/22 2022/23 2023/24 2 investigation reports 5 investigation reports and 1 investigation closure notice 2 investigation reports, 4 investigation closure notices and 1 investigation advisory report 5 investigation reports and 2 investigation closure notices Source: Prepared by JIU on the basis of OIOS annual reports (2025). 125. OIOS evaluations. As initiated by the Committee for Programme and Coordination,98 OIOS conducts an evaluation of UNEP every six years and follow-up triennial reviews of the implementation of recommendations contained therein. The Inspector consulted these reports and found them well-elaborated and providing useful indications on the relevance and the effectiveness of the organization, including its institutional arrangements and its management policies and practices. 99 Following the latest triennial review, the Inspector is pleased to acknowledge that the five recommendations are considered implemented by OIOS. Furthermore, UNEP is also scrutinized by OIOS when it undertakes evaluations of broader subjects within the purview of the United Nations Secretariat. 126. Joint Inspection Unit. The system for following up on JIU reports and recommendations, adopted by the General Assembly in 1999, applies to UNEP as a participating organization. Even if the practice has been erratic for many years, as described in a JIU report issued in 2024 on the consideration of and action taken on its reports and recommendations by United Nations system organizations, 100 the Inspector acknowledges that, following recent initiatives, UNEP has recorded an improved rate of implementation of JIU recommendations issued up to 2023. UNEP management communicated that a new review-specific procedure providing Member States with information on oversight recommendations, including those formulated by JIU, had been implemented since 2024.",

In preparing the present review, there was no evidence that the Environment Assembly had considered JIU reports in the past, not even the system- wide review on environmental governance in the United Nations system, which is a concern. In 2024, JIU suggested that the legislative organs and governing bodies of its participating organizations re-examine their processes for the consideration of and decision-making on JIU recommendations.101 B. Evaluation function of the United Nations Environment Programme 127. Evaluation framework. The UNEP Evaluation Office has been mandated, through several decisions of the predecessor of the Environment Assembly, to coordinate, conduct and oversee evaluation across the organization. In line with the principles stated for evaluation in the United Nations Secretariat, 102 the UNEP evaluation policy (2022) steers the evaluation function of UNEP, which is further operationalized through an evaluation operational strategy and an evaluation manual.103 Furthermore, the Office refers to the principles and professional practices set by the United Nations Evaluation Group, in which it is an active member. The Director of the Evaluation Office is appointed by and reports to the Executive Director, and may participate as observer to the meetings of the senior management team. 128. Capacity and resources of the evaluation function. The Evaluation Office budget amounted to $2.4 million for the year 2023 and originated in several funding sources. These were: (a) the regular budget, covering the positions of the Director and one Senior Evaluation Officer; (b) Environment Fund allocations, covering the positions of three Evaluation Officers and three support staff and other operational activities; (c) extrabudgetary funding covering four Evaluation Officer positions; and (d) extrabudgetary funding covering the costs of project evaluation consultants and associated expenditures. Each division has a focal point on evaluation matters. The resources of the Office increased in 2022 with amounts coming from extrabudgetary sources for covering the personnel costs needed to conform to the 100 per cent evaluation coverage of projects. In this regard, the Inspector notes as a good practice the compromise between this requirement and existing capacity, by which only 50 per cent of projects are subject to terminal evaluations, managed directly by the Evaluation Office, and the rest are subject to management-led reviews, managed by the programme/project officers and subsequently validated by the Office for quality assurance purposes. 129. Evaluation coverage and outputs. The UNEP Evaluation Office has the mandate to undertake evaluations of all programmes and projects of the Environment Fund, related trust funds, earmarked contributions and projects implemented by UNEP and funded by GEF and GCF and under various partnership agreements.104 The Office conducts several types of evaluations, as presented in table 19. In this regard, the Inspector makes the following observations: (a) The current distribution of resources towards strategic and cross-cutting evaluations (primarily originating from the Environment Fund) does not allow sufficient focus on this stream, as project, programmatic and portfolio assessments constitute the bulk of the work of the Office. UNEP management communicated that __________________ 101 Ibid., recommendation 2. 102 ST/AI/2021/3 and ST/SGB/2018/3. 103 UNEP evaluation policy (2022), and UNEP evaluation manual (revised in June 2022 and released in March 2023).",

JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 25-10420 65 efforts were being made to increase the staffing capacity of the Office and reduce its reliance on individual contractors. Consequently, the Inspector expects increased focus on cross-cutting and strategic evaluations in the future to support the management of the organization. Already a recent example is the formative evaluation of the implementation of the delivery model; (b) In line with the evaluation policy, all subprogrammes must be evaluated every six years. The Board of Auditors made remarks on this matter recently. UNEP management has provided information showing that the organization is on track to produce subprogramme evaluation reports within the expected time frame, albeit on a rolling basis over several cycles of strategic planning; (c) There were neither impact studies nor impact evaluations reported for the period reviewed due to restricted resources and possible limitations in data availability following project completion, as mentioned in paragraph 79 above on performance monitoring; (d) Regarding the validation process of the Evaluation Office on management- led reviews, introduced in 2023 through a revision to the UNEP evaluation policy, the Inspector examined the documents issued in 2024 and found that about a quarter of the self-assessment ratings by project managers were adjusted by the Evaluation Office. As the adjustments were mostly related to effectiveness, monitoring, reporting and other factors affecting performance criteria, regular briefings by the Evaluation Office to programme/project managers could be useful to provide guidance on how to correctly approach such criteria ratings; (e) The evaluation reports are not systematically distributed among Member States but are available on the website of the Office along with the management response. 105 Nonetheless, the Office summarizes the findings and conclusions deriving from the strategic evaluations in its biennial Evaluation Synthesis Reports, which are presented to the members of the Committee of Permanent Representatives and circulated to the Environment Assembly as an intersessional document.

In its latest United Nations Evaluation Dashboard, OIOS reviewed the four main components of the UNEP evaluation function (framework, resources, output and coverage, and report __________________ 105 See wedocs.unep.org. JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 66 25-10420 quality) and provided an overall positive assessment. 106 In 2022, when the revised evaluation policy was presented to the senior management team for endorsement, the Director of the Office framed the objectives of policy in terms of five main improvements: (a) developing and maintaining a strategic evaluation agenda; (b) enhancing the use of evaluation throughout the organization; (c) maintaining the quality of evaluation processes and products; (d) building capacity for management- led reviews; and (e) establishing a stable resource base and funding approach for the evaluation function. The Inspector observed overall progress on all these objectives; however, increased attention and further efforts would be needed for undertaking more strategic and corporate evaluations. 131. The implementation of the following recommendation is expected to strengthen the strategic contribution of the UNEP Evaluation Office to the overall functioning of the organization.",

The Inspector observed overall progress on all these objectives; however, increased attention and further efforts would be needed for undertaking more strategic and corporate evaluations. 131. The implementation of the following recommendation is expected to strengthen the strategic contribution of the UNEP Evaluation Office to the overall functioning of the organization. Recommendation 8 The Committee of Permanent Representatives should request the Evaluation Office to consider the inclusion of a higher number of strategic or corporate evaluations in its annual work programme and to report back on their findings and conclusions. C. Oversight issues 132. Measures to enhance oversight. In its 2023 report, IAAC expressed concern regarding the low acceptance rate of recommendations issued by the Board of Auditors and JIU by several entities within the purview of the Secretariat, including UNEP,107 a situation that has been remedied as regards JIU recommendations. The Inspector welcomes the recent attention given to these matters by UNEP governing bodies and its management and makes the following observations: (a) At the request of the participants of the tenth Annual Subcommittee meeting (2023), an initiative was launched for having a standing agenda item on the consideration of evaluation reports and audits at the formal quarterly meetings of the Committee of Permanent Representatives, complementing the presentations made at the Annual Subcommittee meetings. In its response to the JIU questionnaire, UNEP management indicated that the reports issued by JIU, the Board of Auditors and OIOS would be integrated in this new approach, and the Inspector considers that this could be extended to the IAAC reports, when they contain considerations relevant to UNEP. This is in line with the provision of Governing Council decision 75 (IV) which called for such regular communications with Member States.108 However, after analysing the summaries of the meetings of the Committee since 2023, the Inspector notes with concern that: (a) in several instances, the discussions on these topics were deferred to future meetings and sometimes were downgraded to an informal subcommittee meeting; and (b) when discussed, the topics were referring mostly to statistics or general procedural aspects and rarely addressed substantive content. However, in the report of the Executive Director to the Committee of Permanent Representatives at its 168th meeting, in December 2024, progress was observed in that the document __________________ 106 OIOS Inspection and Evaluation Division, evaluation study entitled \u201cUnited Nations Evaluation Dashboard 2020\u20132021\u201d, 18 May 2023. 107 Report of IAAC on its activities for the period from 1 August 2022 to 31 July 2023 (A/78/286), annex I. 108 A/31/25, annex I. JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 25-10420 67 included links to relevant audit reports. The implementation of this measure must be confirmed by strong, established and effective related practices, to ensure proper guidance from Member States to the UNEP secretariat. The Inspector stresses the importance of properly discussing in the formal meetings of the Committee the findings and conclusions of audit and evaluation reports and the management responses, especially as oversight issues are currently not discussed at the level of the Environment Assembly. In this context, the Inspector believes that consideration should be given to inviting OIOS, as an independent function, to present its findings and recommendations to the Committee, either in person or virtually, as was also suggested in a recent management and administration review of UN-Habitat that identified a similar challenge;109 (b) Oversight indicators have been added to various internal reporting mechanisms, including the quarterly business review reports and monthly reports; (c) The Operations and Risk Management Unit, established in 2022, was tasked with ensuring coordination of internal and external audits and to follow up on oversight recommendations. Despite its limited capacity, the team supports the auditors and organizes follow-up meetings with the focal points throughout the year to ensure timely escalation of issues and implementation of recommendations; (d) An agreement with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime was signed, and the system called UNITE for Evaluations was introduced in June 2025. This is expected to streamline the evaluation process and the tracking of compliance with management responses, currently representing a significant administrative burden. The initial investment is $60,000. 133. Oversight findings and recommendations.",

This is expected to streamline the evaluation process and the tracking of compliance with management responses, currently representing a significant administrative burden. The initial investment is $60,000. 133. Oversight findings and recommendations. The collaborative approach followed by the internal and external auditors leads to the acceptance by UNEP management of the majority of recommendations included in the final versions of their reports. The overall number of recommendations issued by the various oversight bodies since 2022 is presented in table 20. Information on the implementation rate of oversight recommendations issued by OIOS, the Board of Auditors and the UNEP Evaluation Office is included in the annual programme performance report within the set of indicators related to executive management. In the report for 2022\u20132023, the implementation rate for OIOS audit recommendations was 88 per cent, while for Board of Auditors recommendations it was only 42 per cent. The Inspector encourages UNEP management to continue to work towards improving the implementation rates of recommendations from external oversight bodies and to report respective acceptance rates in its annual reporting. As regards the monitoring of the implementation of recommendations stemming from UNEP evaluations, there are two distinct methods for tracking compliance: an internal tracking system for project evaluations; and a recommendations implementation plan for each strategic evaluation. The latter method was introduced in 2024, and the Inspector expects that it will facilitate monitoring and compliance with recommendations from strategic evaluations, as well as streamlining the collection of related information and periodic reporting to the Committee of Permanent Representatives. According to UNEP management, the rate of compliance with evaluation recommendations has increased since the inclusion of these rates in the quarterly business review, a statement also appearing in the synthesis report (2022\u2013 2023). __________________ 109 JIU/REP/2022/1, para. 171.

JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 25-10420 71 Annex II Methodology and response rates for surveys and questionnaires conducted during the review 1. In accordance with JIU standard practice for management and administration reviews, a series of online surveys and questionnaires were conducted from November 2024 to February 2025 to seek views and suggestions from various stakeholders. Four main audiences were invited to provide inputs to the review: (a) representatives of Member States; (b) all categories of UNEP personnel; (c) the heads of UNEP field and programme offices; and (d) the secretariats of the multilateral environmental agreements. Each survey comprised a combination of multiple-choice questions and open-ended questions to allow respondents to raise concerns, make suggestions and give qualitative feedback, as appropriate. Elements gathered complement inputs received through interviews and were inserted into the narrative as relevant. A. Survey addressed to Member States (November 2024\u2013January 2025) 2. Two separate surveys were directed to: (a) the participants of the sixth session of the United Nations Environment Assembly, distributed by UNEP management through the e-deleGATE system; and (b) the members of the Committee of Permanent Representatives, distributed by JIU.",

The questions addressed areas such as organizational effectiveness and efficiency, success in terms of delivering on the mandate, strategic planning and corporate priorities.

B. Surveys addressed to United Nations Environment Programme staff members and affiliate personnel (January\u2013February 2025) 3. The surveys gathered opinions from all categories of UNEP personnel, both staff and affiliate personnel (questions were adjusted for each audience). The participation rate of staff members was remarkable (including for the multilateral environmental agreements secretariats) and, overall, satisfactory for the affiliate workforce (see table 2). Among staff respondents, more than 61 per cent were internationally recruited staff in the Professional and higher categories and 65 per cent had more than six years of experience at UNEP. The open-ended contributions of respondents focused on issues such as: decision-making processes, with concerns about decisions being overly centralized, leading to micromanagement and inefficiencies; JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 72 25-10420 bureaucracy and the administrative burden, which overwhelm respondents; human resources management and recruitment, noting long recruitment processes and potential discrimination cases; and work environment and morale, with issues such as favouritism and low staff morale.

C. Questionnaire to heads of field and programme offices (November 2024\u2013January 2025) 4. The online questionnaire garnered views of field representatives (see table 3). Its response rate of almost 80 per cent is highly satisfactory. Respondents were mainly based in the Europe region, followed by Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean. 5. In the opinion of most respondents, UNEP has been successful in promoting international cooperation in the environment field and coordinating environmental matters at the global and regional levels, but less so at the country level. The evolution of financial resources of the organization in the past five years is perceived rather negatively, especially with regard to their predictability and flexibility. The respondents associate this with the introduction of the Policy for One UNEP Delivery for Better Collaboration and Country Support mostly considered to bring only some or little contribution to the implementation of the UNEP strategic objectives for the period 2022\u20132025. Although the delivery model lists resource mobilization and ensuring coherent delivery among the six main tasks of regional directors, these are seen as challenging and ranked last in terms of time devoted to them. Another evident challenge is the coordination aspect between regional offices and technical divisions in UNEP, which must be instrumental for the implementation of the delivery model. The delegation of authority topic was also highlighted as in need of efficiency improvements and more clarity.",

Respondents were mainly based in the Africa and Europe regions. Most respondents considered that the current administrative and financial support arrangements with UNEP were effective, but there was still room for improvement, especially with regard to: (a) the coordination between UNEP and UNON, which is perceived to negatively affect the timeliness of services provided; (b) increasing transparency on the end use of programme support costs retained by UNEP; and (c) strengthening the coordination at the senior management level between UNEP and the multilateral environmental agreement secretariats.

However, their rapid and widespread diffusion is often outpacing the ability of many Governments to respond. The Technology and Innovation Report 2025: Inclusive Artificial Intelligence for Development surveys the complex artificial intelligence landscape, aiming to help decision makers design science, technology and innovation policies that foster inclusive technological progress. The use of artificial intelligence has the potential to accelerate progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, but if unevenly distributed and not guided by ethical oversight and transparency, its diffusion can exacerbate existing inequalities. The report analyses the requirements and policies needed at all stages, from development to adoption, to foster inclusive technological progress for sustainable development. This requires a multidimensional and evidence-based approach. For this purpose, three key leverage points \u2013 infrastructure, data and skills \u2013 are identified, offering a broad socioeconomic perspective and highlighting the need to build resilient infrastructure and promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and innovation. The report starts by documenting the significant concentration in artificial intelligence development in a few companies and countries and identifies extensive gaps in digital infrastructure that risk widening inequalities both within and among countries. Then it explores productivity and workforce dynamics focusing on economic growth and decent work. From a national perspective, the report analyses the requirements and policies needed to support adoption, adaptation and development of artificial intelligence. From an international perspective, it considers the need for global artificial intelligence governance to steer artificial intelligence towards inclusive and equitable development, emphasizing the importance of international collaboration. History has shown that while technological progress drives economic growth, it does not on its own ensure equitable income distribution or promote inclusive human development. Stronger international cooperation can shift the focus from technology to people, enabling countries to co-create a global artificial intelligence framework. Such a framework should prioritize shared prosperity, create public goods and place humanity at the heart of artificial intelligence development.

Market power, research and development (R&D) investment, knowledge creation and the development and deployment of these technologies are dominated by technology giants from developed countries. Only 100 companies account for over 40 per cent of the world\u2019s business investment in R&D. China and the United States of America dominate knowledge generation in frontier technologies, with around one third of peer-reviewed articles and two thirds of patents. Similarly, there is a significant AI-related divide between developed and developing countries.",

China and the United States of America dominate knowledge generation in frontier technologies, with around one third of peer-reviewed articles and two thirds of patents. Similarly, there is a significant AI-related divide between developed and developing countries. This could widen existing inequalities and hinder efforts by developing countries to catch up. As a general-purpose technology, AI can enhance other technologies and enable effective human-machine collaboration. The use of AI offers significant opportunities for businesses and countries to grow and to progress towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. However, it also presents various risks and ethical concerns. Decision makers need to know more about AI if they are to navigate its promises and perils, for sustainable and inclusive development. Technology and Innovation Report 2025 \u00a9 Adobe Stock Leading technology companies are gaining control over the technology\u2019s future, and their commercial motives do not always align with the public interest. Governments need to explore policies and regulations that can incentivize and guide technological development along a path that promotes inclusivity and benefits everyone. Frontier technologies are capital intensive and could be labour-saving. In many developing countries, this could erode the comparative advantage of low labour costs, putting at risk the gains of recent decades. When properly directed, AI could help reverse this trend by augmenting rather than substituting for human capabilities. The rapid progress of AI involves three key leverage points that could trigger transformational cascades: infrastructure, data and skills. These provide a framework to assess a country\u2019s preparedness for AI, develop effective industrial and innovation policies and strengthen global AI governance and collaboration. Key policy takeaways 4 Frontier technologies, and AI in particular, are having a profound impact, reshaping not just production processes and labour markets but also the structure of societies. Their rapid and widespread diffusion has outpaced the ability of Governments to respond effectively. The present report aims to guide policymakers through the complex AI landscape and help them design science, technology and innovation (STI) policies that foster inclusive technological progress. The rapid diffusion of frontier technologies makes it difficult for Governments to keep up Catching up requires aligning industrial and STI policies to keep pace with rapidly evolving digital technologies This chapter presents the current state of frontier technologies and the global AI landscape, revealing significant disparities in countries\u2019 capacity to adopt, adapt and develop AI. This sets the stage for the rest of the report, which delves into the impact of AI on productivity and the workforce, and examines the promises and perils of AI applications for developing countries, through case studies in different sectors. For a new technology to reach its full potential, a number of conditions must be fulfilled. The spread of electricity, for example, relied on national power grids, and the success of the Internet depended on fibre-optic networks with cables crossing continents and ocean beds. The transformations brought by new technologies also depend on the willingness and capacity to redesign factories and business processes worldwide. Taking advantage of AI systems requires even more robust broadband infrastructure that can carry massive flows of data, and building essential programming and other skills. This report assesses national AI readiness and capacity based on the three critical leverage points: infrastructure, data and skills. With regard to AI adoption and development, many developing countries are still in the early stages and lack dedicated strategies or instruments to address AI-specific needs. The report shows how Governments can strengthen their AI capabilities, steer AI adoption and development and seize opportunities, by presenting good practices and lessons learned of national efforts. Catching up requires the alignment of industrial and STI policies, to keep pace with the constant redefinition of competitiveness due to digital technologies and innovation. AI also poses challenges at the transnational level, with the potential to exacerbate existing inequalities between and within countries and to undermine global efforts towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.",

AI also poses challenges at the transnational level, with the potential to exacerbate existing inequalities between and within countries and to undermine global efforts towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. As this report shows, international governance of AI is still fragmented. Strengthening and harmonizing it requires deeper international cooperation. Working together, Governments can co-create an inclusive global framework that fosters accountability, international collaboration and capacity- building. Only an inclusive approach to AI governance can ensure shared prosperity. 5 Chapter I AI at the technology frontier Frontier technologies may increase sixfold in the next decade, reaching $16.4 trillion in value Figure I.1 Three broad categories of frontier technologies Source: UNCTAD. Abbreviations: 5G, fifth-generation; 3D, three-dimensional; PV, photovoltaics.

Rapid expansion of frontier technologies Frontier technologies are those advanced and emerging technologies \u2013 from AI to green hydrogen and gene editing \u2013 that have strong transformative potential and offer new opportunities for economic development, sustainability and governance (UNCTAD, 2018). These technologies help solve complex problems, allow time-consuming undertakings to be carried out more efficiently and offer potential for scalability and fast diffusion. In this way, frontier technologies play a key role in creating and implementing global solutions to address the challenges of the twenty-first century. This section provides an update of the status of 17 frontier technologies presented in the previous edition of the Technology and Innovation Report (UNCTAD, 2023). As in that report, they can be divided into three broad categories: industry 4.0, green and renewable energy technologies and other frontier technologies (figure I.1). The market potential for frontier technologies One measure by which to assess frontier technologies is their market size, namely, the total revenue generated from the sales of products and services in the market. Frontier technologies represented a $2.5 trillion market in 2023 and are estimated to increase sixfold in the next decade, reaching $16.4 trillion by 2033 (figure I.2). This translates into a compound annual growth rate of around 20 per cent, in line with the projection in the previous edition of the Technology and Innovation Report that covers the period between 2020 and 2030. Different frontier technologies often overlap and interact with each other, and it is therefore difficult to make clear distinctions for their markets and there may be some double counting. Nevertheless, these technologies are already being deployed on a substantial scale and present strong market potential. 6 Figure I.2 Rapid expansion of frontier technologies (Market size estimates, billions of dollars) Source: UNCTAD based on various online market research reports (see annex I). Note: Market size data capture the revenue generated by the sales of products and services.

Continuous breakthroughs are making AI more powerful and efficient, favouring its adoption in many sectors and business functions (Facts and Factors, 2024). Since 2022, there has been for example, a surge in interest in Generative AI (GenAI), with organizations across different countries and industries experimenting with its use in a wide range of tasks, including content creation, product development, automated coding and personalized customer service (Accenture, 2023; McKinsey & Company, 2023). Another major market is the Internet of Things (IoT).",

Another major market is the Internet of Things (IoT). By 2033, this growing network of physical devices connecting and exchanging data could contribute $3.1 trillion to the global economy (Global Data, 2024). IoT, coupled with other Industry 4.0 technologies and AI, will accelerate the digital transformation of agriculture, manufacturing and services, increasing productivity and product quality while potentially reducing costs and carbon emissions (Kumar et al., 2021; Matin et al., 2023). These technologies can also benefit consumers if enhanced human- machine interactions lead to more efficient and customized solutions. By 2033, AI will have the largest share, almost one third of the frontier technologies market 7 Chapter I AI at the technology frontier The market dominance of tech giants The leading frontier technology providers are now among the largest corporations in the world by market capitalization. Apple, Nvidia and Microsoft each have a market capitalization of more than $3 trillion, close to the gross domestic product (GDP) of the African continent, or that of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the world\u2019s sixth largest economy. Not far behind are Alphabet (Google) and Amazon, with market capitalizations of above $2 trillion, greater than the GDP of Canada.1 The top five companies are from the United States, and three leading chipmakers \u2013 Nvidia, Broadcom and TSMC2 \u2013 are among the world\u2019s top 10 listed companies; almost all are focused on frontier technologies and invest substantially in AI (figure I.3). 1 Market capitalization data are as at end-2024 (Companies Market Cap, 2024). GDP figures are from the UNCTADstat database. GDP is a flow variable and market capitalization is a stock variable; the present comparison is for illustrative purposes only, to highlight the significant market size of leading technology companies. 2 Nvidia and Broadcom, United States; TSMC, Taiwan Province of China. 3 There is no structured, reliable information about market share or company profit readily available for frontier technologies. The top frontier technology providers were identified through an online search of companies most commonly referred to as top providers. Since the search was conducted in English, more favourable results may have been returned for companies from English-speaking countries. The main providers of frontier technologies are from the United States, developed countries in Western Europe, China, Japan and the Republic of Korea. Collecting globally comparable data on frontier technology markets is challenging, but some trends can be identified.3 Companies in the United States have an edge in digital technologies and computing platforms, such as AI, IoT, big data, blockchain and 3D printing. Companies from Japan lead in robotics development and those from the Republic of Korea are more active in 5G and nanotechnologies. Companies in Western Europe cover a wide spectrum of frontier technologies. Among developing countries, the dominant player is China, which leads technological development in 5G, drones and solar photovoltaics (solar PV). There are only a few top frontier technology providers from other developing countries, for example, Brazil (e.g. some biofuels companies). Leading technology giants each have market capitalizations of over $3 trillion, comparable to the GDP of the entire African continent Figure I.3 Market dominance of technology giants Top 10 listed companies in the world by market capitalization (Trillions of dollars) Source: UNCTAD, based on data from Companies Market Cap.

Some have developed the technology in-house and most stay at the frontier by investing in startups or acquiring highly innovative firms that offer cutting-edge technology and expertise. For example, in 2014, Alphabet acquired DeepMind, a leading United Kingdom-based research lab pioneering the field of deep reinforcement learning that developed the programme \u2018AlphaGo\u2019 that defeated the world Go champion in 2016. Another major player is Microsoft that, in 2019, forged a partnership with OpenAI, which developed ChatGPT (GPT stands for generative pre-trained transformer), and in 2022, made a record acquisition, for more than $18 billion, of Nuance Communications, a company that specializes in large- scale speech applications and is behind the Siri voice assistant of Apple.4 Market dominance is worrying, particularly in winner-takes-all markets, because the top players reap most of the rewards and 4 For a list of the largest AI acquisitions of United States companies, see Bratton, 2024. have the resources to eliminate potential competition or even control the flows of information and revenue (UNCTAD, 2021). Leading technology companies are gaining control over our technology future, but their commercial motives may not always align with the public interest and could put societies on a suboptimal development trajectory (Ahmed et al., 2023; Oxfam International, 2024). For instance, studies suggest that companies generally direct AI development towards substituting for human labour rather than augmenting human capabilities (Acemoglu and Johnson, 2023). Labour-saving and capital-intensive frontier technologies could undermine the comparative advantage of low labour costs in many developing countries, threatening much of the gains they have made in recent decades (Korinek et al., 2021). For these reasons, it is essential to explore policies and regulations that incentivize and guide technology firms towards a path that promotes inclusivity and benefits for everyone. Chapter IV presents an overview of STI and industrial policies for AI at the national level. Chapter V focuses on global AI governance. B. Concentration of research and development The potential of frontier technologies has attracted significant research and development investments. For example, between 2022 and 2025, AI- related investment was expected to double to $200 billion (Goldman Sachs, 2023). By comparison, this is about three times the global spending on climate change adaptation. By 2030, AI-related investment could represent 2 per cent of GDP in countries leading in AI (Goldman Sachs, 2023). While many companies undertake various forms of R&D, the bulk of investment is by a small number of enterprises. In 2022, more than 80 per cent of business- funded R&D worldwide was carried out by 2,500 companies, which invested \u20ac1.25 trillion; 40 per cent of such investment was by only 100 companies (European Commission, Joint Research Centre, 2023). How to direct frontier technology providers towards progress that benefits all? 100 companies account for over 40% of world business investment in R&D 9 Chapter I AI at the technology frontier Figure I.4 Significant concentration of research and development in a few countries (Share of investment by global top 100 corporate R&D investors, by country; percentage) Source: European Commission, Joint Research Centre, 2023. 2022 2012 United States of America China Germany Japan Republic of Korea Switzerland United Kingdom 49 39 13 2 12 11 8 20 4 4 4 6 3 3 Among the largest 100 corporate R&D investors, around half are headquartered in the United States, led by Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and Apple.

Other than China, none of the top 100 corporate R&D investors are from developing countries. The software and computer services industry, in which most AI, big data and blockchain technologies are developed, accounted for around one quarter of the total R&D investment of the top 100 corporate R&D investors in 2022, more than doubling their share from a decade ago and overtaking the pharmaceuticals and biotechnology industry (figure I.5).",

Other leading companies operate in the technology hardware and equipment industry, which includes IoT, 5G networks, 3D printing, robotics, drone technology and green frontier technologies, and accounts for one fifth of the R&D investment. The automobile and parts industry, which includes electric vehicles, still represents a considerable share of R&D investment despite a gradual decrease over the past decade. The software and computer services, technology hardware and equipment and pharmaceuticals and biotechnology industries are largely headquartered in the United States, which accounts for more than 80 per cent of the corporate R&D investment in software and computer services. Germany and Japan lead in such investment in automobiles and parts and the Republic of Korea is strong in electronic and electrical equipment. 10 C. Asymmetries in knowledge creation Knowledge creation in frontier technologies has been gathering pace, with a rapid rise in research publications and patents. Over the period 2000\u20132023, for AI alone, more than 713,000 peer-reviewed scientific articles were published and 338,000 patents were filed, with a sharp increase since 2020. Other industry 4.0 technologies, such as IoT, robotics and big data, also generated a large number of publications and patents. Among green technologies, knowledge creation was more significant in biogas and biomass (274,000 patents) and in electric vehicles (243,000 patents) (figure I.6). As with R&D investments, knowledge creation in frontier technologies is dominated by China and the United States, which together are responsible for around one third of global peer-reviewed articles and two thirds of patents. These countries are more dominant in patents than scientific articles. Different countries often specialize in particular fields. This is evident in the revealed technology advantage of a country, that is defined as its share of patents in a particular technology field divided by its share in all fields (table I.1). A value above 1 indicates specialization. For example, Germany is highly specialized in wind energy, India in nanotechnology, Japan in electric vehicles, and the Republic of Korea in 5G technology. Certain countries or regions may become global hubs for particular types of knowledge, attracting investment and talent, and giving them an edge in shaping the technological trajectory.

The growing complexity of technologies and innovations requires increasing investments in physical and human capital, to find new ideas, as well as greater adjustment and learning costs for effective implementation. In addition, modern technologies need to be integrated with multiple components within increasingly interconnected systems, further raising entry barriers and limiting technology and knowledge diffusion. The gap in productivity growth between firms at the global frontier and laggards is particularly marked in digital and skill- intensive industries (Berlingieri et al., 2020).",

The slowdown in technology diffusion also limits aggregate productivity growth. Technology development and innovation in developing countries can also be hindered by data and intellectual property policies in developed countries, with the risk of the diffusion of AI technology further widening existing gaps. 12 Patents USA China Germany India Korea Japan Industry 4.0 frontier technologies AI 1.2 0.8 1.3 1.7 1.1 1.4 IoT 0.6 1.3 0.2 2.3 1.4 0.3 Big data 0.1 1.7 0.0 0.4 0.9 0.1 Blockchain 1.2 1.0 0.4 0.8 1.0 0.6 5G 0.4 1.0 0.1 0.2 4.4 0.2 3D printing 0.8 1.2 1.5 0.2 0.5 0.2 Robotics 2.5 0.5 0.9 0.9 0.3 1.0 Drone 1.0 1.0 0.8 0.7 1.6 0.7 Green frontier technologies Solar PV 0.2 1.6 0.0 0.8 0.5 0.4 Concentrated solar power 2.8 0.1 1.5 1.7 0.2 1.8 Biofuels 2.1 0.3 0.8 0.9 0.5 0.7 Biogas and biomass 1.0 0.9 1.2 0.6 0.3 0.9 Wind energy 0.3 1.2 4.3 0.5 0.2 0.2 Green hydrogen 0.7 1.1 1.0 1.5 0.8 0.4 Electric vehicles 0.7 1.0 1.3 0.4 1.5 3.0 Other frontier technologies Nanotechnology 1.3 0.5 0.9 3.0 0.4 0.3 Gene editing 2.9 0.6 0.6 0.0 0.3 0.6 Table I.1 Revealed technology advantage of selected countries based on filed patent, 2000\u20132023 Source: UNCTAD calculations, based on data from PatSeer.

D. Evolution of AI 5 In the seminal paper \u201cComputing Machinery and Intelligence\u201d, the concept of the Turing test was introduced, whereby if a human evaluator could not distinguish the written responses of a machine from those of a human, the machine would pass the test and be considered as exhibiting intelligent behaviour equivalent to that of a human (Turing, 1950). To help in understanding the promises and perils of AI, the following sections discuss different waves of AI and the intersection of AI with other technologies. There is no universal definition of AI, but it is generally considered to be the capability of a machine to engage in cognitive activities similar to those performed by the human brain, such as reasoning, learning and problem-solving (Collins et al., 2021). The notion originated in the 1940s as part of the concept of machine intelligence by Alan Turing, who suggested that machines could simulate both mathematical deduction and formal reasoning.5 The term artificial intelligence was coined in 1956 for the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence (McCarthy et al., 2006). 13 Chapter I AI at the technology frontier Since then, progress has been uneven and can be considered to have taken place in three waves (figure I.8). The first was in the 1950s and the 1960s, when AI developed rapidly as a rule-based system that used a set of predetermined \u201crules of choices\u201d to make decisions and solve problems. Progress slowed in the 1970s due to a lack of computational power and scalability, the first \u201cAI winter\u201d. There was a brief thaw in the 1980s, when expert systems mimicking the human decision- making process became popular. However, as these systems showed the same limitations as earlier systems, interest and funding in AI diminished once again. 6 For example, machine learning emerged as a subset of AI that use statistical techniques to detect patterns and make predictions based on the data. Big data and the rise of deep learning further propelled significant advancements. The second wave started in the 1990s, based on statistical learning. By analysing large quantities of data, machines could revise rules and provide more flexibility.",

Big data and the rise of deep learning further propelled significant advancements. The second wave started in the 1990s, based on statistical learning. By analysing large quantities of data, machines could revise rules and provide more flexibility. The resurgence in AI research and application was driven by three major forces, namely, increasing computational power at low cost, unprecedented data volumes and more sophisticated and efficient algorithms.6 One landmark was the launch in 2007 of ImageNet, a large-scale system for image recognition based on millions of human-annotated images (Deng et al., 2009). A second was the creation of the digital assistant Siri in 2011. A third, in 2016, was the defeat of the world Go champion by a computer programme. Figure I.8 The three waves of AI Source: UNCTAD, based on various estimates (see note below). Note: Graphics processing units (GPUs) were initially designed for computer graphics and image processing but later became useful in non-graphic calculations and have been widely used in training AI models. GPU performance is expressed in terms of floating-point operations (flops) per second per dollar, adjusted for inflation. The curve represents the best fitted line based on data from 2000 to 2020 and extrapolated figures between 2020 and 2025 (Hobbhahn and Besiroglu, 2022). For the amount of data generated, figures for before 2010 are extrapolated based on the estimates from 2010 to 2025 (Taylor, 2023). 1950 1955 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 2020 2025 0 20 40 60 80 100 0 40 80 120 160 200 First wave: Rule-based Second wave: Statistical learning Third wave: Contextual adaptation Turing test AI was coined Expert systems ImageNet Siri AlphaGo ChatGPT DALL-E Sora Generative AI Big data, machine learning, deep learning Data generated (left axis) GPU performance (right axis) Data generated (zettabytes) GPU performance (billion \ufb02ops/s/$) 14 Nevertheless, at this stage, AI was largely confined to specific tasks within limited domains and did not possess human-like intelligence. This is considered narrow artificial intelligence, or weak AI (Collins et al., 2021). The third and current wave gathered momentum in the 2020s, with the use of significant computer power for systems not only based on rules but seeking contextual adaptation or factoring in contexts and explaining decisions. Recent years have seen the emergence of GenAI, driven by advances in natural language processing and large language models, along with exponential growth in computational power and data. This differs from discriminative or predictive AI, which typically analyses and classifies data for particular outcomes such as pattern recognition. GenAI instead mostly identifies relationships in large amounts of data and uses these to create new content. However, this is at the cost of explainability, as it may be difficult to understand the decision-making logic behind a model\u2019s results because it is probabilistic, and the same conditions or inputs might subsequently produce different outputs. GenAI is trained on huge data sets and uses complex algorithms to generate statistically probable outputs, as well as new content that resembles existing data, whether in the form of texts, images or videos.7 Public interest in AI was fuelled by the launch of the online application ChatGPT in 2022 by OpenAI. Other examples are DALL-E, which creates images from text, and Sora, which has been conceived for video creation. The growing capabilities and adaptability of AI represent a paradigm shift that is transforming it into a general- purpose technology configurable for different uses (Dhar, 2023; box I.1). 7 GenAI is a subset of deep learning, which utilizes multilayer neural networks to automate data analysis from large unstructured data sets. Between 2024 and 2030, the GenAI market is predicted to grow from $137 billion to $900 billion, a compound annual growth rate of 37 per cent (Bloomberg, 2023). Expectations are high, comparable to the enthusiasm in the late 1990s that boosted investment during the initial diffusion of the Internet. Nevertheless, there are still high levels of uncertainty. Evidence of the impact of GenAI applications and how they could be best utilized remains limited, particularly in developing countries, and further research and observation is required. Moreover, AI applications are valuable but not infallible.",

Moreover, AI applications are valuable but not infallible. If the training data are incomplete or biased, the model may learn incorrect patterns, make inaccurate predictions or hallucinate to offer information that is not present in the training data or that contradicts a user\u2019s prompt. The rapid development of GenAI has reignited the expectation of developing artificial general intelligence or \u201dstrong AI\u201d that could even surpass human intelligence and operate autonomously. AI has already outperformed humans in handwriting, speech and image recognition, as well as in reading comprehension and language understanding (figure I.9). However, human intelligence is complex and multifaceted; it may be more challenging than expected to achieve artificial general intelligence. The driving forces behind the rapid progress of AI in recent decades involve three key leverage points, that can trigger transformational cascades for AI, namely, infrastructure, data and skills; infrastructure in the form of increasing computational power and cost-effective information transfers; data, with regard to the massive and diverse amounts of quality data produced at accelerating speeds; and skills in the form of advanced expertise in developing and applying sophisticated AI models. The present report provides evidence with regard to these three key leverage points. Breakthroughs in AI are transforming it into a general- purpose technology 15 Box I.1 Is AI a general-purpose technology? \u00a9 Phonlamai Photo - Shutterstock 15 General-purpose technologies lead to new methods of production and innovation, transform industries and create new markets over decades. Such technologies are characterized by: \u2022 Pervasiveness \u2013 They offer applications across various industries and economic activities. \u2022 Dynamicity \u2013 They offer room for continuous technical improvements that create new opportunities for applications. \u2022 Innovational complementarities \u2013 They enable innovations in application sectors and new complementary technologies developed around them. AI is considered a general-purpose technology because it can impact a wide range of tasks and jobs. AI is continuously evolving, with growing functionality, and may affect around half of human jobs in the future. Moreover, AI is already transforming the way research and innovation are conducted. While it can speed up processes, it is unclear whether the use of AI can help address the increasing difficulties in discovering new ideas and the decreasing rate of the emergence of disruptive ideas. In any case, as with previous general-purpose technologies, it will take time and effort for the full potential of AI to be realized. For example, the introduction of electric motors in manufacturing initially boosted productivity by reducing energy costs, but the most significant impacts did not emerge until companies began to redesign factories and business processes to take advantage of the flexibilities offered by the new source of energy. Rather than being final solutions, general-purpose technologies open up new opportunities and feedback loops throughout the economy. However, the complementary productive and innovative activities are usually widely dispersed, making it difficult to coordinate efforts and provide incentives within both the technology and the application sectors.

They also comprise computing power and server capabilities, such as significant storage, network connectivity, security and backup systems. These are needed to process huge amounts of data, run algorithms, execute models and transmit results worldwide. Data \u2013 Data are the primary input for the training, validation and testing of algorithms, thereby enabling AI models to classify inputs, generate outputs and make predictions. Data are therefore a critical socioeconomic asset in decision-making processes. High- quality, diverse and unbiased data are essential in building effective and trustworthy AI systems.

Data and AI systems interact dynamically, whereby more data provide more training for an AI model, making it more popular and thus capable of collecting (and generating) more data.8 This dynamic and scale effects could widen existing data- related and technological gaps, creating higher entry barriers for latecomers. 8 For example, Chat GPT-4 uses 45 gigabytes of training data, around three times that used by GPT-3, and was trained using reinforcement learning with human feedback on Microsoft Azure AI supercomputers. The number of parameters increased from 1.5 billion for GPT-2 to 175 billion for GPT-3 and estimates suggest that the number of parameters for GPT-4 are around 1.77 trillion, 10 times those of its predecessor (Heaven, 2023). Skills \u2013 Skills range from basic data literacy to the use or development of appropriate techniques, algorithms and models, and from proficiency in data analysis to a combination of technical expertise and domain knowledge. Such skills empower the workforce to use AI to solve complex problems and increase productivity. These three leverage points create synergistic, positive feedback loops. More affordable and powerful computational resources enable the processing of vast and complex data sets, allowing sophisticated algorithms to analyse and learn from data more effectively, which in turn accelerates the adoption and development of AI, thereby generating more data. The abundance of diverse data provides a rich foundation for training AI models, enhancing their ability to generalize and perform well in different scenarios and across different tasks. At the same time, advanced algorithms optimize the use of computational power and data, leading to more rapid and efficient AI development. This dynamic interaction fosters continuous improvement and innovation in AI technologies (figure I.10).

Synergy between AI and other technologies Compared with earlier AI waves, the current AI surge has greater depth and breadth of penetration, with AI technology having a wide range of potential applications in different fields. AI is already embedded in our daily life and serves as a general-purpose technology that augments other technologies (Damioli et al., 2024). The intersection of AI with other frontier technologies opens up opportunities for innovation, including the following (figure I.11): IoT \u2013 Connected devices, given a further boost by AI, can analyse data, make decisions and take actions with minimal human intervention, to create an artificial intelligence of things. This is becoming the basis of smart factories. Combined with the 5G networks that support higher-speed connections with lower latency, this can lead to intelligent connectivity (Yarali, 2021). Smart transportation, for example, enables vehicles to communicate in real time on road conditions and accidents, for better traffic control and management. Big data \u2013 There is a strong synergy between AI and big data. AI can improve data analysis and pattern recognition, while big data can be used in training models. Video surveillance systems, for example, can process large amounts of video and sensor data, to identify anomalies or patterns of interest. AI can augment other technologies 18 Figure I.11 AI augments other frontier technologies Source: UNCTAD.",

AI provides better data analytics to improve or develop new solutions, for example, detecting threats and fraudulent activities and optimizing inventory levels and routing. Blockchain augments AI-based security measures with linked cryptographic authentication and decentralized computing power and data processing (Ekramifard et al., 2020). 3D printing \u2013 Human designers can explore feasible options for 3D printing by running many different design scenarios and carrying out virtual stress tests. Less experienced designers can also benefit from GenAI- driven tools, such as Style2Fab and 3D-GPT that facilitate design and development processes (Zewe, 2023; Sun et al., 2023). 9 For example, in 2023, a drone developed by the University of Zurich performed better than human competitors in a physical drone race for the first time (Swissinfo, 2023). 10 It is estimated that AI has more greenhouse gas emissions than the global airline industry and data centres account for around 1 per cent of global electricity demand. Nevertheless, AI could lead to a 4 per cent reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 from efficiency improvements alone (The United Nations Economic and Social Council, 2024). Robotics and drones \u2013 AI can reinforce the capacity of robots to learn and make decisions and execute tasks in dynamic conditions. AI-powered industrial robots are widely used in manufacturing. AI also helps with crop-harvesting in agriculture (Birrell et al., 2020). Similarly, AI enables drones to operate autonomously and adapt to changing scenarios, making them more efficient and versatile.9 Green frontier technologies \u2013 The use of AI models can consume significant amounts of energy, but can also help unlock the potential of clean energy and accelerate decarbonization.10 For example, the use of AI can optimize the use and management of renewable energy through smart grids and the storage and distribution of energy from renewable sources (Rozite et al., 2023). 19 Chapter I AI at the technology frontier Nanotechnology and gene editing \u2013 AI is widely used in nanotechnology and gene editing, including in autonomous nanorobots, for material design and discovery, and AI-driven genetic research (Dixit et al., 2024). The salient features of AI, from data analytics, natural language processing and automation to the latest breakthroughs in content generation and contextual adaptation, make it a general-purpose technology that can also augment mature technologies and be configured to dedicated uses.11 A compelling capability of AI is its ability to learn and adapt. It is also possible to have a smaller (and less capable) model supervising a more complex and capable one, known as \u201cweak to strong generalization\u201d. This offers a scalable way for humans to guide and control complex AI models by using more easily understandable AI models (Burns et al., 2023). 11 For example, in China, the AI Plus initiative emphasizes the deep integration of AI with the real economy, highlighting its broad applicability across various sectors (Xinhua News Agency, 2024). A fifth industrial revolution AI may be considered the latest in a sequence of industrial revolutions, all of which have reshaped production systems (figure I.12).",

A fifth industrial revolution AI may be considered the latest in a sequence of industrial revolutions, all of which have reshaped production systems (figure I.12). In the 1800s, during the first industrial revolution, the power of human labour was expanded by the spread of a range of new technologies, including spinning machinery and the steam engine. The second industrial revolution in the 1900s was driven by the diffusion of electrical power and standardization of machine tools, which led to mass production. The third industrial revolution began in the 1970s with the introduction of computers and electronics, which increased the speed of information processing, for the further automation of production processes and the advent of the service economy. The fourth industrial revolution, since the 2000s, often referred to as Industry 4.0, has leveraged the diffusion of the Internet and mobile devices to integrate cyber and physical systems, multiplying the quantity of information produced and its potential uses. A distinctive feature of AI is its ability to amplify human intelligence. Intelligent machines allow for more effective human and robot collaboration that may spark a fifth industrial revolution (box I.2). A new wave of technological transformation will reshape the economy and society. For example, there is the risk that the use of AI will replace many workers while not creating enough new jobs, and may also widen job polarization and increase income inequality. Chapter II discusses the importance of inclusive AI adoption that puts workers at the centre of technological development. AI could spark a fifth industrial revolution, in which humans and intelligent machines collaborate Figure I.12 Industrial revolutions and their transformative changes Source: UNCTAD. 1800s 1900s 1970s 2000s 2020s Power Scale Speed Data and connectivity Intelligence Mechanization, water and steam powers Industry 1.0 Mass production, electric power Industry 2.0 Computers and electronics, automated production Industry 3.0 Cyber-physical systems, IoT Industry 4.0 Human-robot collaboration Industry 5.0 20 Box I.2 Key features of the fifth industrial revolution \u00a9 Gorodenkoff - Shutterstock 20 The concept of the fifth industrial revolution is still evolving, but it can be distinguished from the fourth industrial revolution by three key features, namely, human\u2013machine collaboration, sustainability and personalization. These elements point to a future that can be more inclusive and sustainable, but achieving this vision requires deliberate effort and action. \u2022 Human\u2013machine collaboration \u2013 As opposed to the automation focus of the fourth industrial revolution, it focuses on human\u2013machine collaboration, or human-centric co-creation. This involves redirecting technological advances towards serving humanity, prioritizing collaboration and co-creation between humans and machines. Rather than focusing solely on efficiency it aims to promote dynamic and inclusive production systems that enhance human well-being. Rather than asking which new technological solution is feasible, the question should be why such a solution is being developed; what human and societal needs does it address and how does it help solve them? \u2022 Sustainability \u2013 While prioritizing worker well-being and competitiveness, in the fifth industrial revolution, sustainability is also considered, with industry playing an increasing role in providing solutions to societal challenges. This aligns with a shift toward digitalization, to create more sustainable and environmentally friendly business and consumer practices. \u2022 Personalized products and services \u2013 The fifth industrial revolution can use the advanced capacity of AI to analyse vast amounts of data on individual preferences and behaviours to create highly personalized products and services. Innovations such as GenAI and chatbots have transformed marketing practices, allowing companies to deliver tailored experiences in near real-time. The impact of personalization extends beyond improving consumer satisfaction; it can also be a way to enhance the well-being of workers, communities and the planet.

Technology and Innovation Report 2025 Inclusive Artificial Intelligence for Development 21 Chapter I AI at the technology frontier F. The AI divide 12 For example, an alliance between BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners, MGX and Microsoft, plans to mobilize up to $100 billion to invest in data centres and supporting power infrastructure (Microsoft, 2024). 13 In June 2024, Nvidia also became the largest company in the world by market capitalization, at $3.3 trillion (Companies Market Cap, 2024). 14 The computational power ranking is based on the sixty-third edition of the Top500 list, in which supercomputers are ordered primarily by their Rmax value, which represents the maximum Linpack performance achieved, measured in trillions of floating-point operations per second. History shows that technological shifts generally begin with upgrades in hardware and infrastructure, for example, from mainframes to personal computers, from landlines to mobile devices and from intranets to the Internet. This enables additional capabilities, including software and services, and facilitates the adoption and further development of technologies. The different phases are not linear; they usually overlap and create feedback loops that take years to mature and for society to realize their full potential. Currently, the diffusion of AI applications is associated with investment to upgrade critical AI infrastructure components such as semiconductors, data centres and supercomputers. These support high-speed processing, significant data-handling and advanced computation.12 During a gold rush, the most likely winners are often those who sell shovels. In the AI boom, one of the main winners has been Nvidia, the world\u2019s largest semiconductor company. In 2023, based on high expectations of revenue growth, its market capitalization more than tripled to $1.2 trillion, and it nearly tripled again in 2024.13 The surge in AI has also benefited other top semiconductor companies, which have experienced significant growth since 2023, notably, Advanced Micro Devices, ASML, Broadcom, Samsung and TSMC. Supercomputers and data centres Most of the leading semiconductor companies are from the United States and other developed economies, and there is a remarkable divide between developing and developed countries in other components of AI infrastructure. The United States has around one third of the top 500 supercomputers and more than half of overall computational performance (TOP500, 2024). China ranks second, with 80 of the top 500 supercomputers, although its total computational performance is less than one tenth that of the United States.14 A similar situation is seen with regard to data centres, with most of them located in the United States (Data Center Map, 2024). Few developing countries have powerful supercomputers or large data centres, apart from Brazil, China, India and the Russian Federation. Most developing countries have limited capacities in AI hardware and infrastructure, which hinder their adoption and development of AI. Chapter III presents an assessment of countries\u2019 preparedness for AI. 22 Services providers The market of AI services providers is also dominated by companies based in the United States, for example, Amazon, Alphabet, IBM, Microsoft and OpenAI, and by those based in China, including Baidu and Tencent. The private sector is responsible for most frontier AI research and produces most machine-learning models, leaving Governments and academia some way behind, with less than half combined (Maslej et al., 2024). This is partly because of escalating costs. Since 2016, the cost of training frontier AI models has increased 2.4 times per year (figure I.13). More than half of the development cost is directed to hardware, making frontier AI model training unaffordable for all but the most well-funded organizations. Most SMEs, particularly those in developing countries, are unlikely to develop new AI models from scratch. Instead, they can adopt and adapt existing AI technologies to meet their particular business needs. Through interactions with numerous users and devices, companies are building up valuable data sets, enabling them to extend their advantages from hardware to data and beyond. This concentration of computing power and services in a few countries has raised concerns about their impacts on the national interests of other countries, particularly because of supply chain vulnerabilities and the interest of Gove",

Investment The United States leads the world in terms of private investment in AI, at $67 billion in 2023, or 70 per cent of global AI private investment. The only developing countries with significant investments were China in the second position, with $7.8 billion, and India in the tenth position, with $1.4 billion. In 2023, the United States also continued to lead in terms of the total number of newly funded AI companies, around seven times the number in the next highest country, China (Maslej et al., 2024).

Knowledge creation Over the period 2000\u20132023, China and the United States were responsible for around one third of global publications in AI and 60 per cent of patents (figure I.14). Apart from China and India, most developing countries have had limited progress, and the distance from developed countries has increased. The situation is similar with regard to GenAI, with most such technologies invented in China and the United States (WIPO, 2024). There is a corresponding gap in AI talent distribution; around half of the world\u2019s top-tier researchers in AI originate from China, followed by 18 per cent from the United States and 12 per cent from Europe (MacroPolo, 2024). The AI-related breakthroughs in recent years could mark the beginning of a new industrial revolution. AI has emerged as a general-purpose technology that can revolutionize processes in various areas powered by highly connected and intelligent production systems that can augment rather than replace humans through improved human\u2013machine interaction. In principle, the use of AI could also help accelerate progress towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. Yet there are risks and ethical concerns arising from the use of biased training data and the invasion of privacy, as well as security threats, cyberattacks or autonomous weapons. If AI is unevenly distributed and lacks ethical oversight and transparency, its use may exacerbate existing inequalities, hindering sustainable human development (Vinuesa et al., 2020). In addition, with high computational demands, AI consumes significant amounts of electricity and water, with significant implications for climate change. This highlights the need for environmentally sustainable and inclusive digitalization strategies (UNCTAD, 2024). Developing countries urgently need to strategically position themselves to harness the benefits of the AI era, while addressing potential risks and promoting equitable and inclusive AI development.

Navigating the report To shape a future in which AI contributes positively to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, a multidimensional and evidence-based approach is required. To that end, this report focuses on the need to build resilient infrastructure and promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and innovation (Goal 9). Concentrated AI development coupled with existing gaps in digital infrastructure risks widening inequalities both within and among countries (Goal 10). The following chapters analyse and provide recommendations on the far-reaching implications of AI, gradually zooming the focus out from its effects on productivity and the workforce to encompass aspects related to global governance (table I.2). Chapter II explores productivity and workforce dynamics from a microeconomic perspective, focusing on economic growth and decent work (Goal 8). Chapters III and IV adopt a national perspective, addressing requirements and policies to support AI adoption, adaptation and development (Goal 9). Chapter V concludes by addressing AI governance from a global perspective, emphasizing the importance of international collaboration, to steer AI towards inclusive and equitable development (Goal 17). 25 Chapter I AI at the technology frontier Annex I Technical note on frontier technologies This annex provides a brief description of the 17 frontier technologies covered in the report. It presents the search queries used in obtaining publication and patent data and the sources of market-size data. Table 1 Frontier technologies covered in the report Artificial intelligence (AI) Generally defined as the capability of a machine to engage in cognitive activities typically performed by the human brain. AI implementations that focus on narrow tasks are widely available and used, for example, in recommending purchases online, for virtual assistants in smartphones and for detecting spam or credit card fraud. New implementations of AI are based on machine learning and harness big data. Internet of things (IoT) The myriad Internet-enabled physical devices that collect and share data. There are many potential applications. Typical fields include wearable devices, smart homes, healthcare, smart cities and industrial automation. Big data Data sets whose size or type is beyond the ability of traditional database structures to capture, manage and process, allowing computers to tap into data that have traditionally been inaccessible or unusable. Blockchain An immutable time-stamped series of data records supervised by a cluster of computers not owned by any single entity. Blockchain serves as the base technology for cryptocurrencies, enabling peer-to-peer transactions that are open, secure and fast. 5G The next generation of mobile Internet connectivity, offering download speeds of around 1 to 10 gigabits per second (4G speeds are around 100 Mbps), as well as more reliable connections on smartphones and other devices. 3D printing 3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, produces three-dimensional objects based on a digital file, and can create complex objects using less material than traditional manufacturing. Robotics Programmable machines that can carry out actions and interact with the environment via sensors and actuators, either autonomously or semi-autonomously. They can take many forms, including disaster response robots, consumer robots, industrial robots, military and/or security robots and autonomous vehicles. Drone technology Also known as Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) or unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). A flying robot that can be remotely controlled or fly autonomously using software with sensors and a global positioning system.",

A flying robot that can be remotely controlled or fly autonomously using software with sensors and a global positioning system. Drones have often been used for military purposes, but also have civilian uses such as in videography, agriculture and delivery services. 26 Solar photovoltaics (Solar PV) The technology transforms sunlight into direct current electricity using semiconductors in photovoltaic cells. In addition to being a renewable energy technology, solar PV can be used in off-grid energy systems, potentially reducing electricity costs and increasing access. Concentrated solar power Concentrated solar power plants use mirrors to concentrate the sun\u2019s rays and produce heat for electricity generation via a conventional thermodynamic cycle. Unlike solar (PV), these plants use only the direct component of sunlight and can provide carbon- free heat and power only in regions with high direct normal irradiance. Biofuels Liquid fuels derived from biomass and used as an alternative to fossil fuel-based liquid transportation fuels such as gasoline, diesel and aviation fuels. Biogas and biomass A mixture of carbon dioxide, methane and small quantities of other gases produced by the anaerobic digestion of organic matter in an oxygen-free environment. Biomass is renewable organic material that comes from trees, other plants and agricultural and urban waste. It can be used for heating, electricity generation and transport fuels. Wind energy The kinetic energy created by air in motion, transformed into electrical energy using wind turbines. Many parts of the world have strong wind speeds, but the best locations for generating wind power are sometimes remote and offshore ones. Green hydrogen Hydrogen generated entirely by renewable energy sources or from low-carbon power. The most fully established technology for producing green hydrogen is water electrolysis fuelled by renewable electricity. Compared with electricity, green hydrogen can be stored more easily. Excess renewable capacity from solar and wind power can be used to power electrolysers that use this energy to create hydrogen, which can be stored as fuel in tanks. Electric vehicles Vehicles that use one or more electric motors for propulsion. They can be powered by a collector system, with electricity from extravehicular sources, or autonomously, by a battery. As energy-consuming technologies, electric vehicles create new demand for electricity that can be supplied by renewable sources. In addition to the benefits of this shift, such as reducing carbon dioxide emissions and air pollution, electric mobility also creates significant efficiency gains and could become an important source of storage for variable sources of renewable electricity. Nanotechnology A field of applied science and technology dealing with the manufacturing of objects in scales smaller than 1 micrometre. Nanotechnology is used to produce a wide range of products such as pharmaceuticals, commercial polymers and protective coatings. It can also be used to design computer chip layouts. Gene editing Also known as genome editing. A genetic engineering tool to insert, delete or modify genomes in organisms. Potential applications include drought-tolerant crops or new antibiotics.

AI can bring productivity gains and increase the income of some workers, but also cause others to lose their jobs, reshaping workplace dynamics and labour demand. Moreover, technological advancements are driving automation, shifting value towards capital. However, the use of AI offers significant potential to augment worker capabilities, potentially reversing this trend and empowering workers, if supported by effective policies and strategic implementation. Through case studies, this chapter illustrates how developing countries can overcome obstacles in AI adoption to reap its benefits. It also highlights the need to place workers at the centre of technological transformation, for the inclusive adoption of AI. Technology and Innovation Report 2025 \u00a9 Gorodenkoff - Shutterstock 35 Chapter II Leveraging AI for productivity and workers\u2019 empowerment The impact of AI on work depends on a complex interplay of automation, augmentation and the creation of new roles. Policymakers should understand these dynamics to ensure the equitable distribution of AI\u2019s benefits and to support smooth workforce transitions. The adoption of AI in developing countries can be accelerated by redesigning AI solutions around locally available infrastructure; utilizing and combining new sources of data; lowering skill barriers for AI with simple interfaces; and building strategic partnerships to access essential resources for AI. Inclusive AI requires a strong emphasis on workers and their professional growth. This includes empowering them with digital literacy, supporting those transiting to new jobs with reskilling training and enhancing overall capabilities through upskilling programmes. Workers should also be involved in the design and implementation of AI tools for an integration into workspaces that addresses their needs and preserves meaningful human roles. Governments should promote human-complementary AI technologies through increased R&D funding, strategic public procurement and targeted tax incentives.",

Workers should also be involved in the design and implementation of AI tools for an integration into workspaces that addresses their needs and preserves meaningful human roles. Governments should promote human-complementary AI technologies through increased R&D funding, strategic public procurement and targeted tax incentives. Improving labour market opportunities and establishing clear career development pathways can mitigate the risk of brain drain. Key policy takeaways 36 A. AI can transform production 1 For example, the electronic payment company Stripe uses GPT-4 to enhance their customer support chatbot. For a legal application of GPT-4, see Co Counsel, a legal research assistant, and for a medical research application, see Insight AI. Previous automation technologies, including the introduction of computers and robotics, and early AI expert systems, relied on predefined conditional logic to guide them step-by-step from input to output. This limited them to routines and structured tasks that could readily be broken down and codified (Autor et al., 2003). AI technologies can go further by using machine learning to identify patterns and relationships from huge amounts of data, improve performance over time and adapt to changing circumstances without explicit reprogramming (Brynjolfsson et al., 2017). The economic significance of this is twofold. First, AI can outperform conventional digital systems and in certain areas surpass human performance (Maslej et al., 2024). Second, unlike previous technological waves that mostly automated routine and low-skill functions, AI can take on tasks that were previously too expensive or difficult to automate, and can be extended to functions that require recognition, classification and prediction that once were thought to be exclusive to highly skilled workers (Brynjolfsson et al., 2017; 2018). In banking, for example, AI systems are being used to predict loan default rates (Turiel and Aste, 2020). In healthcare, AI image classifiers are being used to help doctors in interpreting scans and images, leading to faster and more reliable prognoses (Zhang et al., 2022). AI primarily affects cognitive work, but when combined with other technologies, such as robotics or IoT sensors, it can also control physical production. In manufacturing, AI systems, through a network of smart sensors, can exercise real-time control of energy and water usage, for example (Henry Bristol et al., 2024). In agriculture, AI and machine vision can be paired with robots to automate crop harvesting. The potential of AI applications has been further extended by generative AI (GenAI). In traditional machine learning, each model performs one specialized task, largely reproducing or representing existing knowledge. GenAI can be much more versatile, performing multiple tasks and adapting to the operating context and generating new content. GenAI can write texts, produce images and videos, write computer code and identify complex patterns in data, for knowledge-based services such as finance, education, law and healthcare (Bommasani et al., 2021). For example, GPT-4, the model that powers the chatbot ChatGPT, has been applied as a customer-support agent, a research assistant for lawyers and a medical research assistant for pharmaceutical discovery and development.1 As performance improves and costs decrease, AI can be integrated into many more production processes. In the best cases, this will augment human labour and improve the quality and speed of work. However, there is also the risk that it could replace workers altogether, increasing unemployment, depressing wages and degrading the work experience (Rotman, 2024). If AI is to bring about productive and inclusive economic transformations and reduce inequalities, Governments and companies need to put workers at the centre of AI adoption and development. AI can affect a wide range of tasks, from physical to cognitive 37 Chapter II Leveraging AI for productivity and workers\u2019 empowerment B. Key channels for impacting productivity and the workforce AI can affect human labour and productivity in four main ways (figure II.1), often simultaneously (Acemoglu, 2024b; Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2019), through the following channels: Substitute for human labour \u2013 AI can replace human workers in activities where machines are more efficient, extending the number of tasks in which machines have comparative advantages over humans and thereby displacing labour in favour of capital.",

For example, in the banking sector, instead of transactions being read manually, AI can monitor thousands of transactions simultaneously and detect anomalies and signs of fraud. Complement human labour \u2013 AI can augment human skills, to improve quality, efficiency and productivity, and provide advanced data analysis to support decision- making. In day-to-day business, AI can automate routine tasks such as proofreading documents, scheduling meetings and suggesting replies to emails. This can free up workers for tasks that benefit more from human attention. In medicine, the use of AI can help diagnose cancers and other diseases by analysing electrocardiograms and computed radiography scans and finding abnormalities that might be undetectable by human staff. AI therefore serves as a useful tool that enhances human productivity while freeing workers to employ softer skills. Its use can also affect how people interact with and perceive one another, in both pro-social and anti- social ways (Hohenstein et al., 2023). Figure II.1 Four channels through which AI impacts productivity and the workforce Source: UNCTAD.

For example, in customer service, GenAI chatbots can replace conventional rule-based chatbots, offering more personalized and accurate responses to inquiries, thereby improving a firm\u2019s overall operating efficiency \u2013 total factor productivity \u2013 without undermining the workforce. Create new jobs \u2013 The use of AI can create new jobs, including roles in AI research and development, as well as in its deployment and maintenance. Its use can also create employment in emerging industries related to or created by AI. For example, one study identifies three emerging occupations, namely, AI trainers, who develop and upgrade AI models; AI explainers, who tailor AI models to particular use cases, such as AI-specific user experience designers; and AI sustainers, who monitor and refine AI uses, such as AI ethics experts (Shine, 2023). C. Measuring the impacts To assess the impact of AI on productivity and the workforce, economists generally use two metrics. One focuses on the associated increases in productivity, that is, the amount of goods and services produced for given inputs such as labour and capital. The other considers workforce exposure, that is, the degree to which their tasks can be performed by AI systems; the higher the exposure, the greater the potential for complementation or substitution. Will AI increase productivity? To date, research that employs systematic applied methods on data sets with good coverage and adequate scale is mostly based on micro-level studies on early adopters in developed countries. It is far from conclusive, yet suggests that firms using AI can make substantial productivity gains, particularly those employing skilled workers and those in service industries. A summary of recent firm-level studies indicates that AI can increase both labour productivity and total factor productivity, although the range of the estimates is wide, reflecting the differing capacities of firms to benefit from AI (figure II.2). For example, in some firms in Germany, sales achieved per worker increased substantially with higher levels of AI use (Czarnitzki et al., 2023). In some firms in Italy, total factor productivity increased by 2.2 per cent with the adoption of AI. A study of large firms from a range of countries showed that the accumulated stock of AI knowledge increased total factor productivity by 6.7 per cent (Benassi et al., 2022). The impact may also depend on firm characteristics, such as size, although the evidence is mixed (see annex II). Some studies showed higher productivity gains in larger firms that could benefit from scale effects and greater financial resources (Zhai and Liu, 2023; Yang, 2022). Other studies showed advantages for smaller firms that could integrate new technologies more rapidly within existing production systems (Nucci et al., 2023; Damioli et al., 2021).",

Most of the literature concentrates on developed countries, for which there is more detailed firm-level data. However, similar benefits could also arise in developing countries, as indicated by an analysis of listed firms in China (Zhai and Liu, 2023). The early evidence thus suggests that the use of AI can enhance productivity, yet does not clarify the exact drivers. The use of AI can bring substantial productivity gains 39 Chapter II Leveraging AI for productivity and workers\u2019 empowerment The ambiguities may be clarified once AI has been more widely adopted and there are more firm-level data, particularly from developing countries. Nevertheless, many companies have yet to implement AI on a significant scale, and it may be too early to draw definitive conclusions. A new strand of research has emerged on the impact of GenAI tools, focused on particular tasks performed by workers within firms, to assess the impact of such tools on high-skill\u2013related tasks. 2 Direct comparisons between these and earlier firm-level studies are not possible because higher productivity at the worker or task level does not necessarily translate to the same effect at the firm level. While not directly comparable with studies that consider impacts at the firm level, these studies offer a glimpse of how the new technology may impact the workplace.2 Some studies indicate that GenAI is capable of markedly improving worker performance in a range of tasks (table II.1). For example, at a leading software company, when customer service staff used GenAI chat assistants, there was a 14 per cent increase in the number of issues resolved per hour (Brynjolfsson et al., 2023).

Other studies demonstrate notable productivity enhancements in professional writing and computer coding (Noy and Zhang, 2023). These micro-level studies used experimental or quasi-experimental designs to infer causal links between the use of GenAI tools and gains in labour productivity. They showed significant differences between workers at different skill levels, and it is therefore not clear from the studies whether the use of AI can reduce or increase inequality across workers. For example, one study found that the largest productivity improvements in a customer service centre were from the least-skilled and least-experienced workers, who used an AI assistant to learn the good practices of the highest- skilled workers (Brynjolfsson et al., 2023). On the other hand, another study, on science material researchers, showed much higher productivity gains for leading researchers (Toner-Rodgers, 2024). This may be because the most experienced scientists were able to take advantage of their knowledge to prioritize the most promising AI suggestions, while the 30 per cent of least-productive researchers spent time on testing less promising options. Most of the evidence to date comes from early adopters, and whether similar productivity gains apply to latecomers, particularly from developing countries far from the technological frontier, remains to be ascertained. Overall, the impact of AI, particularly the use of GenAI, tends to be greater for particular service-related tasks. Yet the benefits can also extend indirectly to other firms.",

Overall, the impact of AI, particularly the use of GenAI, tends to be greater for particular service-related tasks. Yet the benefits can also extend indirectly to other firms. Therefore, it is important to foster inter- industry synergies and complementarities between knowledge-based services and manufacturing and the primary sector in order to transmit productivity gains through the economy and drive an AI- powered industrial transformation. More comprehensive studies that consider complex tasks that are more difficult for AI to learn can help better understand the impact of AI across the economy. Nonetheless, the early evidence on GenAI complements the findings from firm- level studies that show that the use of AI can increase productivity (box II.1). GenAI has a significant impact on cognitive and service- related tasks Table II.1 Selected micro-level studies on GenAI productivity impacts Source: UNCTAD, based on cited sources.

The study showed that AI significantly improved worker productivity across three key metrics, namely, reduced handling time per chat, increased chats handled per hour and successful chat resolution rates. Yet these benefits were not uniformly distributed; the most significant improvements were among less-skilled and newer agents while highly skilled and experienced workers showed minimal gains. This finding is particularly significant given the steep learning curve and initial lower productivity often associated with newer hires in the business process outsourcing sector. Interestingly, agents who adhered closely to AI recommendations demonstrated greater productivity gains, suggesting a link between AI engagement and learning. The agents sustained higher productivity even during software outages when AI assistance was unavailable, indicating a lasting impact on skill development. The study also considered the impact of AI on workers. Contact centre work often involves demanding overnight shifts and challenging interactions with customers, but the study showed that, when the workers were supported by AI, customers were impressed, less likely to question their competence and generally treated them better. This helped reduce employee attrition, particularly among newer hires. The researchers attributed these positive effects in part to the ability of the AI system to capture and disseminate best practices from high-performing agents. However, customer satisfaction can also be reduced if using AI makes interactions feel overly scripted and inauthentic. The study concluded that while AI assistance can enhance productivity and improve worker experience, it also creates incentives for firms to deskill positions and hire lower-skilled workers at lower wages. Companies could also eventually deploy even more advanced AI systems capable of entirely replacing human agents. While offering significant potential for companies, the long-term implications for workers remain uncertain and may depend on the strength of workers\u2019 voices in workplace consultations or collective agreements. The findings are corroborated by another study involving 300 call-centre operators that showed that AI that automated repetitive tasks and provided real-time support could reduce stress levels among agents.

Chapter II Leveraging AI for productivity and workers\u2019 empowerment 42 Many more occupations are exposed to AI Previous waves of technology primarily impacted blue-collar occupations, but those most exposed by AI are in knowledge- intensive sectors (Nedelkoska and Quintini, 2018). 3 A recent OECD survey on job markets in Europe and North America listed the top industries prone to AI automation as those in finance, advertising, consulting and information technology (OECD, 2024). Similarly, a study in India based on online job postings between 2016 and 2019 found that AI-related skills requirements were concentrated in information technology, finance and professional services (Copestake et al., 2023). A recent global survey found that GenAI was being adopted least in manufacturing and more commonly in marketing and sales, product and services development and information technology functions (Singla et al., 2024). 3 It should be noted, however, that even in non-knowledge intensive sectors, there are jobs highly exposed to AI (see, for example, Webb, 2020). One study estimated that AI would affect 40 per cent of global employment, showing that one third of jobs in developed countries had high potential for AI automation and around 27 per cent were exposed to AI augmentation (Cazzaniga et al., 2024; figure II.3). Workforces in advanced economies are at greater risk since more of their jobs involve cognitive tasks. However, these economies are also better positioned than emerging and low-income economies to capitalize on the benefits of AI. For individual countries, the impacts depend on their occupational structures. For example, the United Kingdom has a significant share of employment in professional and managerial occupations that are highly exposed to AI augmentation, as well as in clerical support and technician occupations that could be exposed to AI- related automation (Cazzaniga et al., 2024). Developed countries are in general more likely than developing countries to face more immediate labour market adjustments and an increase in wage inequality. Developed countries face greater prospects of AI automation but also greater opportunities for augmentation Figure II.3 Developed countries have greater likelihoods of AI automation but also greater opportunities for augmentation (Employment share exposed to AI, by country grouping; percentage) Source: UNCTAD calculations, based on Cazzaniga et al., 2024 and Gymrek et al., 2024.

Developing countries might, therefore, have time to gain insights from the experiences in developed countries. A similar picture is seen when considering the impact of GenAI. Workers with higher levels of education are more exposed but also more likely to benefit. Overall, GenAI offers greater potential for labour augmentation than automation, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (figure II.3). Technicians and associate professionals can gain from augmentation while clerical support workers are highly exposed to automation. Exposure to GenAI within job categories is relatively balanced from a gender perspective (Gmyrek et al., 2024), but the over-representation of women among clerical support workers makes them more exposed to automation, particularly in the United States and Europe (United Nations and ILO, 2024).",

Exposure to GenAI within job categories is relatively balanced from a gender perspective (Gmyrek et al., 2024), but the over-representation of women among clerical support workers makes them more exposed to automation, particularly in the United States and Europe (United Nations and ILO, 2024). A study in Latin America showed that GenAI was more likely to lead to augmentation than automation and to favour urban, educated and higher-income workers in formal occupations, with the benefits fairly evenly distributed across gender and age (Gmyrek et al., 2024). The study highlighted that nearly half of the occupations that could benefit from augmentation faced digital barriers. In addition, there is a significant gender-related imbalance in automation, largely because women are more likely to perform the most exposed jobs; the proportion of women-held jobs that are exposed to automation can be up to twice that of men. This, combined with the gender divide in digital skills and access to ICTs, can limit the benefits of AI adoption for women, thus widening existing inequalities (UNESCO et al., 2022). It should be emphasized that the impact of AI on the labour market depends on the rate of technology adoption, as well as on other non-technological factors, such as the relative prices of capital and labour, economic structures and the social acceptance of new technology. These factors amplify or reduce expected AI-related impacts between sectors and countries (Brynjolfsson et al., 2017; Cazzaniga et al., 2024; UNCTAD, 2021). GenAI offers greater potential for labour augmentation than automation The use of AI can magnify existing gender disparities \u00a9 Shutterstock 44 Despite concerns about widespread job losses, the pace of automation has been slower than initially predicted (World Economic Forum, 2023a). In one survey conducted in 2020, employers expected that 42 per cent of their business tasks would be automated by 2027 but, subsequently, employers have reduced their estimates. As in previous waves of technological innovation, the use of AI has also created new jobs. One study of seven high-income countries found that while the use of AI had automated some tasks in finance and manufacturing, it had also introduced new tasks, and most employers reported higher productivity but no overall impact on employment (Lane et al., 2023). Box II.2 provides further discussion on the impact of AI in knowledge-intensive sectors. Box II.2 Evidence from knowledge-intensive activities The impact of AI in knowledge-intensive sectors varies by task. One study at a multinational energy firm, for example, found that while algorithms proved beneficial for tasks with clearly defined outcomes, they were less effective in areas requiring creativity, social intelligence or complex decision-making. The study identified two distinct approaches to integrating algorithms. The first was task automation, replacing humans with algorithms on a task-by-task basis, and the second was process re-engineering, redesigning entire workflows around algorithmic solutions. The latter approach is potentially more transformative because it may require new skills in process-mapping, data analysis and software development. Making improvements and benefiting from AI therefore depends on the capacity of firms to adjust workplaces and job tasks. In this way, the use of AI can lead to structural changes; new teams can be dedicated to automation-as-a-service and new forms of hybrid workflows can blur traditional boundaries both within firms and with respect to external agents. The introduction of algorithmic solutions in the firm also changed how knowledge was valued and acquired. Previously, the firm had greater regard for expert judgment, but the introduction of AI focused management more on quantifiable outputs, fostering a culture of metric-driven evaluation. This extended the use of AI beyond algorithmic recommendations, to encompass expert suggestions, leading some workers to question their own expertise. The study also found a shift in learning practices. Faced with complex and often opaque algorithmic recommendations, knowledge workers prioritized the perceived safety and adequacy of these recommendations, even if they did not understand the underlying logic. They thus felt increasingly unfamiliar with their own area of expertise, also known as knowledge self-alienation.

Source: Amaya and Holweg, 2024. 45 Chapter II Leveraging AI for productivity and workers\u2019 empowerment Current evidence suggests that the future scenario is likely to be a complex interplay of automation, augmentation and the emergence of new roles. Automation is likely to reduce the labour share in value added in favour of capital, which will result in slower growth in wages than productivity and increasing wealth concentration. However, this tendency can be counterbalanced by the benefits of augmentation and of generating new tasks for workers (Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2019). It is important to understand and plan for all eventualities. Increasing inequalities have already been stirring social discontent and weakening trust in public institutions, while increasing political polarization and undermining democratic governance (Qureshi, 2023). Policymakers and businesses need to understand these dynamics to ensure that the benefits of AI are distributed equitably and to facilitate smooth transitions. D. Working with uncertainties If the history of past general-purpose technologies is any indication, it could take years or even decades for the full extent of the impacts of AI to materialize (Brynjolfsson et al., 2017). It will take time to acquire a substantial stock of AI technology across a wide range of industries and in firms of different sizes. It will also take time to build complementary assets in AI infrastructure, data and skills. In addition, firms need time to discover new productive uses for AI and integrate them within production activities. The aggregate economic outcome of AI in the long term is thus highly uncertain. In advanced economies, such as Japan and the United States, optimistic projections place long-term annual productivity gains over a 10 to 20-year horizon at between 1 and 2 per cent (Hatzius et al., 2023). With less sectoral exposure to AI, most emerging economies are expected to experience lower levels but still substantial annual growth, at between 0.7 and 1.3 per cent (Hatzius et al., 2023). To put these numbers into perspective, in the past two decades, annual productivity growth in advanced economies has averaged at around 1 per cent and in emerging markets and developing economies, at around 4 per cent (Dieppe, 2021). However, these expectations may be overstated. For instance, one estimate for the United States puts the annual AI- induced productivity boost over the next 10 years at less than 0.1 per cent. This is because AI systems may find it difficult to cope with certain tasks and, while the use of AI may generate new tasks that increase revenue, it may also generate others that are more malign, such as cyberattacks. Moreover, AI may harm consumers through manipulation or addiction. The impact of AI on welfare may be lower than its effect on productivity (Acemoglu, 2024b). To shed light on the conditions needed for the use of AI to generate large and long- term aggregate benefits, three sources of uncertainty should be considered. Uncertainty 1 \u2013 Easy and difficult tasks Part of the disagreement over the long- term aggregate effects of AI originates from uncertainties about the rate of development of the technology and how well and quickly it can be integrated into future economic production. Optimistic observers state that AI will have ever-broadening applications and will spawn adjacent innovations, leading to major productivity improvements (Brynjolfsson et al., 2017). The full impacts of AI could take years to fully materialize Automation shifts value toward capital, but worker- augmenting technologies can reverse this trend 46 Advances in AI-powered machine vision for example, have increased the potential of self-driving cars and of autonomous drones. However, the current rapid success of AI may be misleading, since it has largely been accomplished through easy tasks that can be readily learned. In the near future, AI may be faced with increasingly difficult tasks of a more complex and context-dependent nature that cannot be automated with similar efficiency (Acemoglu, 2024a). In such cases, there may be no straightforward mapping between actions and defined outcomes of success and not enough data to teach machines about hidden relationships (Brynjolfsson and Mitchell, 2017).",

In the near future, AI may be faced with increasingly difficult tasks of a more complex and context-dependent nature that cannot be automated with similar efficiency (Acemoglu, 2024a). In such cases, there may be no straightforward mapping between actions and defined outcomes of success and not enough data to teach machines about hidden relationships (Brynjolfsson and Mitchell, 2017). An example is in the diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric illnesses, which tend to have complex and historical causes that are difficult to capture in data. For such tasks, AI may be no more productive than existing technologies or human workers.4 At the same time, AI is also likely to create new \u201cbad\u201d tasks that can harm overall productivity and well-being (Korinek and Stiglitz, 2021). Examples are deepfakes, misinformation and AI- powered surveillance, which raises social, ethical and privacy-related concerns. It is too early to predict with any degree of confidence how AI systems will transform production in the long term, but it seems that AI technology, as in previous waves of technological innovation, may bring a welcome boost to economic growth, although it may be less impressive than some might have hoped. Moreover, maximizing the positive effects on societies depends on proper guidance and policy measures.5 4 Marcus (2018) identifies further limitations of current deep-learning techniques that prevent AI from becoming general-purpose problem solvers, including the need for significant amounts of training data, the inability to make sense of real-world, abstract ideas that underlie human thinking and the fact that the logic behind their outputs is hard to interpret. Many of these issues are extendable to new GenAI models. 5 This line of argument has been put forward, for example, by Gordon (2014). 6 AI implementors also need to watch out for \u201cso-so\u201d automation technologies, that is AI technologies that cut costs enough to replace workers but not enough to substantially raise productivity (Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2019). Such innovations do little for aggregate productivity and come with the cost of large displacement effects. Chapter IV focuses on national policies, to seize the opportunities brought by AI and chapter V considers AI policies and governance from an international perspective. Uncertainty 2 \u2013 Long-term structural changes in the labour market Productivity gains depend on the long-term structural adjustments in the labour market, as AI can augment or displace labour. If AI is designed and used primarily as a labour- substituting technology, in the long term, the declining employment share in sectors that are more AI intensive can diminish the overall economic effect of productivity gains (Aghion et al., 2017; OECD, 2024). While workers displaced from AI-impacted sectors may be partially absorbed by sectors with lower productivity, this could result in job polarization and widening income inequality (UNCTAD, 2021). Thus, although productivity can increase in AI-intensive sectors, the aggregate productivity impact could be limited by slower productivity growth in labour-intensive sectors. This outcome resembles a scenario of Baumol\u2019s cost disease, in which aggregate productivity growth is defined less by the sectors at the forefront of technological change than by those that are slower to improve (Aghion et al., 2017; OECD, 2024). The actual outcome depends on future interactions between AI adoption and the labour market. If AI acts as a labour- complementing rather than labour-displacing technology in a sufficient number of sectors, it can raise aggregate productivity.6 How far can AI go in substituting humans? AI may bring job polarization and widen income inequality 47 Chapter II Leveraging AI for productivity and workers\u2019 empowerment Another mitigating factor is the extent and nature of job creation. In the past, automation technologies initially caused job losses that were offset in the long term by the appearance of new jobs (Autor, 2015; Bessen, 2019). This reinstatement effect can be strong if AI spawns many complementary industries, particularly in areas in which humans retain a comparative advantage over machines. Yet this could take time. Due to skill mismatches and frictions in the labour market, the transition of workers into these new industries could be slow and costly, and fail to keep pace with rapid changes in AI (UNCTAD, 2021; Bessen et al., 2022; Edin et al., 2023).

Uncertainty 3 \u2013 AI adoption in developing countries The adoption of AI in many developing countries may be hindered by constraints involving the three leverage points of infrastructure, data and skills, creating uncertainty about how these countries can fully exploit the potential of AI. Developing countries have a higher proportion of occupations concentrated in primary and non-knowledge\u2013intensive sectors and, in general, fewer opportunities for AI applications, but large countries can leverage their size and critical mass (see chapter III). More importantly, developing countries may be weaker with regard to critical digital infrastructure and complementary assets such as data and skills. The low level of penetration of reliable electricity and high-speed Internet limits the deployment of AI services, particularly in rural areas. A further impediment is the availability of relevant data. AI models need to be trained on large amounts of high-quality data, but the best data sets are often controlled by global corporations (UNCTAD, 2019). This can significantly hinder the capacity of developing countries to tailor AI systems to local needs. In addition, with regard to skills, in developing countries in particular, only a small portion of the population has general digital literacy or specialized technical know- how, which hinders the adoption of AI. The need for long-term and significant adjustments does not imply that AI is less relevant in developing countries. With careful and targeted implementation, the use of AI can generate immediate and positive changes. However, developing countries need to create the right conditions in order to seize the gains of AI and ensure that they are not left behind. In addition to boosting productivity for workers and firms, the use of AI offers distinct benefits for sustainable development. It can, for example, help decision makers optimize the distribution of scarce resources. Using advanced analytics, they can draw insights from new sources of unstructured data. GenAI systems can also offer support for individuals who would otherwise not have access to specialized knowledge, for instance in education and agriculture (Bj\u00f6rkegren, 2023; Bj\u00f6rkegren and Blumenstock, 2023; Okolo, 2023). To help fill the gap of systematic evidence about AI, section E showcases AI applications in developing countries that can deliver improvements in productivity and human welfare across three key sectors. The case studies also show how limitations in infrastructure, data and skills can be addressed through careful implementation and collaboration among stakeholders, to fit local contexts. Developing countries should create favourable conditions to harness the benefits of AI 48 E. Case studies of AI adoption in developing countries Agriculture Agriculture is the primary source of sustenance for billions of people around the world and, in many developing countries, employs more than half the working population (World Bank, 2024). Agriculture is well suited for AI-powered productivity improvements because of its high volumes of unstructured data, reliance on labour and complex supply chain logistics, as well as the significant number of farmers who would value customized services that are not locally available. Rural agricultural areas are typically short of the prerequisites for AI adoption (e.g. electricity, Internet access and digital literacy). Despite these challenges, the following case studies demonstrate how AI can be used in three main agricultural applications in developing countries, with significant impacts on the yield and quality of crops, as well as the livelihoods of farmers (table II.2). Pest and disease control Globally each year, pests and diseases decimate up to 40 per cent of the world\u2019s crops, causing substantial detriment to farmers (FAO, 2024a). Effectively addressing such problems requires specialist knowledge; it can take years of experience to diagnose infestations in a timely fashion and apply appropriate treatments. Such expertise is generally in short supply, particularly in areas in which smallholding farmers do not receive agricultural extension services. With the use of AI, however, expert information can be made instantly available to any farmer who has a mobile telephone.",

With the use of AI, however, expert information can be made instantly available to any farmer who has a mobile telephone. In Colombia, the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture, for example, has developed a mobile application that helps farmers diagnose infestations of banana plants using photos of crops, called Tumaini, which means \u201chope\u201d in Swahili (Salian, 2019). AI could serve as an accessible source of expert information Table II.2 Case studies of AI applications in agriculture Source: UNCTAD.

A farmer uploads a photo of the plant and the application provides an instant diagnosis and suggests dedicated countermeasures. Tumaini can detect five diseases and one pest with an accuracy of above 90 per cent, giving farmers a diagnostic capacity comparable to that of highly trained experts (Selvaraj et al., 2019). The application is also available in offline mode, although there may be some loss of accuracy, and can therefore be widely used even in rural areas that lack reliable Internet access. To date, Tumaini has been downloaded over 10,000 times in 15 countries across Africa, Latin America and South-East Asia (Tumaini, 2024). Crop diseases in developing countries can also be addressed with the use of GenAI-powered chatbots. MkulimaGPT, for example, created for farmers in the United Republic of Tanzania, is a large language model that has an elaborate sensor-based disease- detection system for maize (Math Works News and Stories, 2024). The chatbot is delivered through a commonly used mobile messaging app, to facilitate diffusion among local farmers. A farmer uploads a photo of the crop, which is cross-referenced with an internal database and, if the application detects an abnormality, it initiates a chat session, offers a diagnosis and guides the user through the appropriate action, thereby significantly lowering the skill barrier for the average maize farmer (Mkulimagpt, 2024). One limitation of deploying large language models in developing countries is a lack of training data in local languages. To address this with regard to MkulimaGPT, the developers have obtained funding from a private charitable foundation, to collect high-quality local data and build a chatbot that speaks Swahili, to ensure that the chatbot is tailored to local needs. The Tumaini diagnostic application Source: Tumaini, 2024. Diagnosing a suspected infection on banana 50 Yield prediction Another common application of AI in agriculture is in predicting local crop yields in order to allow farmers to make informed financial and management decisions about their crops. Such use also offers Governments accurate data needed in monitoring and ensuring food security. Conventional data collection methods for crop yields, such as field surveys and aerial imagery, are costly and difficult to scale. In addition, traditional statistical methods struggle to capture the many complex factors that contribute to yields, such as climate and soil conditions and crop genotypes. The ability of AI technology to jointly analyse different data from unconventional data sources can help unlock new opportunities.

The ability of AI technology to jointly analyse different data from unconventional data sources can help unlock new opportunities. Drawing upon and analysing free open- source data, AI can generate reliable crop yield predictions. Researchers at Beijing Normal University, for example, have used AI techniques with three open-source data sets to estimate the yield of rice crops (Cao et al., 2021). Their model relies on climate and soil data from Google Earth Engine, historical crop yield data from official publications and open-access satellite imagery, all of which are readily accessible on the Internet; open-source data can thus help fill gaps when local data are sparse. Once models have been calibrated and key information pre-processed, AI can offer an accessible and effective solution. Compared with traditional regression models, the deep neural network proved more efficient in extracting crop-yield\u2013related features from the data, with up to 88 per cent accuracy compared with only 42 per cent when using traditional regression models. When used with data from China, the new model enabled accurate predictions of rice yields at the county level, covering 94 per cent of the rice cultivation area (Cao et al., 2021). This case study shows that the use of AI can open new ways to use data for accurate crop-yield prediction in low-resource conditions. In addition, in China, researchers from the South China Agriculture University have applied machine-learning techniques to images from unmanned aerial vehicles, to predict yields of cotton (Xu et al., 2021). Compared with satellite imagery, imagery from such vehicles offers higher resolutions and can thus facilitate yield predictions at a much more granular level, even individual fields. As in the previous study, the deep- learning model achieved significantly higher accuracy than one based on linear regression, namely, 80 per cent compared with 66 per cent. Such a model may be particularly helpful for smallholding farming communities that need to plan harvests and choose which crops or activities to invest in. Precision irrigation One of the most important resources for agriculture is water, which is often scarce. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), 1.2 billion people live in agricultural areas with very high levels of water stress, mostly in developing countries (FAO, 2020). In recent years, the problem has been exacerbated by climate change, with the increasing intensity and frequency of droughts (World Bank, 2023). These impacts can be alleviated by a combination of AI and other technologies. In Tunisia, for example, there have been regular severe droughts, the impacts of which are aggravated by intense agricultural production (Frost, 2024). Agriculture accounts for over 70 per cent of the country\u2019s freshwater withdrawal; it is therefore both the main cause and a casualty of water shortages (FAO, 2024b). The issue is being addressed, for example, by ifarming, a startup founded in Tunisia in 2017 to reduce water consumption through more accurate farming. The main service of the startup is Phyt\u2019Eau, an AI- based programme that can analyse data on water use collected in real time through an array of IoT sensors on farms (Agritech, 2024). The sensors collect information that measures water stress on crops, including AI-managed agricultural systems help optimize production processes AI can leverage new data sources to provide reliable yield prediction 51 Chapter II Leveraging AI for productivity and workers\u2019 empowerment on temperature, soil humidity and wind. Based on the data, Phyt\u2019Eau prescribes an optimal irrigation management plan for the plot that, when connected to an irrigation system, can be administered automatically. In initial trials, the prototype reduced water use by 20 per cent and increased crop production by 20 per cent (Galtier, 2017). IBM offered access to advanced AI and IoT platforms, and this collaboration boosted the water-saving capability of Phyt\u2019Eau to 40 per cent and productivity by up to 30 per cent (IBM, 2024). AI is also used in precision agriculture in Malaysia, for example, where drones equipped with AI vision systems are being deployed in palm-oil plantations to spray nutrients and pesticides with speed and precision (Chu, 2022). In Fiji and Samoa, an AI-based system developed in Australia is being used for automatic weeding and pesticide spraying (ITU, 2024).",

These and other projects are leveraging AI with other automation technologies to achieve more sustainable and productive farming. 7 Industry 4.0, also known as the fourth industrial revolution, comprises the transformation of traditional manufacturing and industrial practices using the latest smart technology. It involves collecting systems, data and real-time analytics to achieve smarter and more efficient production. Manufacturing Manufacturing plays a key role in economic development, stimulating growth in different upstream and downstream sectors and generating significant employment opportunities (Haraguchi et al., 2017; Lautier, 2024). Examples from developing countries such as Brazil, China and India show how industrialization can reduce poverty and accelerate economic growth. Manufacturing has been subject to successive waves of technological innovation, the latest of which is Industry 4.0 technologies.7 Developing countries that have applied these technologies have boosted productivity and growth rates in manufacturing value added and GDP (UNIDO, 2019). The following case studies show how developing countries can use AI to cut costs, create better working environments and increase efficiency (table II.3). AI-powered robots can revolutionize production processes Table II.3 Case studies of AI applications in manufacturing Source: UNCTAD.

Over recent decades, industrial robots have automated many repetitive processes and replaced human workers in hazardous and physically demanding environments (Wang et al., 2023). One disadvantage is that they can be fairly rigid, generally built and programmed for particular tasks, and it is costly to adapt them to new tasks. The use of AI enables robots to be more versatile and adaptive. In China, for instance, a technology company has developed a fully automated AI-driven robot for welding (Doubao, 2019). Its deep-learning algorithm uses three-dimensional laser sensors to recognize objects in real time and distinguish between various metal parts and weld joints and it can guide the robotic arm to perform accurate welding operations. An advantage of the technology is that it can weld on shiny metal surfaces, whereas previous robots could not make the necessary distinctions due to reflections. 8 In Indonesia, for example, see https://www.universal-robots.com/case-stories/pt-jvc-electronics-indonesia/. More importantly, while traditional welding robots need to be reprogrammed for each new product, an AI-powered welding robot can quickly adapt to different functions and the new dimensions of incoming parts while requiring minimal human intervention. This can significantly reduce retraining costs and shorten downtimes. Within the field of AI-guided industrial robots, an emerging trend is the use of collaborative robots, or cobots. These are unlike ordinary robots in that they are designed to work in close interaction with humans. Typically, they are smaller and less expensive and have built-in mechanisms that reduce the need for additional safety fencing. Due to these features, cobots can be more readily integrated into small-scale production lines or labour-intensive manufacturing settings.8 AI enhances the collaborative qualities of cobots by improving safety and by enabling them to work in more dynamic environments (Mohammadi Amin et al., 2020).

Breakdowns cause delays in production and require expensive replacements of parts. They are particularly burdensome for manufacturers in developing countries where skilled technicians and stocks of specialized spare parts may be in short supply. Many of these problems can be prevented by using AI for predictive maintenance. In traditional machine maintenance, technicians carry out inspections and repairs manually, either when scheduled, or when a machine breaks down. In predictive maintenance, machinery is constantly monitored for signs of failure using IoT sensors, with data analysed by AI processors. By cross-referencing with past data, an AI processor detects patterns indicative of a future malfunction and alerts plant operators ahead of time. In T\u00fcrkiye, for example, Vestel Electronics, a home appliances manufacturer, has collaborated with a university to apply machine learning to predict the remaining useful life \u2013 the expected amount of time until a machine\u2019s next breakdown \u2013 of plastic injection moulding machines. The algorithm is trained on historical sensor data, including the clamping force of a machine, oil temperature and injection time, then analyses real-time sensor data in the factory. According to a study by the company, the algorithm correctly predicted the remaining useful life of the machines 98 per cent of the time (Aslanta\u015f et al., 2022). Equipped with this information, managers can schedule maintenance and purchase spare parts in advance, thereby lowering costs and downtimes. Predictive maintenance only requires AI data processors and a set of IoT sensors attached to machines. It is thus versatile and adaptable to different industrial environments. In Chile, for example, large mining companies such as Codelco are using the technology to monitor the fleet of autonomous mining trucks (Jamasmie, 2019). Smaller manufacturers can also use the technology given the increasing availability of less- expensive, standardized packages. Smart factories In large-scale manufacturing, multiple AI-enabled systems can be integrated within a single plant, to provide significant gains in production, savings in energy and greater profits. The synergistic effects of AI and other frontier technologies may also enable manufacturers in developing countries to catch up with counterparts in developed countries. In India, Tata Steel, one of the country\u2019s largest steel manufacturers, has implemented more than 250 machine- learning systems across various production processes (Harichandan, 2023). One such application assesses the quality of welds on steel tubes. A machine-learning algorithm can automatically detect a faulty weld with more than 80 per cent accuracy and thereby significantly lower the number of defective products (Gujre and Anand, 2020). The use of AI can also help optimize the chemical mix in steel furnaces and speed up the transportation of materials within and between plants. Such improvements, combined with other digital technology upgrades, have increased the corporation\u2019s pre-tax profits (Das, 2021). Another example is Unilever, who has built the world\u2019s largest laundry detergent powder factory in Indaiatuba, a municipality in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. The company has made the factory more agile and cost efficient while minimizing its environmental footprint by using technologies such as AI and digital twins, that is, virtual representations of physical objects. AI enables efficient preventive maintenance Systematic integration of AI with other technologies can accelerate industrialization 54 A digital twin is used with machine learning to establish the optimal process parameters for new formulations of laundry powder. Reducing the need for physical trials has accelerated the launch of innovations while cutting energy consumption (Unilever, 2023). Between 2018 and 2023, the company also used AI-driven predictive maintenance to halve the cost of life cycle management for pneumatic devices.",

Between 2018 and 2023, the company also used AI-driven predictive maintenance to halve the cost of life cycle management for pneumatic devices. Other key use cases include a biomass- powered machine-learning spray-drying tower that has achieved a 96 per cent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions and a digitally enabled sealing solution that has eliminated chronic defects, reducing customer complaints about leakage by 94 per cent. As a result, the technologies have reduced innovation lead times by 33 per cent and production costs per ton by 23 per cent, while also reducing carbon dioxide emissions. In 2022, in recognition of its achievements in the field of advanced manufacturing, the Indaiatuba site was listed by the World Economic Forum as one of the 29 new \u201clighthouse\u201d factories worldwide (World Economic Forum, 2023b). Healthcare The use of AI offers significant opportunities for improving access to and the quality of healthcare services in both developed and developing countries. Many developing regions lack medical services and infrastructure, which challenges citizen well-being and poverty reduction goals. With regard to healthcare services, the use of AI can improve both access and quality. The following case studies illustrate how AI has been implemented in developing countries to provide expert diagnoses of diseases, extend the coverage of healthcare services and manage pandemic outbreaks (table II.4). Improving diagnoses The timely and accurate treatment of diseases requires high-quality diagnostics, which are often unavailable to patients in developing countries, particularly in rural areas, due to a lack of skilled medical professionals, laboratory facilities and infrastructure. AI offers the prospect of new and cost-effective diagnostic methods and equipment in low-resource settings. Table II.4 Case studies of AI applications in healthcare Source: UNCTAD. Application Case study Technology Outcomes Improving diagnoses Ubenwa (university startup, Nigeria) AI (deep learning) Accessible tool for quick and accurate perinatal asphyxia diagnosis AI-assisted portable X-ray machine (United Nations Development Programme and local health authorities, South Sudan and Tajikistan) AI Reliable tuberculosis diagnosis in remote and resource-constrained areas Extending healthcare coverage mMitra (non-profit organization, India) AI Targeted intervention for women with high dropout risk from programme mDaktari (healthcare company, Kenya, in collaboration with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation) GenAI (large language model) Preliminary clinical screening tool for low-resource areas Assisting pandemic management and control Refugee population modelling at the border of Brazil and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and Government of Brazil) AI Accurate prediction of refugee inflows, for resource allocation in pandemic conditions 55 Chapter II Leveraging AI for productivity and workers\u2019 empowerment AI can, for example, be used to diagnose perinatal asphyxia, a birth complication that leaves infants unable to breathe properly and, in developing countries, is one of the top three causes of newborn deaths (WHO, 2024). Most cases can be treated if quickly diagnosed; in developed countries, this is commonly done by sending a sample of an infant\u2019s blood to a laboratory, for analysis of signs of low blood oxygen, a service that may be out of reach in rural areas. In Nigeria, a team of AI researchers has offered a novel, simple and inexpensive alternative involving analysing an infant\u2019s cries. Crying and breathing rely on the same set of muscles, and irregular vocal sounds in an infant\u2019s cry are a reliable indicator of asphyxia. Such minute differences may not be heard by human ears, but can be readily detected by a machine-learning algorithm trained on a data set of infant cries. The researchers developed Ubenwa \u2013 meaning \u201ccry of a baby\u201d in Igbo \u2013 an AI-driven mobile application that analyses a short audio clip of a newborn\u2019s cry and can detect perinatal asphyxia with an accuracy of 86 per cent, securing valuable time for treatment (Onu et al., 2019). Another example of an AI system that can enhance traditional diagnostics is a battery- powered X-ray machine with an embedded AI-driven tuberculosis screener. In countries with few expert radiologists, this can serve as a valuable tool for doctors.",

Another example of an AI system that can enhance traditional diagnostics is a battery- powered X-ray machine with an embedded AI-driven tuberculosis screener. In countries with few expert radiologists, this can serve as a valuable tool for doctors. Unlike traditional X-ray machines, the battery- powered machines are portable and can be deployed in remote areas that may have limited electricity connections. For example, such machines are being used by health authorities in South Sudan and Tajikistan, with support from the United Nations Development Programme. In Tajikistan, 15 machines have already been used to screen 120,000 people in 2023, covering 15 per cent of the country\u2019s total diagnosed cases of tuberculosis (UNDP, 2024). Extending healthcare coverage A common problem among developing countries is the inadequate coverage of medical services. The World Health Organization recommends at least 45 skilled medical professionals for every 10,000 people. In many developing countries, this figure is not reached, making it difficult to extend life-saving resources. It takes time for countries to build up their healthcare systems, but the use of AI can help allocate existing resources to those in greatest need (WHO, 2016). AI offers new and cost- effective diagnostic methods An AI-enhanced X-ray machine being deployed in Rudaki, Tajikistan Source: UNDP. 56 Around 800 women died from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth every day in 2020 (WHO, 2025). These could be avoided with better health information and access to medical care during pregnancy. Armman, a non-profit organization, helps provide maternal and child health services in urban slums using mMitra, a free mobile messaging service (Armaan, 2024). The service covers 3.6 million vulnerable women in India, sending curated voice messages about preventative care measures during different stages of pregnancy, to raise medical awareness and promote the health of both mothers and infants. Studies show that enrolment in the service enhances women\u2019s maternal knowledge, enhances their voice within their families regarding their pregnancies and increases their likelihood of seeking professional medical services (Murthy et al., 2019; Murthy et al., 2020). However, about 40 per cent of enrolled women eventually stop listening to the messages and drop out. Due to limited resources, Armman staff cannot reach out to re-engage all of them, but are collaborating with Google India on an AI model that helps find and target the pregnant mothers at greatest risk of dropping out (Taneja and Tambe, 2022; Mate et al., 2021). The model analyses each woman\u2019s socioeconomic information, such as family size, income and age, as well as their call history, including call duration and missed calls, to predict those at highest risk of discontinuing and, of these, who would benefit most from the outreach service. Armman staff then allocate limited human resources more effectively and attempt to keep more women in the programme. After the introduction of the AI algorithm, engagement by subscribers rose by 30 per cent (Mate et al., 2021). This type of personalized messaging could be used in other sectors besides healthcare and help optimize the distribution of limited resources. There is also limited healthcare outreach in Kenya; for every 10,000 people, there are only 23 available medical doctors (Our World in Data, 2024). Access Afya, a social enterprise, operates 12 small clinics using a telemedicine platform, mDaktari, that provides low- cost virtual doctor consultations (Philips Foundation Team, 2023). Using GenAI, the enterprise aims to reach more people. In a pilot programme, ChatGPT is integrated with mDaktari, to provide a chatbot that can be used as a preliminary screening tool (The Economist, 2024). The chatbot receives patients\u2019 inquiries, gathers information about symptoms and suggests that the patient should visit a clinic or collect medication at a pharmacy. This service saves clinics time on gathering patient information and, when appropriate, diverts individuals with mild conditions from the use of clinical services. AI chatbots are not foolproof; they cannot tell what is real and what is fake and can be prone to fabrications (Alkaissi and McFarlane, 2023). Access Afya addresses the fallibility of chatbots by ensuring that human clinicians review and approve chatbot suggestions before they are sent to patients, in order to protect against mistakes.",

Access Afya addresses the fallibility of chatbots by ensuring that human clinicians review and approve chatbot suggestions before they are sent to patients, in order to protect against mistakes. Use of the triage performed by AI allows human clinicians to focus on those patients in greatest need. The early success of the programme shows the potential of using GenAI as an effective triage tool, to improve efficiency and extend the reach of existing medical services. With financial support from a private charitable foundation, Access Afya plans to expand the service to accommodate multiple languages and have a greater role in supporting clinician diagnoses (Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, 2024). Pandemic management and control As shown during the COVID-19 pandemic, managing outbreaks of infectious diseases requires providing public health administrators with accurate and up- to-date information, for example, about demographic movements, transmission patterns and healthcare capacity. AI can help expand healthcare coverage despite limited resources 57 Chapter II Leveraging AI for productivity and workers\u2019 empowerment Equipped with such information, authorities may be better able to target interventions and bring an outbreak under control. In developing countries, structured healthcare data are often not available, particularly with regard to minority and vulnerable populations. As an alternative, the use of AI can unlock the potential of significant amounts of unstructured data. In Brazil, for example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2021, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) worked with the Government on a machine-learning tool for predicting the inflow of refugees from the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and for coordinating resources to protect them from the coronavirus (Smith, 2021). The tool was used to predict future border crossings based on historical patterns. Since the pandemic had disrupted data collection, researchers used unconventional open-source data. These included Internet search activity on migration and border-related topics, complemented by data on COVID-19 cases and news reports on local unrest in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (de Rubalcava et al., 2023). Sources also included bus timetables in border regions and schedules for salary payments, as an indicator of when people might have additional funds for travel. By triangulating between these sources of data, the AI model predicted the inflow of refugees one month in advance with a high degree of confidence. This helped UNHCR and local partners plan for the number of migrants that arrived when borders reopened in June 2021 (UNHCR, 2022). By combining and analysing significant and different data sets, AI can help inform key decisions during infectious outbreaks, using population movement models, such as in Brazil, or algorithms that forecast disease transmission (Jin et al., 2022) or enable rapid diagnosis and contact tracing (Huang et al., 2021). F. Good practices and lessons learned The case studies considered are often limited in scale or in the pilot stage, but serve to illustrate the potential of AI in developing countries and how difficulties can be overcome through careful implementation and cooperation among stakeholders. There are no one-size-fits-all solutions, but a good starting point in each country is to assess local conditions and technological capacities and adopt AI strategically. This may mean, for example, supporting startups and industry\u2013university collaborations, as well as non-profit organizations that help deploy AI solutions to serve local needs. Governments should favour the emergence of AI ecosystems with investments supporting business development and networking. By showcasing successful experiences of AI adoption, they can raise awareness and diffusion and favour the accumulation of complementary assets and experience. It is also useful to engage with large companies or international organizations that can support promising local businesses with emerging technologies and connect them with international markets. This allows developing countries to accumulate relevant complementary assets and experience for the extensive and impactful diffusion of AI.",

It is also useful to engage with large companies or international organizations that can support promising local businesses with emerging technologies and connect them with international markets. This allows developing countries to accumulate relevant complementary assets and experience for the extensive and impactful diffusion of AI. There are four main takeaways from the case studies along the key leverage points of infrastructure, data and skills, as well as partnerships (figure II.4). AI data analytics can enhance decision- making 58 Takeaway 1: Adapting to local digital infrastructure AI adoption should be designed according to the available digital infrastructure. In Colombia, for example, the banana disease detection application Tumaini has an offline mode that retains most of the diagnostic functions in the absence of an Internet connection, thereby remaining accessible and useful to farmers in rural areas where Internet connectivity is limited. Similarly, AI adoption should take into account unstable supplies of electricity. The AI-assisted X-ray machines in South Sudan and Tajikistan, for example, operate on battery power and can therefore reach remote areas. Other case studies highlight different uses of AI applications based on mobile telephones, which offer a scalable platform for AI applications. Takeaway 2: Utilizing new sources of data AI depends on high-quality, relevant and interoperable data sets. In developing countries, such data sets may be limited, difficult to access or expensive to pay for, and innovative ways of collecting and using new forms of data are therefore key in ensuring AI capabilities and effective adoption. In Brazil, for example, in modelling refugee flows at the border during the COVID-19 pandemic, UNHCR researchers relied on an unconventional nowcast data set, which included indicators scraped from local sources, then integrated, to produce accurate predictions of refugee movements. Alternative data sources become viable and help overcome data limitations if the right AI techniques are applied. As shown by the case studies, in China, for example, deep neural network techniques enabled the use of open-access data in rice yield predictions and, in Nigeria, the Ubenwa application used deep-learning algorithms to employ anomalies in infant cries as a reliable indicator of a health complication after birth. Takeaway 3: Making AI easy to use One of the main impediments to technology adoption in developing countries is a low level of digital literacy. Governments need to build greater digital capacity. In addition, designers need to consider current standards of digital capacity and build applications that are attractive and simple to use, particularly on mobile telephones. Simple interfaces help facilitate interactions by novice users with new technology solutions and thereby help promote widespread and inclusive diffusion. Figure II.4 Four takeaways for promoting AI adoption in developing countries Source: UNCTAD. Infrastructure Data Skills Partnerships Redesign AI solutions around locally available digital infrastructure Utilize new sources of data combined with appropriate AI techniques Lower the skill barriers for AI solutions with simple interfaces Build international partnerships to access vital resources and technical capabilities 59 Chapter II Leveraging AI for productivity and workers\u2019 empowerment For example, in the United Republic of Tanzania, a chatbot for maize diseases allows users to access diagnostic information and make queries in a manner similar to messaging family or friends. Application-based AI tools and visual aids such as icons and illustrations allow for an intuitive understanding of available functions. Such designs smooth the experience for those who may be unfamiliar with new technology and are critical in AI adoption in developing countries. Takeaway 4: Building strategic partnerships Developing countries aiming to accelerate the adoption of AI can benefit from strategic partnerships. A cross-country study by the World Bank showed that firms in developing countries that adopted more sophisticated technologies tended to be those with more external collaborations, through universities, foreign trade partners or large multinational corporations (Cirera et al., 2022). Building strategic partnerships enables aspiring AI adopters to overcome barriers to adoption. In addition, Governments can overcome limitations of size through regional collaboration.",

For example, in many countries in East Africa, Swahili is a common language; a group of countries could collaborate to pool data in Swahili and jointly engage with technology companies to address common linguistic challenges. Strategic partnerships can also provide essential resources for AI. Global Grand Challenges, under the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, for example, currently supports the development of AI models in local languages. The AI model for predicting the risk of dropping out among subscribers of a service provided by Armman was developed with technical assistance from Google India.

Workers throughout the AI life cycle A growing body of research shows the crucial yet frequently forgotten role of human labour in AI. Each stage of an AI product life cycle, from development and production to maintenance, relies on human labour, often through digital platforms and business process outsourcing companies dispersed around the world (Rani and Dhir, 2024; Viana Braz et al., 2023; Tubaro and Casilli, 2019). An AI life cycle requires human labour at three stages, namely, data preparation, modelling and evaluation (figure II.5). Data preparation and AI evaluation may require different levels of content-specific expertise, while modelling generally requires higher competences in computer science. The initial stage, data preparation, involves data collection and annotation. Despite the increase of unsupervised learning from unstructured data, AI systems rely on annotation by humans to label and mark data in order to add meaning (Tubaro et al., 2020). Computer vision models, for example, rely on semantic segmentation, a time-consuming process requiring each pixel in an image to be assigned a relevant label. Similarly, autonomous vehicles rely on databases of images annotated by humans through classification, object tagging and landmark detection (Wang et al., 2023; Schmidt et al., 2019). Human labour is essential throughout the AI life cycle Figure II.5 A simplified AI life cycle Source: UNCTAD. Data preparation Data generation Data annotation Modelling AI evaluation Model design Model training Deployment Output and checking 61 Chapter II Leveraging AI for productivity and workers\u2019 empowerment One source of such annotation is the use of a captcha [Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart] (Agarwal, 2023). While some aspects of data preparation can be automated, many tasks still require human judgment. For ChatGPT, for example, the initial model training involved human trainers who engaged in conversations, posing as both users and AI assistants. To optimize its performance, the model\u2019s parameters and settings often need to be adjusted by machine-learning experts. Creating training data for specialized fields such as translation or transcription requires workers with high levels of skill (Kenny, 2022). Medical systems require professionally trained workers to label and tag images and videos; common annotation tasks include the pixel-level segmentation of surgical images, bounding box annotations around organs and the plotting of characteristics within data. Such tasks can be time-consuming; an hour of video footage may require approximately 800 hours of human annotation. The second stage, modelling, is more complex and technical and requires significant human expertise and decision- making. Developers and data scientists need to select the appropriate model architecture and algorithms and therefore require an understanding of the advantages and limitations of different models and algorithms, as well as expertise in a particular domain, such as medicine or transportation. During the model training, when an AI model learns patterns from data, human operators manage, optimize and guide the process.",

During the model training, when an AI model learns patterns from data, human operators manage, optimize and guide the process. Engineers, for example, need to troubleshoot model errors or issues, check for signs of overfitting or underfitting9 and adjust the model\u2019s hyperparameters. 9 Overfitting and underfitting are common problems in statistics and machine learning. Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex, fitting the training data too closely and failing to generalize well to new data. Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple, leading to poor performance. 10 One study showed that human judgment remains crucial, since \u201calgorithms cannot always tell the difference between terrorist propaganda and human rights footage or hate speech and provocative comedy\u201d (Google, 2023). In the final stage, evaluation, humans need to review the outputs in order to maintain quality control and feed information back into further model training. With regard to translation, for example, human experts assess the accuracy of machine translations and diagnose errors, providing feedback for improvement (Kenny, 2022). This interplay between humans and machines extends to large language models such as ChatGPT. Humans are needed to evaluate performance both qualitatively and quantitatively and to ensure a model meets quality standards and avoids biases related to gender, race, religion or other attributes.10 Human labellers rank model answers from best to worst, a process known as reinforcement learning from human feedback, which helps align systems with human values and preferences and to more closely match complex metrics of human quality (Teubner et al., 2023). AI systems require continuous adaptation and, as they are employed to address new challenges, the demand for workers for their development will likely persist. AI systems can thus provide new forms of employment, but this is not necessarily \u201cdecent\u201d work. In the data preparation stage, for example, employment can involve exploitative, often-precarious working conditions. Data annotators in developing countries often experience difficult conditions, including up to 10 hours of work per day at wages of less than $2 per hour, engaged in repetitive tasks, and with limited opportunities for career advancement, for example in Kenya and Uganda (ILO, 2024a; Muldoon et al., 2024). With regard to content moderation (e.g. of social media posts), algorithms or machine-learning systems can help flag data for human attention. This process may be harmful for workers. Human input is key in evaluating and improving AI models 62 That is, in monitoring content online, workers may be exposed to disturbing or objectionable material that could negatively affect mental health (Ahmed et al., 2023). There is also a risk of deskilling and dissatisfaction due to mismatches between qualifications and tasks. Workers annotating or deleting images, that is, carrying out repetitive low-skill tasks, may be highly educated. In India and Kenya, for example, a survey conducted in 2022 on microtask platforms and business process outsourcing companies showed that highly educated workers, with graduate degrees or specialized educations in science, technology, engineering or mathematics, were often relegated to relatively low-skill tasks such as text and image annotation and content moderation. Such significant wastes of human capital may be exacerbated in increasingly connected job markets, in which tasks are outsourced globally (ILO, 2024a; 2024b). H. A worker-centric approach to AI Achieving more inclusive and equitable technological development requires placing greater emphasis on workers and their professional growth. This involves broadening the focus of traditional goals of maximizing productivity and efficiency, to foster skill development and empower workers to adapt to and thrive in a rapidly evolving technological landscape. Increased automation in recent decades has contributed to higher productivity and lower prices, but the distribution of benefits has been largely in favour of capital. A worker-centric approach can contribute to an economic model that is socially and politically sustainable. Translating technological progress into shared prosperity requires labour-friendly policies in three stages: investments in education and skills, in pre-production; labour protection and worker empowerment, in production",

Increased automation in recent decades has contributed to higher productivity and lower prices, but the distribution of benefits has been largely in favour of capital. A worker-centric approach can contribute to an economic model that is socially and politically sustainable. Translating technological progress into shared prosperity requires labour-friendly policies in three stages: investments in education and skills, in pre-production; labour protection and worker empowerment, in production; and progressive taxation, in post-production. For example, such policies were implemented in the United States and Western Europe during the technological transitions in the early twentieth century and in the post-World War II era (Acemoglu and Johnson, 2023). A basic step is to empower the workforce with digital literacy, reinforced through all stages of education and lifelong training systems that incorporate digital skills in curricula and are tailored to different occupations, to prepare for possible future transformations. Technological advances continually perpetuate and amplify inequalities, and it is important to directly target inequality that arises during production (Rodrik and Stantcheva, 2021). With regard to jobs that are highly exposed to AI automation, Governments need to help workers transitioning to new occupations and tasks, through reskilling training and tailored social protection measures, for a smooth transition process. Workers whose jobs are subject to AI augmentation can also benefit from upskilling programmes to acquire new complementary competences, in order to make use of the latest technologies, and enhance their roles to include high-value tasks (United Nations and ILO, 2024). To build trust and acceptance, workers should be actively involved in the design and implementation of AI tools. Job workflows and tasks should be rearranged to integrate AI effectively while addressing workers\u2019 needs and maintaining meaningful human roles. A mismatch between qualifications and tasks could result in the deskilling of highly educated workers Translating technological progress into shared prosperity requires labour- friendly policies 63 Chapter II Leveraging AI for productivity and workers\u2019 empowerment Inclusive AI requires putting workers at the centre of technological development Collaborative AI systems should empower rather than replace workers, foster job satisfaction and create opportunities for personal and professional growth. Labour unions and worker representatives can play a key role in shaping such collaboration. During previous industrial revolutions, for example, unions helped set wages, working hours and safety standards. Similarly, they can provide a voice to workers worldwide, to direct AI towards a worker- centric transformation with a more equitable distribution of productivity gains between firms and workers (Oxfam International, 2024). Global union federations, such as UNI Global Union, are active in safeguarding workers\u2019 interests and human rights in the age of AI. For example, UNI Global Union has issued top 10 principles for ethical AI and negotiated over 50 global agreements with companies, to secure and enforce the rights of workers (UNI Global Union, 2017). Setting a course for AI systems that enhance and complement human skills also depends on robust public policy. This should include increased R&D funding, strategic public procurement and targeted tax incentives for human-complementary AI technologies. Some countries have lower taxes for capital than for labour, thus encouraging technology for automation rather than for labour augmentation (Acemoglu et al., 2020). Consideration should be given to whether and how existing measures, such as tax rates, tax credits or deductions and accelerated depreciation, might incentivize technology and business development that is more labour-friendly and guide enterprises towards human-complementary AI technologies (Autor et al., 2022). To prevent deskilling and mitigate the risk of brain drain to developed countries, it is essential for developing countries to improve labour market opportunities, provide continuous upskilling training and establish clear career development pathways. The private sector plays a leading role in AI, due to the concentration of resources, expertise and substantial financial investments within large multinational enterprises. Yet such companies can collaborate with Governments and academia on capacity-building initiatives that foster quality employment, such as placement programmes, apprenticeships and industry\u2013 academia research partnerships.",

Smaller developing countries may have less power to negotiate for socially beneficial public\u2013private partnerships, but can still aim to maintain or improve standards and avoid a dangerous race to the bottom. A worker-centric approach is part of a more general strategy to prepare for advances in AI, which is addressed in chapter III. 64 Annex II Firm-level studies on AI productivity gains Table 1 Summary of firm-level studies on AI productivity gains Study Economy (year) Method Measurement Effect sizes and standard error Remarks Acemoglu et al.

Notes: Due to limitations in research design, most studies do not fully isolate AI productivity effects from firms\u2019 self-selection into AI use, that is, they cannot infer direct causality between AI use and firms\u2019 productivity increases and part of the reported productivity gains is likely driven by unobserved confounding firm characteristics, such as prior levels of productivity and willingness to adopt new technology. Many of the studies do not establish a statistically significant link between AI adoption in firms and productivity increases, for example Acemoglu et al. (2020) and Babina et al. (2024); some studies find no significant productivity effects for firms on average, but strong effects for particular types of firms, such as Song and Cho (2023), who identify zero productivity gains for the average firm in the Republic of Korea that",

For the firms identified in this study and others, their uniquely large productivity gains may suggest within-firm mechanisms that are conducive to AI productivity effects; for example, Song and Cho (2023) show that the productivity increase in multi-plant firms originates from the creation of inter-plant channels that enable the narrowing of performance gaps between plants. 66 References Abdikaparov N (2024).

Institute for Human-Centered AI, Stanford University, United States. 71 Chapter III Preparing to seize AI opportunities Developing countries need to prepare themselves for a world that is rapidly being reshaped by AI and other frontier technologies. A useful measure in assessing national preparedness to use, adopt and adapt frontier technologies is the UNCTAD frontier technologies readiness index. Developed countries lead the ranking, but some developing countries, notably Singapore, China, and India, hold prominent positions. Moreover, some countries perform better than their levels of income may suggest, demonstrating strong potential to seize opportunities offered by frontier technologies and boost economic development. This chapter further examines the key factors in AI adoption and development, highlighting the urgent need for improved infrastructure, data and skills in developing countries. Assessing readiness and identifying relative strengths and weaknesses in AI can guide the development of strategic plans and catch-up pathways. Technology and Innovation Report 2025 \u00a9 Adobe Stock Governments should strategically position themselves to seize the opportunities offered by AI. This involves assessing national AI capacities across the three leverage points of infrastructure, data and skills; and identifying gaps to pinpoint areas of action. Different catch-up trajectories can steer the transition from current technological and productive capacities towards desired targets. Evaluating AI opportunities and challenges, through technology assessment and foresight exercises, helps identify actions to strengthen the innovation system. UNCTAD assists developing countries in technology assessment, and its Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) Policy Review Programme supports the development of STI policies. A successful structural transformation requires cooperation among public authorities and ministries, such as those for STI, industry and education. Stakeholder engagement is crucial to identify AI solutions for sustainable development and to formulate STI plans that align with national objectives. Key policy takeaways 74 A. The frontier technologies readiness index 1 The BRICS group of countries has developed into an intergovernmental organization that includes Brazil, the Russian Federation, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, the Islamic Republic of Iran and the United Arab Emirates. To offer a comprehensive measure of each country\u2019s preparedness for frontier technologies, UNCTAD has devised the frontier technologies readiness index (UNCTAD, 2021). This combines indicators for ICT deployment, skills, research and development (R&D) activity, industrial capacity and access to finance. First launched along with the Technology and Innovation Report 2021, the index covers 170 countries, including 124 developing countries (see annex III). As in previous years, the index rankings are dominated by developed countries in Europe and North America (table III.1). Developing countries generally rank lower, but Singapore stands out in fifth position and performs well across all the index\u2019s dimensions. Some BRICS countries also have good ranking positions, notably China, at 21; the Russian Federation, at 33; India, at 36; Brazil, at 38; and South Africa, at 52.",

The countries least prepared for frontier technologies are predominantly in Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean. Between 2022 and 2024, the index shows that many developing countries experienced notable improvements. Argentina, Chile, China, North Macedonia and Uruguay, for example, increased their positions in ICT, thanks to significant rises in mean download speeds. Meanwhile, Bhutan, India, Morocco, the Republic of Moldova and Timor-Leste improved their positions in human capital, due to more years of schooling and a greater share of high-skill employment in their working populations. Angola and Barbados made progress in the R&D subindex, with more scientific publications and patents filed on frontier technologies. Armenia, Bahamas, Chad and Maldives moved up in the industry subindex due to higher shares of high-technology manufacturing exports. Trade data fluctuate and short-term changes should therefore be interpreted with caution. Burundi and Timor-Leste registered improvements in the finance subindex, with a higher share of domestic credit going to the private sector as a proportion of GDP that, if channelled toward productive investments, can support the adoption or development of frontier technologies. The frontier technologies readiness index highlights areas for improvement, to enable the development, adoption and adaptation of these technologies. It also shows the strengths and weaknesses of country groups. It is important to emphasize that differences in rankings may not accurately reflect the disparities in underlying capacities. Actual levels of readiness are better indicated by countries\u2019 scores. Figure III.1 presents the average scores across the subindices for developed countries, developing countries and least developed countries (LDCs). As expected, developed countries consistently outperform in all dimensions of the readiness index. However, differences vary across subindices. Figure III.1 Frontier technologies readiness subindices score, selected country groupings Source: UNCTAD. 0.5 1 Skills ICT R&D Industry Finance Developed countries Developing countries LDCs Average score by country grouping Gap wider for LDCs Gap wider for developing countries 76 The skills subindex reveals significant differences between country groups. On average, LDCs register scores that are less than half of those of developing countries and less than one third of those of developed countries. The difference between developed and developing countries is narrower on the ICT subindex, although LDCs remain some way behind developing countries. A similar pattern is observed in the R&D and industry subindices, with wide disparities between developed and developing countries, but narrower disparities between developing countries and LDCs. With regard to finance, differences among country groupings are less marked.",

With regard to finance, differences among country groupings are less marked. It might be expected that countries with higher per capita GDP are better prepared for frontier technologies. Overall this is true but, as shown in figure III.2, some countries perform far better than their levels of income may suggest, as indicated by their distance from the regression line of the index score on GDP per capita. Among developing countries, outperformers are Brazil, China, India and the Philippines; among developed countries, outperformers are the Republic of Korea, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. There are correspondingly large differences in their rankings for GDP per capita and their rankings for the overall index; for India, 76 places; for China and the Philippines, 49 places; and for Brazil, 41 places.

A common feature of the better performing countries is greater R&D activity and stronger industry capacities, which enable them to keep pace with technological development and eventually lead in some frontier technologies.2 This highlights the importance of making efforts to improve a country\u2019s innovation ecosystem. Chapter IV discusses policy efforts that support the adoption and development of AI. 2 Outperformers compared to their economic performances show an average R&D score that is almost double with respect to other economies and an industry score that is about 50 per cent higher. It is also notable that the readiness index correlates positively with the number of AI publications (figure III.3). AI publications are among the variables of the R&D subindex and some correlation is expected. Nevertheless, the components contributing the most to the index score are those related to skills and industry and all of the subindices correlate positively with AI publications even when controlling for GDP per capita, population size and regional factors. Countries above the regression line produce more scientific knowledge than might be expected by their index score. For example, China, Germany, India, the United Kingdom and the United States show scientific strength in the field of AI. The technology readiness index is strongly associated with the generation of scientific knowledge in AI Figure III.3 Correlation between index score and knowledge generation in AI Source: UNCTAD calculations, based on data from Scopus.

Key factors in the adoption and development of AI The information offered in the frontier technologies readiness index can be complemented by a detailed assessment of each country\u2019s strengths and weaknesses in the adoption and development of AI. A technological wave unfolds in several phases. The initial development phase involving conceptualization or invention is often lengthy and costly. The adoption phase occurs when the technology begins to gain traction and early adopters start applying it to real-world problems. Finally, as the technology is diffused, it becomes more accessible and affordable and is more widely integrated into economies and societies. Widespread adoption often drives further innovation, which can lead to a renewed development phase. The initial development of new technologies is typically driven by developed countries.",

The adoption phase occurs when the technology begins to gain traction and early adopters start applying it to real-world problems. Finally, as the technology is diffused, it becomes more accessible and affordable and is more widely integrated into economies and societies. Widespread adoption often drives further innovation, which can lead to a renewed development phase. The initial development of new technologies is typically driven by developed countries. Developing countries mostly only adopt frontier technologies, although some of the more technologically advanced developing countries may soon start adapting the technologies to their own conditions, which contributes to further development. This mirrors the classic company dilemma of whether to adopt innovations or to develop them, a choice that depends on contextual factors and own capabilities. Moving from AI proof-of-concept to large- scale roll-out may be more challenging than expected, and it is important to identify areas in which AI can be strategically deployed to make a real impact (Cohen and Levinthal, 1989; Teece, 1986; Teece et al., 1997). The rate of diffusion of AI among citizens and society depends on basic factors, including access to the Internet, electricity and digital devices, as well as basic and AI-relevant digital skills. While adoption leverages those technologies that best align with existing socioeconomic structures and needs, development involves a more active role in shaping the direction of technological change. Adoption AI adoption involves using existing AI technologies to improve tasks and business processes, as well as adapting AI systems to particular sectoral needs. Most of the evidence on AI adoption comes from advanced economies in which large businesses are increasingly integrating AI into their practices and services. In 2024, a global survey showed that 72 per cent of large businesses used AI in some capacity. To date, they are largely using generative AI (GenAI) for the marketing and product development of information technology functions and less in manufacturing or supply-chain management (Singla et al., 2024). Most of this activity is by larger firms that have the greatest resources, and the share of AI users in firms with more than 250 persons is generally double that of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) (OECD, 2023a). In some countries, differences may be even greater. In Italy, for example, one study showed that the probability of investing in AI could be more than five times higher for larger firms than smaller ones (Montresor and Vezzani, 2023). It should be noted that a comprehensive understanding of AI adoption is generally hindered by a shortage of systematic evidence, particularly from developing countries, which may constrain the capacity to design effective policies and interventions. It is important to identify areas in which AI can be strategically deployed to make a real impact SMEs face limiting factors that hinder widespread AI adoption 79 Chapter III Preparing to seize AI opportunities Development AI development includes all aspects related to the creation of new AI solutions, which includes the development of new models or algorithms and the improvement of existing ones, as well as all of the necessary resources and infrastructure to sustain the AI industry, such as computing power or the assembly of a cohort of developers trained to use new types of algorithms and data. AI development is scaling up quickly. The number of AI publications and patents is growing exponentially (see chapter I). The number of English-language AI study programmes globally has almost tripled since 2017, and the proportion of computer science students specializing in AI has doubled since 2015 (Maslej et al., 2024). In general, compared with adoption, development requires more advanced infrastructure, robust data systems and greater technological capabilities and skills, which are more likely to be found in developed countries. Developing countries may be able to take advantage of open-source models, which can help diffuse AI capacities worldwide. However, AI development requires building up robust infrastructure and innovation ecosystems and for some developing countries, it may be more viable to first prioritize adoption and adaptation. Developing a domestic AI industry from scratch can be an expensive and lengthy endeavour. Creating AI models requires highly educated and skilled developers and engineers, who need professional and industrial opportunities to gain experience.",

Developing a domestic AI industry from scratch can be an expensive and lengthy endeavour. Creating AI models requires highly educated and skilled developers and engineers, who need professional and industrial opportunities to gain experience. Moreover, the AI industry is being driven by relatively young firms leveraging knowledge and software rather than physical assets, for whom attracting financing is based less on past performance and more on long-term market potential. C. Three critical leverage points for AI adoption and development The adoption and development of AI critically depends on the three leverage points of infrastructure, data and skills. Infrastructure refers to digital connectivity and computing power, and the associated networks, architecture and resources necessary to create, train and use AI solutions across a community or country. Data are necessary for training AI models, with dedicated data for applying models to different use cases. Data are not only an input but are also generated through AI systems. Skills include basic digital and advanced AI- specific skills, as well as the complementary skills needed for a cohesive workforce that can effectively create and use AI. The elements of infrastructure, data and skills are needed in both adoption and development (table III.2). Although some elements may be relevant to both processes, it helps to identify particular AI requirements for more detailed analyses. Each element contributes to technological progress, but only together can they fully catalyse AI diffusion. Such interactions have led to breakthroughs such as deep learning and GenAI that have redefined the technology landscape. By supporting development in these critical leverage points, decision makers can trigger transformational economic cascades. Lack of systematic evidence from developing countries limits their capacity to design effective interventions Developing countries can catalyze transformative changes by focusing on the three key leverage points for AI 80 Policy and governance for AI can serve to determine the overall direction, setting institutional or cultural guardrails, and creating a socioeconomic and structural context favourable to the development of AI ecosystems. Chapter IV further elaborates on domestic policies involving AI and chapter V reviews the state of global AI governance and how it can support efforts to guarantee that AI will benefit all. Infrastructure The adoption of AI relies on basic infrastructure such as electricity and the Internet. While over 90 per cent of the world\u2019s population has access to electricity (IEA et al., 2023), about 2.6 billion people are still offline and most of them are in rural areas (ITU, 2023). AI infrastructure can be divided into two broad categories, namely, digital connectivity, which is largely related to information and communications technology (ICT); and computing power, often referred to as AI compute. They provide foundational support and linkages between actors and systems (figure III.4). Both require reliable and affordable energy and water resources. Digital connectivity is often categorized into three segments. First, cross-border terrestrial and submarine cables and satellite linkages which provide access to global networks. Second, middle-mile networks are responsible for the distribution of traffic within countries, including content delivery networks and backbone networks. Third, last-mile or access networks are responsible for providing connectivity to individuals, households and businesses, typically consisting of fixed or mobile cellular networks. The increased use of AI systems and complementary technologies puts pressure on all digital connectivity segments (World Bank, 2021; ITU, 2022). Although most countries have ICT networks, these often do not extend much beyond densely populated areas. They may be partially complemented by mobile connectivity for small-scale businesses and private users, but AI adoption is likely to be constrained, particularly for industrial uses (Bentley et al., 2024). As well as connections, end users also need affordable digital devices to connect to ICT networks and any associated hardware, as well as basic computing power. The last-mile limitations of telecommunications infrastructure in many developing countries indicate that, to close digital divides, one of the priorities should be universal digital connectivity.

The increasing computational requirements for creating and training AI algorithms are being driven by an industry oriented towards multitasking and complex models. Handling large amounts of data and reducing operating times requires efficient data centres, high- speed networks and supercomputers. AI compute requires increasingly complex semiconductors to address AI and big data requirements.3 Most are produced by a handful of firms worldwide; when supplies are limited due to demand spikes or shocks, developing countries may therefore be last in line.4 Computing resources and elements also include 3 The electronics value chain begins with the extraction of raw minerals for the creation of computing hardware and semiconductors. The extraction of minerals takes place mainly in developing countries, for example, in 2023, Chile, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Peru provided about half of the global output of copper, a key raw material in electronic devices (UNCTAD, 2024a). 4 For instance, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a global chip shortage that was greater than the concomitant decrease in demand, negatively affecting several value chains, such as that of the automotive sector (Ramani et al., 2022; Burkacky et al., 2022). 5 Advances in algorithms and architectures that have reduced computing power needs have not been able to compensate for the escalating computational requirements of modern machine-learning systems, which have grown by several orders of magnitude in the last decade (Sevilla et al., 2022; Thompson et al., 2022). storage, security, backup systems, data centres and cloud computing. These core elements are often already available in many countries but need to be continuously upgraded or replaced to support the application and development of AI.5 Much of digital and cloud computing operates across national borders, relying on interoperable infrastructure and protocols. GenAI in particular requires accurate and increasing amounts of data, generally through large bandwidth and international connectivity. Efforts to reduce latency times and data transit costs have spurred the deployment of data centres closer to users (Richins et al., 2020). This trend can be accelerated by requirements to locate data in a particular territory or by setting standards for privacy or cybersecurity (UNCTAD, 2021). Figure III.4 Key components of AI infrastructure Source: UNCTAD.

Too complex to be effectively processed by traditional processing approaches and platforms, huge and diverse data sets are better addressed by machine- learning and deep-learning algorithms, to produce new and transformative insights (Philip Chen and Zhang, 2014). The ability of AI models to analyse and learn from data is determined by their quantity, quality and accessibility (figure III.5). However, online data stocks are growing more slowly than the demands from AI, with the risk of shortages that can lead to data bottlenecks (Villalobos et al., 2024).",

Too complex to be effectively processed by traditional processing approaches and platforms, huge and diverse data sets are better addressed by machine- learning and deep-learning algorithms, to produce new and transformative insights (Philip Chen and Zhang, 2014). The ability of AI models to analyse and learn from data is determined by their quantity, quality and accessibility (figure III.5). However, online data stocks are growing more slowly than the demands from AI, with the risk of shortages that can lead to data bottlenecks (Villalobos et al., 2024). An emerging challenge is how to train and operate AI models more efficiently, to produce trustworthy results from more limited data (Muennighoff et al., 2023). AI adoption and customization require access to domain-specific data (e.g. geographical, industrial, cultural) that matches the use-case of AI models and solutions. Increasingly, data requirements overlap with infrastructure needs (e.g. data storage and processing), particularly for SMEs in traditional sectors, for which the costs of setting up and handling information technology systems can be prohibitive. The sectoral rollout of AI thus needs fine-tuning, with consideration given to field-specific needs. Compared with adoption, AI development requires larger and more diverse data, to create, train and test foundation models that are generalizable and can be applied to a variety of use cases. Yet the concentration of control over large data sets by a few platform companies may limit opportunities for value generation based on data, including through AI development. This can hinder efforts to catch up, particularly for firms from developing countries. Moreover, AI does not solve the \u201cgarbage in, garbage out\u201d problem. If the data sets do not, for example, fully represent different groups or cultures, by gender, by underserved communities or by language, then algorithms are likely to produce biased, incomplete or misleading results. Biases, fabrications or hallucinations (i.e. incorrect or misleading results) can be exacerbated when data produced by AI are used as inputs to train other AI models. The power of AI strongly relies on data quality, quantity and accessibility Figure III.5 Data requirements for AI Source: UNCTAD. AI model Data Quality \u2022 Unbiased \u2022 Standardized \u2022 Interoperable Access \u2022 Security \u2022 Privacy Quantity \u2022 High volume \u2022 High variety 83 Chapter III Preparing to seize AI opportunities Data should be easily available and affordable for developers and users, and standardized and interoperable for quality assurance and efficient processing. At the same time, it is important to respect property rights, as well as privacy and security. The acquisition, processing and use of data should comply with legal and ethical norms and requirements with regard to privacy and data ownership, with security and anonymization procedures used to protect personal information. The importance of global data governance is discussed in chapter V. Skills The adoption and development of AI depends on human efforts and skills. Engineers and computer scientists are needed in designing and producing computer chips and coding algorithms. At the same time, end-users require both digital skills and industry-specific knowledge to adopt and adapt AI. Even if an economy has access, awareness and sufficient funds to adopt AI, this may still not suffice unless there are skilled workers who can use AI or identify opportunities for its use throughout the economy (Chui and Malhotra, 2018). Universal digital literacy provides a foundation for the inclusive use of frontier technologies and AI systems (figure III.6). However, adopting AI also requires the applied technical knowledge of AI in practice and transversal supporting skills (El-Adaileh and Foster, 2019). Furthermore, the adoption and development of AI requires constant flows of data from different industries and domains, along with experts on particular subjects, who can integrate AI systems with their domains. Workers and the public need to learn how to participate in the AI ecosystem and develop their skill sets, for which reskilling is as important as formal education. For example, to employ GenAI effectively, users need to learn how to structure instructions that can be understood by GenAI, called prompt engineering. One study shows that many AI users enjoy using AI in the workplace and elsewhere but are concerned about potential job losses and that AI will decrease wages (Lane et al., 2023). With AI advancing rapidly, reskilling is just as crucial as formal education Figure III.6 Skills for adopting and developing AI Source: UNCTAD.",

Formal education and continuous learning Society AI users AI developers Basic digital literacy Sector-speci\ufb01c and transversal skills Advanced digital skills (e.g. data science, machine learning) 84 Creating and training new AI models requires developers who are highly skilled and have acquired technical knowledge, often through tertiary education in mathematics and computer science. The foundation for this is formal education, followed by regular training. All developers need foundational data science and computing skills, as well as AI-specific training, and research and development opportunities across industry and academia. The development of AI also requires non-technical cognitive skills for creative problem-solving (OECD, 2023b). D. Assessing preparedness for AI adoption and development With regard to national preparedness for AI, countries may be considered under the following four categories according to adoption and development capacities, as shown in figure III.7: a) Leaders \u2013 High capacities for both AI adoption and development. b) Creators \u2013 High capacity for AI development, but relatively low capacity for adoption. c) Practitioners \u2013 Low capacity for AI development but high capacity for adoption. d) Laggards \u2013 Low capacities for both AI adoption and development. The four categories of AI preparedness help assess a country\u2019s current position, illustrating its relative strengths and weaknesses as well as its potential catch- up trajectories (e.g. from laggards to practitioners, then to leaders). The following overview of country preparedness uses proxy indicators that have wide country coverage for infrastructure, data and skills. These can be complemented by insights from the frontier technologies readiness index and refined through detailed reviews of STI ecosystems. The analysis uses indicators for intensity and level, to capture different mechanisms influencing AI adoption and development. Figure III.7 Classification of countries according to capacity for AI adoption and development Source: UNCTAD. AI adoption capacity AI development capacity Low adoption Low development Laggards Low adoption High development Creators High adoption High development Leaders High adoption Low development Practitioners 85 Chapter III Preparing to seize AI opportunities For instance, the proportion of the population with Internet access reflects the potential extent of AI adoption within an economy. Higher levels of data creation and transmission proxy instead a country\u2019s potential for AI development. In assessing national preparedness, comparisons of intensity and level illustrate how the strategic options for AI can be determined by country size. AI infrastructure preparedness On average, developed countries have the highest incidence of Internet penetration and LDCs have less than half of the incidence in developing countries (figure III.8). Similarly, investments in telecommunications services are the lowest among LDCs. Both developing countries and LDCs show high variability in the two indicators. In the top right quadrant, the leaders are largely developed countries in Europe and North America, but also some middle- and high-income economies in Asia. In the bottom right, the creators include India and Nigeria, which have high levels of investments in telecommunications services, although less than half their populations have stable Internet access. Figure III.8 AI infrastructure preparedness Source: UNCTAD calculations, based on data from the ITU DataHub.

In the bottom left quadrant, the laggards include several countries in Africa, such as Burundi and Chad, which have low levels of Internet penetration and investments in telecommunications services, and risk being excluded from the development opportunities offered by AI. Some middle-income developing countries show high capacities for both AI adoption and development. In Africa, for instance, Egypt and Morocco exceed the global averages in both indicators. This is partly due to the submarine cables under the Mediterranean that connect them to the European continent and beyond. Egypt, for example, due to its geographical position, and links to more than 160 global submarine cable operators, can become a hub connecting three continents. Between 2009 and 2020, the number of submarine cables to Egypt increased from 6 to 13 and after 2025, is expected to exceed 18 (Telecom Egypt, 2024). In Asia, the better performers include Malaysia, Singapore and Viet Nam, which have been improving their digital infrastructure. In Malaysia, for example, the Ministry of Digital created the Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation in 1996, aiming to establish the country as a digital hub in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation, 2022). In 2023, the Government introduced the digital ecosystem acceleration scheme, to further strengthen digital infrastructure through a series of incentives, such as investment tax credits on capital expenditure (Malaysian Investment Development Authority, 2023). Countries in South-East Asia have generally attracted significant investment from major technology companies. In 2024, to advance new cloud and AI infrastructure, Microsoft announced an investment of $1.7 billion in Indonesia and $2.2 billion in Malaysia (Microsoft, 2024a, 2024b). In 2024, Google planned to invest $2 billion in Malaysia, to develop a data centre and cloud hub (Cyrill, 2024). In 2025, Amazon Web Services aims to launch a new hub in Thailand and invest $5 billion by 2037 (Amazon, 2024). A core element of such investment is cloud infrastructure, which offers computing capabilities and storage with flexible access and at a relatively low cost, thereby supporting AI diffusion among SMEs. Cross- country comparisons are hindered by a lack of internationally comparable statistics, yet it may be noted that cloud computing is strongly concentrated among a few large providers; an indicator of availability is therefore the number of services (UNCTAD, 2024a). With regard to the top 10 economies in terms of cloud infrastructure services from major providers, China and the United States have more services than the rest of the world combined; India and Brazil are two developing countries on the list along with Singapore, and four of the top 10 countries in terms of cloud infrastructure are thus from the Global South (figure III.9). With regard to cloud services by region, it may be noted that even if China is not included, Asia stands out. In addition to China, Japan, the Republic of Korea and Singapore, there are several cloud infrastructure services in South-East Asia. Africa is some way behind. At the end of 2023, eight companies controlled about 80 per cent of the worldwide market share, led by Amazon, Microsoft and Google (Synergy, 2024).",

At the end of 2023, eight companies controlled about 80 per cent of the worldwide market share, led by Amazon, Microsoft and Google (Synergy, 2024). These companies may have limited interest in countries that do not generate enough data traffic and profits, which could contribute to deepening digital and AI divides between countries. Countries can leverage private companies to improve their digital infrastructure 87 Chapter III Preparing to seize AI opportunities AI data preparedness ITU has set the affordability target for fixed broadband at 2 per cent of gross national income per capita. On average, developed countries score better in data affordability, with many developing countries and LDCs still far from the ITU target (figure III.10). The gap between developed and developing countries for data traffic is narrower, with LDCs lagging behind.6 Among the leaders, China performs well in both affordability and data quantity. A number of high-income economies, such as Hong Kong (China), Germany, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom and the United States, also have a wealth of data that can be used to train and develop AI systems. Creators include Pakistan and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, which have low levels of adoption but a high development potential. 6 Although mobile networks record a higher number of subscriptions, 83 per cent of world data traffic takes place through fixed networks (ITU, 2024). Practitioners include smaller economies such as Eswatini, Kuwait and Monaco that have high levels of AI adoption but a relatively low development potential; their small populations limit the data available for local AI models. Laggards, which show low potential in both AI adoption and development, are mostly developing countries in Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean. China has the world\u2019s greatest fixed- broadband traffic, due to its large population and because it has significantly reduced fixed-broadband prices, from around 5 per cent of gross national income a decade prior to 0.5 per cent at present, which is about one sixth of the global median (ITU, 2024). The Government has put in place regulatory reforms to increase competition among Internet service providers while encouraging new market entrants. The fibre-optic network has been upgraded and expanded to enhance connectivity in rural and underserved areas. China has reduced fixed broadband prices, to favour digital uptake Figure III.9 Number of cloud infrastructure services, mid-2024 Source: UNCTAD calculations, based on data from Cloud Infrastructure Map.

Additional information on data preparedness is available by analysing the number of Internet exchange points. These are physical locations where Internet service providers connect and exchange traffic between their networks and are a crucial element of middle-mile digital connectivity. Traffic per Internet exchange point is highest in high-income countries, although the average number of members per point is highest in upper middle-income economies, partly because they host some of the world\u2019s largest Internet exchange points, such as Ponto de Troca de Tr\u00e1fego Metro S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil, Qianhai New-Type Internet Exchange in China and Moscow Internet Exchange in the Russian Federation.

In contrast, Africa is far behind, with limited participation and data flows. AI skills preparedness GitHub is a major platform through which developers can collaborate, and hosts a large number of open-source projects.7 Country groupings illustrate the differences in AI skills preparedness, with LDCs scoring rather low in both GitHub developers as a share of the working-age population and the proportion of the working-age population with tertiary education. With some noticeable exceptions, developed countries rank better than developing countries in both indicators (figure III.12). 7 GitHub is the most widely used developers\u2019 platform in the world to create, manage and share code. Due to its open approach, the platform is largely used by developers from both the public and private sectors, as well as from industry and academia, making it a reasonable proxy indicator for AI development capacity. The leaders in the top-right quadrant are mainly developed economies, such as Canada, Ireland, the Republic of Korea, and the United States. Hong Kong (China) and Singapore have particularly high numbers of GitHub developers. Countries in the bottom-right quadrant have low AI adoption but high development potential and include developed economies in Europe, such as Romania, and some island countries such as Maldives and Seychelles. There are relatively few economies with high potential in AI adoption but low development capacity. In fact, most developing economies display relatively low skills capacity for both adoption and development. The proportion of developers in the population does not tell the whole story. Large countries may have a low proportion of developers, but this could still represent a substantial body of developers on which to build AI development advantages.

China and India have the world\u2019s largest populations and, despite relatively low shares, can leverage a significant mass of AI developers, which puts them in favourable positions with respect to AI development and the production of AI-related scientific knowledge. Many developing countries have achieved rapid growth in the number of developers (figure III.14). The fastest increase, at 40 per cent, was in Nigeria, Ghana and Kenya, which have become promising hubs for technology companies (Daigle, 2023). The growth in developer numbers is also notable in Latin America and the Caribbean, for example in Argentina, the Plurinational State of Bolivia, Colombia and Brazil. In Asia and the Pacific, India, Viet Nam, Indonesia and the Philippines already had a significant number of developers but had increases of more than 30 per cent.

There are large talent pools in India, with around 13 million developers, and in Brazil, with 4 million. These two countries are also among the leading countries in creating GenAI projects on GitHub, and are significant contributors to advances in AI. The lead of India partly reflects government policy. The Government has closely collaborated over the years with the private sector and academia to build centres of excellence, such as the Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad and the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur in AI, the Kotak Indian Institute of Science Artificial Intelligence\u2013Machine Learning Centre and the National Association of Software and Service Companies centre of excellence in data science and AI. In 2024, the Cabinet approved the India AI mission to strengthen the AI innovation ecosystem, aimed at, for example, reducing barriers to entry into AI programmes and increasing the number of AI courses in tertiary education, focusing on small and medium-sized cities (India, Competition Commission, 2024",

For example, through strategic partnerships between public and private institutions, the Research Foundation of the state of S\u00e3o Paulo has created a network of applied research centres (Brazil, Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovations, 2021). The initiative is also aimed at creating scholarships to attract researchers and further boost performance in terms of AI publications (Brand\u00e3o, 2024). These approaches highlight the importance of training AI specialists to sustain the development of a strong and diffused AI ecosystem and attract and cultivate AI talent. 93 Chapter III Preparing to seize AI opportunities E. Strategic positioning for AI 8 For example, UNCTAD supports STI policymakers and other stakeholders in target countries in Africa in designing and implementing a technology assessment exercise in the energy and agricultural sectors and in taking action to utilize technologies as catalysts for sustainable development (UNCTAD, 2024b). To seize the opportunities offered by AI, developing countries need to strategically position themselves for structural transformation and provide a fertile environment in which AI-empowered businesses can thrive. Key to this is close cooperation among public authorities and ministries, such as those for STI, industry and education. These ministries can also work with stakeholders to identify and sustain AI applications for sustainable development, particularly those that incorporate social, economic and environmental considerations, such as creating and augmenting jobs and encouraging the green transition. Strategic positioning to leverage AI for sustainable development can be coupled with a gap analysis to link the vision with actual actions, to make it a reality. The frontier technologies readiness index helps identify areas in which countries need to improve. This chapter offers country snapshots and Governments should carry out more comprehensive assessments of strengths and weaknesses and of capabilities and gaps along the three critical leverage points of infrastructure, data and skills. The key elements shown in table III.2 can be used as starting points for actions to empower agents, who can operate along the five As framework (box III.1). In addition, a thorough assessment of AI-related opportunities and challenges, along with foresight exercises on longer- term science and technology scenarios, can help identify actions to direct an economy towards preferred futures. Technology assessment should include stakeholder engagements to map the STI ecosystem and formulate STI plans that align with national objectives and the opportunities and challenges posed by frontier technologies. UNCTAD helps developing countries in technology assessment and its STI Policy Review programme supports STI system policies and plans (UNCTAD, 2019).8 Based on a gap analysis, countries can establish their own catch-up trajectories, to move from current technological and productive capacities to the desired targets. Some developing countries in Africa and South-East Asia have strengthened their infrastructure to support Internet usage and cross-border connectivity. China has established a strong advantage in data affordability and quantity. China, Brazil and India have produced a large pool of AI developers. These illustrate different catch-up trajectories and highlight the importance of policy efforts in order to enhance preparedness in the light of the rapid evolution of AI. Technological catch-up is closely tied to a country\u2019s readiness to embrace new technological waves.",

Technological catch-up is closely tied to a country\u2019s readiness to embrace new technological waves. The adoption and development of AI hinge on the necessary digital infrastructure, capacity for data collection and transmission and a mix of sector-specific and digital skills, which can be strengthened by dynamic interactions between users and producers. Close cooperation across public bodies is key in triggering a technology- led structural transformation Strategic positioning starts with a thorough assessment of the AI opportunities and challenges 94 \u00a9 Adobe Stock 94 Technology and Innovation Report 2025 Inclusive Artificial Intelligence for Development Box III.1 The five As framework for AI adoption and development The diffusion of technologies and innovations is shaped by communications and interaction among economic agents and the way the innovation system works. Frontier technologies need to be taken up by agents \u2013 entrepreneurs, citizens and policymakers \u2013 who can be empowered through a combination of the 5 As, namely, availability, affordability, awareness, ability and agency. Source: UNCTAD. Availability and affordability are critical in the widespread adoption of AI, providing equitable opportunities across diverse groups and communities. Limited digital infrastructure and data, combined with challenges in affordability, risk widening the gap between leading and lagging countries. Awareness about frontier technologies and successful implementation examples empowers agents to leverage AI for economic progress. Understanding AI applications, potential uses, risks and limitations is key in their beneficial diffusion, as well as for policymakers facing different options to guide progress and development. Ability and agency drive meaningful change. Laggard countries may lack the scientific and technological expertise of countries leading in AI but should aim to customize technology to local needs while addressing potential social, cultural and institutional barriers. Achieving inclusive and equitable AI development hinges on fostering knowledge, active engagement and the power to direct AI towards serving human development. For instance, computing power is central to both AI adoption and development. Its availability enables users to implement and scale AI solutions and to experiment with new algorithms and applications. Affordable computing power can reduce barriers to AI research and development and deployment. Key factors such as data storage capacities, processing speeds and cloud computing capacities determine the performance and efficiency of AI algorithms and models. Public awareness, ability and agency are essential in seizing business opportunities and addressing potential concerns while fostering the societal acceptance of AI. The benefits of computing power can be fully realized by users equipped with strong technical knowledge and digital skills, while agency over computing power allows them to customize digital environments for AI, to meet particular requirements, optimize performance and ensure efficiency.

In general, hardware development is associated with product innovation and is typically organized along with formal R&D and strong industry and university linkages (Lema et al., 2021). The software segment is linked to processes and service innovations, which rely on widely dispersed informal activities and interactions among developers, users and global actors. Such interactions require a rethinking of industrial and innovation policies that is discussed in the next chapter.

Technical note on methodology The frontier technologies readiness index is calculated following the methodology in Technology and Innovation Report 2021. The indicators that compose the index are listed in table 6. Table 6 Frontier technologies readiness index: Indicators Category Indicator (measure) Source of data ICT deployment Internet users (share of population) ITU ICT deployment Mean download speed (megabits per second) M-Lab Skills Expected years of schooling UNDP Skills High-skill employment (share of working population) ILO R&D activity Number of scientific publications on frontier technologies Scopus R&D activity Number of patents filed on frontier technologies PatSeer Industry activity High-technology manufactures exports (share of total merchandise trade) UNCTAD Industry activity Digitally deliverable services exports (share of total services trade) UNCTAD Access to finance Domestic credit to private sector (share of GDP) World Bank, IMF, OECD Source: UNCTAD. The underlying indicator data are statistically manipulated to form the index. First, the data are imputed using the cold deck imputation method, retroactively filling in the missing values with the latest values available from the same country. Second, the Z-score standardization is conducted, using the following formula: where x is a value to be standardized; \u03bc is the mean of the population; and \u03c3 is the standard deviation of the population. The standardized value of each indicator is then normalized to fall between the range of 0 to 1 using the following formula: where x is a Z-score standardized score to be normalized; Max is the largest score in the population; and Min is the smallest score in the population. A principal component analysis (PCA) is then conducted, to remove correlated features among indicators and reduce overfitting. Based on the variance explained criteria method, the PCA finds that three principal components can retain over 80 per cent of the variation. The final index is therefore derived by assigning the weights generated by PCA with varimax rotation to the three principal components, then standardized and normalized to fall within the range of 0 to 1. 107 Frontier technologies readiness index = ((0.4/0.8)*(PC1)+(0.28/0.8)*(PC2)+(0.12/0.8)*(PC3))standarized & normalized Separately, PCA is conducted on each building block of the index, to derive the score and country ranking.",

Chapter III Preparing to seize AI opportunities 110 111 Chapter IV Designing national policies for AI National competitiveness increasingly relies on science, technology and innovation (STI) and knowledge-intensive services. Developing countries therefore need to design strategies and industrial policies, taking into account the role of knowledge-intensive services and the uncertainties around research and development (R&D). They should also consider the diffusion, direction and impact of frontier technologies in the economy to adapt catch-up strategies accordingly. To date, most AI policies have come from developed countries. By the end of 2023, about two thirds of developed countries had a national AI strategy, while only six out of the 89 national AI strategies were from least developed countries (LDCs). AI policies implemented by major economies can have significant spillovers, influencing the policy options of other countries. Developing countries should quickly set and implement AI strategies that align with their national development goals and agendas. While it may be more immediately feasible to support AI adoption for particular sectoral needs, developing countries should also make long-term strategic plans to steer their own AI development; otherwise, as latecomers, they may be left with few options. This chapter focuses on a new wave of industrial policies for AI and frontier technologies to strengthen national capacities and drive inclusive, innovation-led growth. It highlights good practices and lessons learned, with an emphasis on infrastructure, data and skills. Technology and Innovation Report 2025 \u00a9 Adobe Stock Key policy takeaways New industrial policies \u2013 Accelerated digitalization and the rise of AI call for new industrial policies. As value in the global economy shifts toward knowledge-intensive activities, decision makers need to support the adoption and development of new technologies, as well as the creation, dissemination and absorption of productive knowledge. Coordination \u2013 National strategies should coordinate across domains, including STI, industry, education, infrastructure and trade. Moreover, AI policies should go beyond incentives such as tax deductions and include regulations, such as on consumer protection, digital platforms and data protection, along with governance and enforcement to orient the direction of technological change. Policies should address the three leverage points: Infrastructure \u2013 It is vital to ensure equitable access to enablers such as electricity and the Internet that facilitate AI adoption and reduce inequalities. This can be achieved by fostering a conducive business environment with incentives for private-sector investment. Distributed networks and computing power can also enable AI development, but it is important to ensure interoperability and harmonization between infrastructures and systems. Data \u2013 Open data and data-sharing enhance data integration, storage, access and collaboration. AI adoption and development rely on good practices in data collection, with interoperability and accessibility across the innovation ecosystem. Privacy, accountability and intellectual property aspects should also be addressed, to foster innovation while safeguarding human rights. Skills \u2013 Population-wide AI literacy promotes widespread AI adoption and can be achieved by integrating science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and AI subjects, from early education to continuous learning. Partnerships between academia and the private sector can help build AI talent to meet particular industry needs and drive AI development. 114 A.

Partnerships between academia and the private sector can help build AI talent to meet particular industry needs and drive AI development. 114 A. AI as part of industrial and innovation policies AI policies can be seen as part of industrial and innovation policies. They foster the development of AI algorithms and applications to build new activities in the digital domain. At the same time, they encourage AI adoption to improve businesses, diversify the economy and improve productivity and living standards. These dual goals \u2014 development and adoption \u2014 can guide policymakers in integrating frontier technologies into existing industries. Around one third of the world\u2019s population lacks Internet access (ITU, 2022), creating a digital divide that slows digital literacy and hinders full participation in AI use and development. Developing countries with weak digital infrastructure may not perceive AI as a national priority and simply react to rapid AI proliferation as it happens. Instead, they need to plan proactive AI policies. Some are concerned that greater regulation in developing countries might stifle AI innovation (Mwenda et al., 2024). However, industrial policies can foster innovation by coordinating other policy areas to create supportive environments (V\u00e4lil\u00e4, 2008). Effective AI policies can also address public concerns about data protection and privacy, and raise awareness about AI\u2019s risks and opportunities, to build trust and promote adoption (Agrawal et al., 2019). Traditionally, industrial policies have focused more narrowly on established industries and emphasized structural shifts, such as transitioning from agriculture to manufacturing or shifting within sectors to higher-productivity activities. A broader definition should encompass any government intervention aimed at improving the business environment or restructuring economic activity toward sectors, technologies or tasks that have better growth or societal welfare prospects (Warwick, 2013). From this perspective, structural change is an innovation-driven transformation in how a country, industry or market operates. Efforts to transform sectors and economies should support technological learning and skill upgrading, prioritize supportive infrastructure, anticipate future needs and build capabilities that foster positive spillovers. This is more difficult near the technological frontier, which demands more knowledge and skills, and where there is greater uncertainty, with higher risk of failure or unintended consequences. B. The revival of industrial policy Traditionally, industrial policies respond to market failures. These failures can arise from multiple factors, for example, information asymmetries, conflicting interests or excessive market power, that lead to an inefficient allocation of resources across the economy and can hinder development. Governments may also decide that certain goods and services can be best delivered by public provision as natural monopolies. The economic rationales typically associated with industrial policies are outlined in box IV.1. AI policies concern the development and adoption of AI to improve productivity and living standards AI policies can promote structural transformation and help seize new opportunities 115 Chapter IV Designing national policies for AI Over recent decades, industrial policies have to some extent been set aside, as Governments have liberalized economies and exposed them more to market forces. At present, industrial policy is moving back to centre stage, for example, to foster productive transformation, to protect the economy against external shocks, to guarantee the availability of key products and inputs, or to defend national enterprises from foreign competition (Gereffi, 2020). The global financial crisis of 2008/09, for example, and the COVID-19 pandemic, prompted Governments to support and direct national industrial development. Industrial policy has returned explicitly to the agenda of advanced economies, particularly in the United States (UNCTAD, 2024a), and with a focus on high-technology sectors. However, at the global level, this can limit positive spillovers, reducing the growth of public knowledge that contributes to the development of human capital. Box IV.1 Rationales for industrial policies Markets, left to their own dynamics, are unlikely to drive balanced structural change and the associated infrastructural investments. Therefore, Governments can intervene to explicitly target the structural transformation of economic activity in pursuit of public goals.",

Box IV.1 Rationales for industrial policies Markets, left to their own dynamics, are unlikely to drive balanced structural change and the associated infrastructural investments. Therefore, Governments can intervene to explicitly target the structural transformation of economic activity in pursuit of public goals. Commonly discussed rationales for industrial policies can be classified under three broad categories: \u2022 Externalities \u2013 Economic activities can affect societies in ways not reflected in company accounts. Pollution is a classic example of a negative externality, damaging the environment but not considered as a cost by businesses. Innovation, on the other hand, produces positive externalities in the form of learning and knowledge, from which inventors may gain only a small part of the overall value, reducing their incentives to innovate. \u2022 Coordination failures \u2013 The emergence of new activities is often related to the existence of complementary assets. Producers\u2019 profits typically depend on economic activities by others who create complementary knowledge, competences and skills. AI technology also requires complementary activities on a sufficient scale to support a successful digital transition, in the absence of which governments may need to step in to offer coordination and support. \u2022 Activity-specific public inputs \u2013 Private production relies on public goods such as regulations, education and infrastructure. Horizontal policies are aimed at providing such goods universally but may not do so sufficiently for particular needs. Frontier technologies, for example, require funding for infrastructure, STEM education and digital skill development, along with coordination among various ministries, to leverage synergies across interventions.

Because they are mostly linked to sectors and products, these interventions provide a proxy for the broad definition of industrial policies used in this report. New interventions do not necessarily substitute for existing interventions, and the number of policies therefore tends to increase, creating a complex environment in which less advanced countries or 1 The Global Trade Alert data set provides data on actions and acts in the economic playing field of Governments that can induce changes in international commercial flows (goods, services, investment or labour force migration), introducing market distortions or altering the relative treatment of domestic commercial interests. 2 For a list of the top 10 countries in terms of policy interventions, comparing the periods 2010\u20132011 and 2022\u2013 2023, see annex IV. In 2010\u20132011, the United States introduced the highest number of policy interventions, followed closely by Brazil, with China in third place, displaying a lower number of interventions. In 2022\u20132023, the United States ranked first and China matched the United States in terms of policy number of interventions; Brazil decreased the overall number of policies. small- and medium-enterprises (SMEs) with more limited resources find it more difficult to overcome barriers or identify opportunities (Evenett, 2019). Some countries have greater institutional capacity than others to design and implement industrial policies, an imbalance that could further widen gaps between developed and developing countries. A changing mix of policy interventions Over the past decade, there has also been a significant change in the types of interventions (table IV.1). The emphasis has shifted from measures to protect domestic industries, such as import tariffs and quotas and anti-dumping measures, to more direct support for productive sectors through financial grants, State loans and capital injections or production subsidies. Interventions have also become much more diversified. Developed countries account for two thirds of industrial policies; LDCs only 1.3 per cent Figure IV.",

Policy interventions may target sectors or particular types of firms such as SMEs, or be confined to certain locations (figure IV.2). Over the last decade, interventions have become more targeted. Governments seem to have aimed at picking winners or favoured incumbent firms and established markets rather than targeting failures in emerging ones. Industrial policies have been shifting towards direct interventions in productive sectors Table IV.1 A shift from trade protection to direct support for productive sectors (Most frequent types of interventions, percentage) Source: UNCTAD calculations, based on data from Global Trade Alert. 2010\u20132011 2022\u20132023 Intervention type Intervention type Import tariff 22.4 Financial grant 13.6 Anti-dumping 10.9 Import tariff 12.9 Price stabilization 10.7 State loan 9.3 State loan 9.7 Controls on commercial transactions and investment instruments 7.7 Trade finance 8.8 Export ban 5.9 Import tariff quota 7.8 Capital injection and equity stakes 3.6 Financial grant 6.9 Trade finance 3.6 Local content incentive 4.7 State aid, unspecified 3.5 Export tax 2.0 Import ban 3.5 Anti-subsidy 1.4 Production subsidy 3.0 Share of top 10 types of interventions 85.2 Share of top 10 types of interventions 66.6 118 C. Policies at the technological frontier 3 Intangible capital can be classified under three main categories, namely, digitalized information (i.e. software and databases), innovative property (e.g. R&D, design and related property rights) and economic competences (e.g. branding and business models), which are increasingly determining firms\u2019 and countries\u2019 competitiveness (Corrado et al., 2022). In recent decades, the rise of information and communication technologies (ICTs) has revolutionized telecommunications, reducing costs and improving reliability, while enabling advanced information management. This, coupled with falling transport costs and further trade and financial liberalization, along with more stringent intellectual property regimes, has favoured the emergence of global value chains (GVCs). Participating in GVCs has been viewed as a driver of economic growth, offering firms opportunities for learning and upgrading. Yet a country\u2019s benefits from GVCs may be limited if these only offer a country low value added activities that do not encourage skill-building or moving up the value chain (Pietrobelli, 2021; UNCTAD, 2013). Moreover, the low-cost labour comparative advantages of low-income economies has been undermined by capital-based technological change (Rodrik, 2016). In addition, the increasing globalization of the world economy and the diffusion of ICTs have swung the balance toward knowledge economies \u2013 based less on physical capital and more on intangible capital (Foray, 2004).3 Innovation and value creation have increasingly been taking place in the knowledge-intensive service sectors. Since the 1970s, this has been accompanied by a rise in the share of service exports (figure IV.3). In recent years, the rapid diffusion of the Internet and ICTs has fuelled the emergence of digital platforms and the transition to digital economies based on the dematerialization of production and data monetization (UNCTAD, 2019).

Moreover, in most advanced economies, there has been a general increase in R&D expenditure as a percentage of GDP. This has been largely driven by the private sector, but some countries have also greatly expanded public R&D allocations, such as China (Filippetti and Vezzani, 2022). In most developing countries, however, R&D figures remain too low.

These stem from two key sources of uncertainty, namely, one related to the results of R&D and one related to the diffusion and socioeconomic impact of new technologies (box IV.2). Given the uncertain outcomes and long-term horizons at the technological frontier, Governments need to learn partly by trial and error. Box IV.2 Key issues for policies at the technological frontier Uncertainty and cumulativeness R&D and frontier technology development are highly uncertain and long-term endeavours. Transforming scientific knowledge into innovative products and services is expensive and risky, often leading to failure. At the early stages, frontier technologies can involve multiple technical solutions and business models, of which only a few survive. Moreover, science and technology are complex and cumulative, so staying ahead requires continuous investment. Leading technological firms rely heavily on their R&D but also on skilled actors outside their boundaries. The timing dilemma Governments may wish to support emerging technologies with public goods, but this involves difficult choices. It may be easier and cheaper to intervene early, but at this stage, the best bets might not yet be evident and the need to intervene might not be apparent. However, by the time dominant technologies have emerged and diffused in the economy, the corrections needed may be more costly and require more time to enact. Governments therefore need an anticipatory approach to policies at the technological frontier that balances uncertainty and costs and relies on strategic planning.

Innovation is, however, predominantly performed by firms, and is related to production processes, new goods and services, marketing strategies and overall business models. However, firms do not operate in silos, and their innovative capacities also rely on their industrial and institutional contexts (Morrison et al., 2008). Project grants to fund basic research are often provided through higher education or research institutions. Grants for business R&D and innovation are usually for particular challenges or to help the outputs of science and new technologies become marketable products. Both are typically provided through competitive processes that favour the emergence of new ideas and strengthen a country\u2019s innovation potential. Interactions between academia, research institutes, industry and Government lead to policy actions that are better tailored to the needs and potential of the innovation ecosystem. With regard to meeting societal needs, the engagement of civil society helps direct technology and innovation, and can point out potential unintended consequences. D. Policies for AI AI technology has been theorized and developed since the middle of the last century, but has only recently entered everyday life and the policy realm (Haenlein and Kaplan, 2019). In 2017, Canada became the first country to officially issue a national AI strategy. Since then, AI has attracted significant attention from policymakers, with at least 1,900 new policy instruments (OECD, 2024a), and 89 national strategies (Maslej et al., 2024). Despite this rapid rise, AI policy is still a relatively new field of action, with profound uncertainties about what is needed and what works and what does not. With the integration of AI into an increasing number of activities (see chapter II), Governments need to respond as a matter of both public concern and economic development. Increasing public awareness and concern about issues such as labour protection, human rights, unethical use, personal autonomy, data privacy and bias and discrimination have amplified attention paid to AI. While uncertainty and risks of failure are significant, inaction could result in even greater costs. Traditional policy and regulatory models struggle to match the speed, autonomy and opacity of AI systems, posing challenges for Governments, businesses and the international community (United Nations, AI Advisory Body, 2024). Policies for frontier technologies and AI need to be flexible and regularly updated (UNCTAD, 2023). To date, most AI policies have been produced by developed countries. At the end of 2023, about two thirds of developed countries had a national AI strategy. Only 6 of the 89 national AI strategies were from LDCs (figure IV.5). Bangladesh and Sierra Leone took the lead in 2019 and were joined by four other LDCs in 2023, an uptick that may signal the beginning of greater LDCs participation in AI policymaking discourse, although these six countries form only around one eighth of LDCs. LDCs and developing countries need to move quickly to align AI adoption and development with their national development goals and agendas. Following the path set by others may not fulfil their needs and priorities. Directing frontier technologies requires an anticipatory approach Policies for AI and frontier technologies need to be flexible and regularly updated 122 Figure IV.6 shows the most common policy instruments. More than one third are related to national strategies and agendas, AI- related regulations or public consultations. This includes gathering information on technological trajectories, addressing social concerns and anticipating possible opportunities and downsides. Although around one third of developing countries have strategies and plans, these may not go beyond the declarative stage if they are not complemented by sufficient resources and instruments for implementation. Policy instruments also support early- stage science and technology efforts, including networking and collaboration, public awareness campaigns and outreach activities to engage civil society. It is important to connect diverse actors in the AI innovation ecosystem, enabling idea exchanges, resource-sharing and collaboration, in order to identify gaps, promote best practices, prevent duplication and ensure efficient resource use. To support the development and diffusion of AI, developed countries are more likely to use financial instruments, such as competitive grants for public research and for business R&D and innovation, as well as student fellowships, along with policies to support the developme",

It is important to connect diverse actors in the AI innovation ecosystem, enabling idea exchanges, resource-sharing and collaboration, in order to identify gaps, promote best practices, prevent duplication and ensure efficient resource use. To support the development and diffusion of AI, developed countries are more likely to use financial instruments, such as competitive grants for public research and for business R&D and innovation, as well as student fellowships, along with policies to support the development and uptake of AI through computing and research infrastructures. A greater proportion of instruments directly funding STI and AI infrastructure can be related to the larger budgets dedicated to R&D in developed countries. In contrast, developing countries are more likely to target the use of AI in the public sector. Incorporating AI into e-government practices can expedite government processes, help overcome limited resources or bureaucratic backlogs and help learn about AI through its use (United Nations, 2022). However, this should not be at the cost of direct and practical interventions to support STI related to AI and create a supportive environment for business innovation that turns declarations into reality. Figure IV.5 Most AI policies have been produced by developed countries (Proportion of countries with a national AI strategy, by country grouping; percentage) Source: UNCTAD calculation based on Maslej et al., 2024. 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Developing excluding LDCs Developed LDCs Developed countries focus more on support for AI research, computing and related infrastructures 123 Chapter IV Designing national policies for AI Figure IV.6 National strategies, agendas and plans are the most common AI policy instrument (Most-used AI policy instruments, developed and developing countries; percentage) Source: UNCTAD calculations, based on data from the OECD AI Policy Observatory.

In figure IV.6, this is reflected in the number of instruments targeting networking and collaborative platforms or public awareness campaigns to reach civil society. These platforms can also help address gaps in the AI ecosystem, helping to share best practices and reduce the duplication of efforts. Typically, the countries more prepared for AI governance are developed countries with higher per capita GDP (figure IV.7). Readiness rises with GDP per capita and less advanced countries are in general unprepared to capitalize on AI opportunities and deal with risks, leaving them exposed to technological paths and regulations set by others. However, some countries at the same levels of income are achieving more. For example, Rwanda, which issued a national AI strategy in 2023, has a much higher AI governance score than other countries with similar GDP per capita. Other \u201coverperforming\u201d developing countries include Brazil, China, India and Singapore, which have policies and strategies that could offer useful lessons for other countries. Policies for adopting and developing AI Adopting \u2013 Policies targeting AI adoption should support the uptake and diffusion of AI products and solutions in the economy and provide upskilling and reskilling training to the workforce exposed to AI.

While developing countries may prefer to initially grasp only the low-hanging fruit of AI adoption, this could limit their capacity to catch up. In the long term, their opportunities for learning through imitation are likely to be hindered by the rapid evolution of technology. Developing \u2013 Policies targeting AI development should expand the capabilities required to generate new knowledge, and create new prototypes, systems and applications. These could include networking and distributing computing power across a country. Developed countries have done so in order to keep pushing the technological frontiers. The two approaches are not, however, mutually exclusive and countries need to strike a balance between them. Developing countries may find it less challenging to support adoption by responding to particular sectoral needs, while taking a targeted approach to trigger positive dynamics and improved innovative capabilities. Yet they also need to make long-term strategic plans to support AI development; otherwise, as latecomers, they may end up with few options. E. Case studies of AI-related policies This section discusses overarching approaches and strategies of the three main global markets: China, the European Union and the United States, then presents instruments that address bottlenecks at the three leverage points of infrastructure, data and skills (table IV.2). AI policies should strategically target both adoption and development Table IV.2 Examples of AI policies for adoption and development Source: UNCTAD.

One option, as favoured in China, is direct intervention in support of national political goals using strict regulations. A second, as in the European Union, is strong regulations aimed at protecting fundamental rights and values. A third approach, favoured in the United States, involves a light regulatory framework. Recently, the development of AI and its wide-ranging societal and economic effects have influenced country strategies, with emerging similarities in approaches. The first step of a national AI strategy is to identify and address coordination failures and weaknesses in the innovation system. Governments can, for example, support applied research through project grants for AI-related business activities.",

Recently, the development of AI and its wide-ranging societal and economic effects have influenced country strategies, with emerging similarities in approaches. The first step of a national AI strategy is to identify and address coordination failures and weaknesses in the innovation system. Governments can, for example, support applied research through project grants for AI-related business activities. Pilot AI use cases in particular sectors and knowledge and technology transfer mechanisms can contribute to accelerate the adoption of AI. Countries can consider a multistep approach, as in China, first incentivizing the private sector to adopt, adapt and develop AI, and subsequently supervising and regulating the AI industry. Governments need to promote good practices and enforce rules and standards, while revising regulations and policies to adapt to changing circumstances.5 For example, the European Union provides a coherent framework integrating new legislation as it emerges, to address issues such as consumer protection, and regulating platforms to counterbalance concentration and ensure data protection. Policy formulation and implementation are interactive and iterative processes that require continuous evaluation, and expectations need to be aligned with feasibility. 5 For example, Brazil required Meta to suspend a new privacy policy that authorized the use of personal data to train AI systems since it was in violation of the General Data Protection Law (Brazil, National Data Protection Authority, 2024). Failures should be accepted, as they are with regard to new ventures in the private sector, but evaluation mechanisms should be put in place to improve design and implementation (Rodrik, 2004). Currently, only about 10 per cent of the AI policies surveyed by OECD have been evaluated, based on data from the AI Policy Observatory. China The Government of China has taken an increasingly active role in AI. In 2017, it set out a long-term strategic plan to transform China by 2030 from an AI contributor to a primary AI innovator (China, Ministry of Science and Technology, 2017). The plan is: \u2022 Technology-led \u2013 deploying forward- looking R&D in key frontier domains and achieving transformational and disruptive breakthroughs. \u2022 Systemic \u2013 formulating targeted strategies for different technologies and industries. \u2022 Market-oriented \u2013 fostering commercialization of AI and creating competitive advantages in related technologies. \u2022 Open \u2013 advocating open-source approaches to enable industry, academia and research collaborations. China is now formulating industry standards and expanding regulatory oversight, and has recently moved to a more direct supervision of AI, introducing some of the world\u2019s first binding national regulations, defining requirements for how algorithms are built and deployed and establishing the information that developers must disclose to the Government and the public. In 2023, the Cyberspace Administration introduced Interim Measures for the Administration of Generative Artificial Intelligence Services, for regulating research, development and the use of GenAI (Cyberspace Administration of China, 2023). National AI strategies address coordination failures and weaknesses in the innovation system China set a long-term plan, then gradually introduced regulations matching AI evolution 127 Chapter IV Designing national policies for AI The measures impose various obligations on GenAI providers to ensure that models, contents and services comply with national requirements and uphold \u201ccore socialist values\u201d and national security. They also aim to ensure the transparency of GenAI services and the accuracy and reliability of generated content, to prevent discrimination and respect intellectual property and individual rights. In this last aspect, the measures echo earlier provisions targeting deepfakes and fake news. In 2024, the Government launched a National Data Bureau to coordinate and support the development of foundational data systems, and to integrate, share, develop and apply data resources. China relies on a series of technical and administrative tools, such as disclosure requirements, model auditing mechanisms and technical performance standards, as well as measures to ensure that public bodies are responsive to technological development. Focusing on particular emerging issues and technologies reduces the burden of generalization but demands a high level of responsiveness to technological advances and strong coordination among public bodies.",

Focusing on particular emerging issues and technologies reduces the burden of generalization but demands a high level of responsiveness to technological advances and strong coordination among public bodies. European Union In 2024, the European Union passed the AI Act, which defines rules according to the associated level of risk, namely, unacceptable, high, limited or minimal (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2024; O\u2019Shaughnessy and Sheehan, 2023). Most applications, such as video games or spam filters, fall in the minimal risk category, and companies are only advised to adopt voluntary codes of conduct. The Act allows high-risk AI systems but says that these should include complete, clear and accessible instructions, which should be stored in an open database maintained by the European Commission in collaboration with member states. The Act bans uses that present unacceptable risks, such as cognitive behavioural manipulation, social scoring, biometric identification and categorization, as well as remote biometric identification systems such as facial recognition. This is known as a risk-based approach. The AI Act builds on previous legislation such as the General Data Protection Regulation of 2016, which guarantees privacy and respect for human rights (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016). The Digital Service Act of 2022 is aimed at establishing a level playing field, to promote innovation and competitiveness in information services, from websites to digital platforms, and stop large providers from imposing unfair conditions that damage other businesses or limit consumer choice. The European Union has also revised its industrial strategy to address external dependences on critical technologies. Strategic areas related to the AI value chain are critical raw materials, semiconductors, quantum technologies and cloud computing. In these areas, the European Union is building industrial, research and trade policies, fostering co-investment across member states and bringing together stakeholders in industrial alliances (European Commission, 2021). In 2023, to strengthen competitiveness and resilience in semiconductor technologies and applications, the European Union passed the European Chips Act, aiming to mobilize more than \u20ac43 billion of public and private investments and setting out measures to prepare for, anticipate and respond to possible supply chain disruptions, while strengthening its technological leadership. The European Union has also allocated funds for AI research and innovation. The European Research Executive Agency manages more than 1,000 research projects, with pioneering projects in AI and quantum technologies (European Commission, 2024). The European Union is coupling its regulatory approach with stronger support for industry and research 128 United States In 2022, the United States Congress passed the CHIPS [Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors] and Science Act to boost scientific research and advanced semiconductor manufacturing capacity. The act was motivated by increasing dependency in chips manufacturing and the fact that federal R&D spending had neared its lowest point in 60 years,6 and targets frontier technologies, including AI. Of the $250 billion budgeted, 80 per cent are allocated to research activities and the rest to tax credits for chip manufacturers. The Act exemplifies key aspects of policies for emerging technologies. It adopts an anticipatory approach, supporting technologies that could shape future industries. It addresses coordination failures, and leverages complementarities through a supply chain approach, supporting activities from hardware production to computing infrastructure, research, and skill development. New talent will be trained through a national network for microelectronics education, as well as cybersecurity workforce development programmes. To retain talent, an AI scholarship programme has been set up for students who committed to a period of government service. The Act also promotes safe and trustworthy AI systems and the collection of best practices for artificial intelligence and data science. Finally, it envisages public\u2013private partnerships that would establish virtual testbeds to examine potential vulnerabilities to failure, malfunction or cyberattack (Zhang et al., 2022).",

The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights noted that AI and automated decision systems should not advance at the cost of civil rights, democratic values or foundational 6 The share of imported microchips in the United States increased from 63 per cent in the 1990s to about 88 per cent in 2021; in the same period, with respect to R&D as a share of GDP, the United States fell from the fourth position globally to the ninth (United States, Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, 2022). American principles, and set out principles to guide the design, use and deployment of automated systems to protect the public (United States, 2022). Action is also being taken by individual states. In California, for example, an AI bill in 2024, required firms to commit to model testing and the disclosure of safety protocols and made compulsory a series of requirements that were previously only voluntary. This could represent a major shift in the way emerging and potentially disruptive technologies are dealt with in the United States (The Guardian, 2024; The Washington Post, 2024). Figure IV.8 summarizes the main elements of AI policies deployed by China, the European Union and the United States. All are taking a cautious approach to regulating AI development, alongside substantial public investments across the AI supply chain, from semiconductors to data centres, and in research and development, to foster the emergence of new industries. Moreover, they aim for the inclusive integration of AI into both economies and societies, to benefit a wide range of stakeholders. These commonalities highlight key elements to consider in both national and global AI policy strategies. AI policies in major economies can create significant spillover effects, shaping the policy choices of other countries. As leading countries set higher benchmarks, particularly in boosting competition and prioritizing R&D, not all countries are equally positioned to keep up. Many may struggle to match increasing R&D budgets, and the focus on future technologies can deepen disparities, widening the gaps between advanced economies and those working to catch up. This highlights the challenges faced by smaller or less advanced countries in keeping pace with global innovation leaders. The United States CHIPS and Science Act exemplifies key aspects of policies for emerging technologies AI policies of major economies influence policy options for others and could hinder catch-up efforts 129 Chapter IV Designing national policies for AI Strengthening infrastructure to power AI AI infrastructure can be classified under the two broad categories of digital connectivity and computing power. Relatively few policies aiming at improving digital infrastructure can be deemed AI-specific and, particularly when targeting connectivity, are often within the portfolio of the ministry of telecommunications or of infrastructure. Gaps in digital infrastructure and inclusion are likely to be replicated in AI uptake (Bentley et al., 2024). Developing countries that lack universal digital access need to install and enhance national ICT and energy infrastructure and establish new forms of connectivity to reach underserved areas. Working directly with communities, industrial representatives and individuals can help pinpoint specific business or geographical issues and the need for partnerships with private actors. Improvements in wireless technologies and devices can facilitate small-scale AI adoption, but scaling up is much more demanding. Without adequate computing power and digital skills, connectivity alone risks turning an economy into a data exporter and missing opportunities to generate local benefits. The rise of cloud computing is a response to the increasing dependence of AI on data and computing power. When enhancing infrastructure systems, countries should prioritize connectivity, interoperability and standardization across systems, sectors, actors, users and providers, including across regional and national boundaries (table IV.3). Gaps in digital connectivity and computing power can lead to unequal distribution of AI benefits across places Figure IV.8 Overarching policy approaches of China, the European Union and the United States Source: UNCTAD.",

This connectivity upgrade is aimed at reaching all public schools and healthcare units, contributing to the modernization of the public sector (Brazil, Federal Government, 2024). C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire \u2013 Targeted infrastructure can support the adoption of AI in particular sectors. For example, the e-Agriculture project is aimed at increasing the use of digital technologies and improving farm productivity and access to markets. This is being pursued by improving Internet coverage and adoption, fostering the use of large-scale digital platforms, rehabilitating rural access roads and adopting sustainable digital services to diffuse e-agriculture. Focusing on both physical infrastructure and digital services, the project represents a value-chain approach that can respond to community needs (World Bank, 2024). Japan \u2013 The High Performance Computing Infrastructure project strengthens national computing capacity for AI development. The project uses an existing supercomputer and connects major universities and national laboratories via a high-speed network (Research Organization for Information Science and Technology, 2024). By decentralizing access and networking institutions the project increases computing power availability and supports innovation in computing-intense sectors, increasing the number of new actors in the AI ecosystem. Decentralized organizational systems and distributed networks are crucial aspects of the digital revolution and a cornerstone of advanced AI ecosystems.

The policy supports the development and production of essential hardware components of the AI value chain by streamlining regulation and standardization in the field of microchips, to provide a common and clear playing field for business development. Building data for responsible AI Data is a key production factor in the knowledge economy. Many countries already had data policies in place before the advent of AI, but will need to update them, while others still lack national data frameworks. Data policies should ensure that databases are interoperable and available across the economy, with privacy protection for both inputs and outputs, relying on consent and taking account of possible biases (UNCTAD, 2024c). AI systems add concerns related to ownership, while also raising questions of intellectual property or fairness and accountability when generating data and decisions. Supporting AI development may require rethinking intellectual property provisions and creating mechanisms to facilitate public\u2013private collaboration. Such efforts should promote AI innovation while safeguarding human rights and addressing potential vulnerabilities and malfunctions. Policies should also respond to the international and transboundary nature of AI. Using cloud computing available from international markets can reduce costs, but it is important to avoid increasing data and information dependency and stifling the future development of a domestic service market. 7 Open data refers to data that is openly accessible, exploitable, editable and shared by anyone for any purpose. 8 An open-data hub integrates disparate data into a single new system homogenizing data and thereby guaranteeing compatibility, to allow for real-time processing from different entry points. A hub can also integrate tools with which to process data or develop applications; for example, the GitHub open data hub provides open-source AI tools for running large and distributed AI workloads. Countries need to consider all levels of the data value chain. Policies should clearly define which types of data can be made publicly available, and how they should be handled, and favour standards for data and metadata. Countries can also collect and provide open data,7 either through AI-specific programmes or through open-data initiatives and hubs, to streamline data integration, storage, access and collaboration.8 This could improve transparency, promote innovation and encourage public engagement in the adoption and development of AI. Governments can also rely on industrial players to leverage existing strengths by supporting platforms for data exchange and aggregation and for data monetization and the development of AI for particular uses. Different types of data have their own requirements. In particular, for data on humans, or AI applications making decisions for humans, there should be higher standards for privacy and responsibility, and accountability in case of errors. Policies and standards can be developed through public consultations and open forums, to incorporate the views and concerns of different stakeholders, increase accountability and transparency and foster trust (table IV.4). Data can have broad social value because they are non-rival, namely, the use of a data set does not preclude its availability for other uses. However, the strong market power of large digital corporations may limit the capacity of developing countries to maximize benefits (UNCTAD, 2021). UNCTAD, in a recent study, analysed the relationships between data and sustainable development (UNCTAD, 2024d). Chapter V discusses the implications and challenges for data at the international level. Countries can support open data to facilitate access, data integration and collaboration 132 Table IV.",

Chile \u2013 The Ministry of Science, Technology, Knowledge and Innovation, and the Ministry of Economy, Development and Tourism have set up the Data Observatory (Data Observatory, 2024), a public\u2013private\u2013 academia collaboration that seeks to maximize the benefits from data for science, research and productive development. As a multi-stakeholder organization, the Observatory leverages the competences and resources of a variety of actors for developing STI and data-based services and analyses in different fields, from natural science to urban planning. It uses open-data platforms that facilitate the participation of small providers and supports projects and initiatives related to data analysis for social impact. Germany \u2013 The Federal Ministry of Digital Affairs and Transport has launched Mobility Data Space, which brings together automobile companies, organizations and institutions that wish to monetize their data, seek data exchanges that bring mutual benefits or need data for innovative AI mobility solutions (Mobility Data Space, 2024). A market-based platform, it incentivizes participation by offering the potential for financial remuneration \u2013 representing a model that leverages existing industrial strengths to support the diffusion of AI (for a presentation on the rationales and design principles, see acatech, 2024). India \u2013 The Council of Medical Research has issued Ethical Guidelines for Application of Artificial Intelligence in Biomedical Research and Healthcare, to direct AI adoption and development involving humans or their data (INDIAai, 2023). These recognize the importance of processes for safety and minimizing risk to prevent unintended or deliberate misuses that can harm patients. Data sets used by AI should avoid biases by adequately representing the population and guaranteeing the highest privacy and security standards for patient data.

This is an experimental space where AI companies can collaborate on solutions that respect personal information and rights, by design and in compliance with national data- processing regulations. The Authority accompanies the process and gathers information about possible regulatory adaptations, to keep pace with technological advances, thereby also making the sandbox a tool for policy learning. Singapore \u2013 In the Copyright Act 2021, Singapore redesigned the copyright regime to take account of how copyrighted works are created, distributed, accessed and used (Singapore, The law revision commission, 2021).

The Act is aimed at making available large and diverse data sets for algorithmic training. The Act introduces an exception to the current regime that permits the copying of copyrighted works for the purpose of computational data analysis such as text and data mining and the training of machine-learning algorithms. It also introduces conditions and safeguards to protect the commercial interests of copyright owners (Singapore, Intellectual Property Office, 2022). Reskilling and upskilling for AI AI has the potential to transform many industries in the near future, reshaping labour markets, altering tasks and changing required skill sets. Demand is increasing for skilled workers who can adopt and develop AI, including technical expertise in data science and AI skills for particular business operations. Countries need population-wide digital literacy, to ensure that everyone can take advantage of AI for work and personal life, and to have highly trained individuals who can develop AI systems and adapt them to particular needs. This should start with the inclusion of STEM and AI subjects at multiple levels within the national education system, from early education to adult learning. Introducing foundational data science and AI-related subjects in the early phases of education can help develop technology-savvy generations ready for AI-based businesses. Governments can also introduce or encourage programmes for retraining upskilled or displaced workers, with particular attention paid to women, who are underrepresented in both STEM and AI (Green and Lamby, 2023), and to older workers with low levels of digital skills, who are less likely to engage in such training (OECD, 2023). Policymakers can address concerns about diversity and inclusivity by empowering all demographic groups with the necessary skill sets to benefit or contribute to AI. By partnering with private institutions, Governments can also target particular sectors or industries. Philippines \u2013 In 2023, the National Economic and Development Authority published the Digital Workforce Competitiveness Act. The legislation puts human development at the forefront, aiming for equitable access and the provision of digital skills and competences that meet global quality standards to accelerate innovation and entrepreneurship. The Act targets particular digital skills, such as data analytics and AI or engineering and cloud computing, through upskilling, reskilling and training programmes, offering a variety of incentives to foster digital careers (Philippines, National Economic and Development Authority, 2023). The Act takes an anticipatory approach, envisaging the mapping of digital skills and technologies as the basis for formulating a road map that considers the evolution of jobs and skills. It also establishes an inter-agency council, including different state departments and agencies, which raises awareness about digital upskilling opportunities and coordinates actions, leverages complementarities, rationalizes policy interventions and provides a single-entry point for training, certification and scholarships. 134 Spain \u2013 The National Plan for Digital Skills provides a list of actions and objectives to address gender bias in digital technologies (Spain, Ministry for Economic Affairs and Digital Transformation, 2021) and to increase the readiness of girls and women for AI (J\u0101kobsone, 2021; La Moncloa, 2021). To direct girls toward these disciplines, it introduces STEM subjects in primary education and includes programmes aimed at orienting women towards digital professions. The plan involves an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of, opportunities for and threats to women\u2019s participation in digital and technology careers (Spain, Government, 2021). Ghana \u2013 To enable the younger generation to keep pace with a continuously evolving field, the Government has introduced coding and programming to the national education system and begun to train educators in how to teach them (Ghana, Ministry of Education, 2021). Moreover, subjects go beyond coding skills, to cover the fundamentals of how AI works, and concepts related to human, animal, robot and artificial intelligences, as well as weak and strong AI.",

The first phase of the programme is aimed at training 30,000 students and will then be scaled up. (Nigeria, National Information Technology Development Agency, 2024). The scheme provides scholarships to develop skills related to the digital economy, such as data science, AI and cloud computing. By fostering partnerships between high- skill AI researchers and businesses, the scheme is part of a broader strategy to build the workforce of the future.9 F. A whole-of-government approach to AI policy The resurgence of industrial and STI policies, coupled with the rapid advancement of AI, has placed AI policies at the forefront of policymaking. AI policies are crucial in driving structural transformation, boosting productivity and tackling social, ethical and environmental challenges. As the global economy transits towards services and digitalization, Governments should adapt industrial and STI policies, to support the adoption and development of new technologies, as well as the dissemination and absorption of knowledge. Adapting to changing global conditions and harnessing frontier technologies requires swift and purpose-driven policy interventions. However, setting AI policies is not easy. When Governments need to provide public goods for these technologies, they have broad decision- making authority, but this is tempered by uncertainty regarding the trajectories and outcomes of policy decisions. Nevertheless, an anticipatory approach can help avoid the need to make corrections after most opportunities have passed. The unique characteristics of data- driven AI highlight the need for policy changes, with robust data governance, including regulations and standards for data-sharing and privacy protection. Additionally, the ability of AI to generate new data and concerns about deepfakes and misinformation require frameworks that regulate AI not only as a product but also within decision-making processes, ensuring transparency, explainability, ethics and accounta",

Additionally, the ability of AI to generate new data and concerns about deepfakes and misinformation require frameworks that regulate AI not only as a product but also within decision-making processes, ensuring transparency, explainability, ethics and accountability. However, considering the high level of concentration of AI markets, enforcement and regulation can be challenging for smaller economies. In this respect, chapter V discusses AI policy efforts at the international level, offering suggestions of how the international community can support inclusive AI development that benefits all. AI is a pervasive technology that requires a whole-of-government approach, to align AI strategies with policies across sectors, including industry, education, infrastructure and trade. Doing so requires enhanced coordination, to leverage synergies among action plans. AI policies should go beyond incentives such as tax deductions, and incorporate regulation, governance and enforcement, to direct technological change and provide collective solutions to the major challenges of this century. Collaboration among stakeholders is essential to maximize societal benefits. To ensure effective adoption and development, successful AI strategies should also focus on the key leverage points of infrastructure, data and skills. Governments must adapt policies to support new technologies and the dissemination of knowledge 136 Annex IV 10 For information on the data and methodology, see https://www.globaltradealert.org/data_extraction.

Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence, Stanford University, United States. 141 Chapter V Global collaboration for inclusive and equitable AI International AI governance initiatives are highly fragmented and dominated by developed countries. AI technology is largely controlled by a few technology giants, which are likely to prioritize profits over societal benefits, and it can be deployed virtually anywhere, extending its influence beyond borders. Therefore, Governments should act to establish international guidance on AI development that favours public interest and promotes AI as a public good. Most developing countries have significant stakes in the future of AI but have limited influence over the direction it takes, which may result in a failure of global AI governance. This requires multi-stakeholder cooperation to make AI accessible and beneficial for everyone and foster inclusive innovation in tackling global challenges. A comprehensive global framework for AI should incorporate accountability mechanisms for companies, Governments and institutions.

One possible model is the environmental, social and governance (ESG) framework. An AI equivalent could involve impact assessments throughout the AI life cycle and detailed explanations by developers of how AI systems function. Once shared standards have been established, certification could shift from voluntary to mandatory reporting, supported by measures to oversee compliance. Shared digital public infrastructure \u2013 A global shared facility, for example following the CERN model, can provide equitable access to AI infrastructure. Governments can also collaborate with the private sector through public\u2013private partnerships to expedite the development of digital public infrastructure (DPI) for AI in local innovation ecosystems. Tailored DPI systems can offer essential resources and services to support AI adoption and development. Open innovation \u2013 Open innovation models, such as open data and open source, can democratize knowledge and resources to foster inclusive AI innovation. The international community can benefit from coordinating and harmonizing the valuable but fragmented open-source AI resources worldwide. Connected and interoperable repositories with common standards can enhance the global knowledge base and improve access through trusted hubs that ensure quality and security. A global hub \u2013 An AI-focused centre and network modelled, for example, on the United Nations Climate Technology Centre and Network, can function as a global hub for building AI capacity, facilitating technology transfer and coordinating technical assistance to developing countries. South\u2013South collaboration \u2013 Strengthening South\u2013 South cooperation in science and technology, through building regional innovation hubs and expert networks, can contribute to enhancing the capacity of developing countries to address common AI challenges. Provisions for AI technology and services could be included in existing trade agreements, while regional institutions can assist in sharing best practices and developing coherent AI policies. 144 A. The need for global AI governance Many AI-related issues can be addressed at the national level through well-designed policies. However, as AI encompasses intangible goods and services that can be replicated and deployed virtually anywhere, its influence extends beyond borders, necessitating international collaboration. Ensuring AI as a public good requires a collective multi-stakeholder effort to make it accessible, equitable and beneficial for all, driving inclusive innovation to tackle global challenges. AI is set to change the technological, economic and social landscape, presenting new opportunities and risks while requiring stronger global collaboration, including the following: \u2022 Reshaped economic opportunities \u2013 AI shifts innovation and value creation towards knowledge-intensive sectors, reshaping economic opportunities and power relationships in a multipolar world. It is also transforming traditional sectors and businesses, leading to greater servicification across economies. This can energize economic activities and open new opportunities, but it can also displace workers and undermine the comparative advantage of developing countries in low-cost labour. \u2022 Dominant companies \u2013 AI development and deployment are led by a handful of large multinational companies. Private enterprises are driven by profit motives for shareholders, but their decisions can affect the whole of society. Larger countries can seek to regulate these companies but smaller countries, particularly less developed ones, may lack institutional capacity and economic strength. They may, therefore, be subject to decisions made elsewhere unless consistent international cooperation and common principles on AI are established. \u2022 Rapid diffusion \u2013 New foundation models and AI applications can be diffused virtually everywhere in a short period of time. They can therefore impact economies and business worldwide before policymakers become aware of their existence. For example, Facebook took about 10 months to reach 1 million users and the platform known at the time as Twitter, about two years; in contrast, ChatGPT reached 100 million users in only two months (Hu, 2023). Such rapid diffusion requires international coordination in regulation and monitoring, aiming for broader societal goals that benefit the global community (Cihon, 2019).",

Such rapid diffusion requires international coordination in regulation and monitoring, aiming for broader societal goals that benefit the global community (Cihon, 2019). \u2022 Slow regulatory adaptation \u2013 Technological advances often outstrip the pace at which current regulatory frameworks can adapt, particularly in countries with lower levels of development. This means that hundreds of millions of people in developing countries cannot influence the direction of technological change but are nevertheless exposed to possible negative consequences. This includes different types of bias, as AI technologies trained on skewed or discriminatory data are likely to ignore particular social, economic, environmental and cultural contexts, with the risk of deepening existing data divides (UNCTAD, 2024a). Regulatory mechanisms that differ from one country to another may result in inconsistent or contradictory impacts across countries, sectors or parts of society, distributing benefits and costs in an uneven and unfair manner. AI can be replicated and deployed virtually anywhere, extending its influence beyond borders 145 Chapter V Global collaboration for inclusive and equitable AI \u2022 Cross-border flows of data and skills \u2013 AI applications are spread across digital infrastructures and rely on digital skills and vast amounts of data that flow through international hubs. Cross- border flows are growing rapidly in digital trade, international commerce and Internet platforms and services. This digital economy shows increasing returns to scale, which can trigger a self-reinforcing dynamic whereby more data translates into value that in turn enables the collection of even more data (UNCTAD, 2024a). Moreover, certain categories of workers are increasingly able to participate in the global labour market either through online freelance and virtual work or by relocating to countries with more or better job opportunities. Such labour flows are typically from developing to developed countries. B. Aligning AI with social objectives The dominance of multinational tech giants Technology leadership by the private sector is not new. What is new to AI is the unprecedented level of control and understanding that private companies have over the technology, an imbalance that limits the ability of Governments to steer AI development in the public interest. The current AI boom relies on decades of academic work, such as in machine learning and natural-language processing, but most of the latest cutting-edge and high-profile research is carried out by private companies and is not published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. In 2023, researchers in corporations contributed only 3.8 per cent of AI-related academic papers. Most knowledge is being created behind closed doors, limiting the potential for learning and idea spillovers (Owens, 2024; Oxfam International, 2024). The dominance of multinational technology corporations in AI is pronounced and can be considered an oligopoly due to their market power. For example, Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft control over two thirds of the global cloud market through their computing services and storage capacities (Lynn et al., 2023). For the graphics processing units that are critical for large-scale computation, there is a virtual monopoly, with Nvidia having a 90 per cent market share in the third quarter of 2024 (Jon Peddie Research, 2024). Private companies correspondingly dominate investment in AI. In 2021, the industry worldwide spent over $340 billion, compared with $1.5 billion spent by United States Government agencies (excluding the Department of Defense) and $1.1 billion spent by the European Commission (Owens, 2024; UNCTAD, 2021a). The Government of China has increased support to AI-related firms through various State-backed initiatives that have amounted to $210 billion over the past decade (Beraja et al., 2024). In general, private companies have the resources to attract and retain high-skill employees. Between 2004 and 2020, the proportion of graduates from universities in North America with PhDs in AI-related fields working in the industry increased from 21 to 70 per cent (Ahmed et al., 2023). Multinational technology corporations also draw talent and resources from domestic firms, which can hamper knowledge spillovers within economies (Holm et al., 2020). The dominance of a few private companies in AI is creating new security risks.",

Between 2004 and 2020, the proportion of graduates from universities in North America with PhDs in AI-related fields working in the industry increased from 21 to 70 per cent (Ahmed et al., 2023). Multinational technology corporations also draw talent and resources from domestic firms, which can hamper knowledge spillovers within economies (Holm et al., 2020). The dominance of a few private companies in AI is creating new security risks. One programming error can have rapidly diffused effects around the world. Recent advances in AI are dominated by multinational technology corporations An AI oligopoly could create vulnerabilities for countries 146 For example, in July 2024, a faulty update of security software distributed by CrowdStrike crashed about 8.5 million Microsoft-operated systems, causing widespread global disruptions, and affecting business operations, as well as public and critical infrastructure (Oldager, 2024; Philstar, 2024; Weston, 2024). Without external oversight, businesses are unlikely to prioritize ethics and societal impacts in their development processes or address potential issues such as biases or misinformation, on the grounds that this might make them less competitive, with lower returns for investors. Even AI projects aimed at social impact may feel the pressures of the profit motive and capital markets. OpenAI, for example, was initially founded as a non-profit organization, but to secure the necessary capital it later established a for-profit subsidiary. At the time of writing, to make the company more attractive to investors, OpenAI is planning to restructure its core business into a for-profit benefit corporation that will no longer be controlled by its non-profit board (Hu and Cai, 2024). Under the pressure of substantial profit- related incentives, self-regulation is likely to be ineffective. Rather than influence from public policy, control is often in the opposite direction, with companies putting pressure on Governments. Many technology companies have been influencing regulations and public policies (UNCTAD, 2021b). Moreover, while they may have an incentive to collaborate with Governments in large markets, they have less need to establish mutually beneficial relationships with smaller countries. In response to the increasing concerns about market dominance that can stifle competition, a number of jurisdictions have opened antitrust investigations, for example, Germany, India, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union (Chu, 2022; Gil, 2023; Milmo, 2024; Kim and Kim, 2024; The Yomiuri Shimbun, 2024; White, 2024). The importance of a multi- stakeholder approach If AI governance is to align the incentives of the private sector with societal development goals and the public interest, it should take a multi-stakeholder approach. The technology needs to be fair, namely, findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (GO FAIR, 2016). It also needs to be care, namely, with collective benefits, authority to control, responsibility and ethics, and to prioritize people and purpose (GIDA, 2020). International cooperation can use more accessible open-source technologies not only as cornerstones of science but also to accelerate innovation. Open innovation strengthens international cooperation in science, technology and innovation (STI) and favours knowledge diffusion and the creation of a common pool of capacities that can allow less endowed countries to benefit from AI development. Currently, there are several industry bodies working on guiding and self-regulating the responsible development of AI. For example, the AI Alliance brings together technology developers, researchers, and industry leaders to advance safe and responsible AI rooted in open innovation.

Figure V.1 shows the results from a multi- country survey on how people feel about AI, highlighting concerns about personal data protection and consumer interactions with AI products and services (Ipsos, 2023). Figure V.1 Opinions on AI and personal data (Share of respondents answering NO; percentage) Source: UNCTAD calculations, based on Ipsos, 2023. Note: Excludes countries for which the sample may not reflect the view of the average citizen. Do you know which types of products and services use AI? Do you trust that companies that use AI will protect personal data? India 36 38 Sweden 64 70 United States 68 65 France 68 63 Japan 68 62 Italy 68 50 Canada 66 62 Australia 62 65 Ireland 62 64 Republic of Korea 60 32 Belgium 59 65 New Zealand 58 65 United Kingdom 58 57 Germany 56 61 Argentina 55 56 Netherlands (Kingdom of the) 53 58 Spain 51 54 Poland 45 54 Hungary 40 63 148 The survey shows that most respondents do not believe that companies using AI will protect their privacy. In Canada, France, Italy, Japan, Sweden and the United States, only 3 out of 10 respondents trust companies to make respectful use of their data. In addition, most respondents do not know which types of products and services make use of AI, exposing them to possible misuse. Some companies, for example, created databases by mining social media websites and the Internet for photographs without obtaining permission to index individuals\u2019 faces (Candelon et al., 2022). In developing a set of internationally agreed principles for safeguarding consumer rights, an important reference point is the United Nations guidelines for consumer protection (UNCTAD, 2016). The guidelines can assist countries, particularly those with weaker institutions, in designing protection systems responsive to consumer needs and desires, favouring market differentiation and international cooperation. A key concern related to consumer protection is the GenAI-driven creation of digital replicas, including deepfakes such as recreations of musical performances, impersonations of political and other public figures and the blending of real and artificial images to form disturbing images and explicit content. These pose risks to everyone, spreading misinformation and damaging reputations, and even undermining elections (United Nations, Secretary General, 2023). In a recent report, the United States Copyright Office identified the risks of digital replicas and the problems of privacy violation, unfair competition, consumer protection and potential fraud. Current legislation might not be well designed to address issues related to digital replicas. 1 In their efforts to harmonize and improve the efficiency of patent examination processes worldwide, the main intellectual property offices worldwide established a task force that recognized the need for dedicated guidance on examination practices related to new emerging technologies and AI (see https://www.fiveipoffices.org/ node/9181). 2 The same patent was not granted at the European Patent Office, at the UK Intellectual Property Office and at the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Legislation should protect all individuals independent of their fame or commercial exposure, and tie liability to the making or distribution of unauthorized digital replicas (United States, Copyright Office, 2024). Protecting intellectual property The use of AI is also introducing new uncertainties with regard to the protection of intellectual property. It is not always clear how AI-assisted or AI-generated inventions should be treated under current intellectual property law (Cuntz et al., 2024). In general, AI algorithms themselves cannot be patented unless they take the form of software and only then in a few jurisdictions such as the United States. However, due to the statistical nature of AI, which relies on probabilistic models, the issue of how patents for computer software apply in this case has not yet been settled (WIPO, 2024).",

However, due to the statistical nature of AI, which relies on probabilistic models, the issue of how patents for computer software apply in this case has not yet been settled (WIPO, 2024). In most jurisdictions, patent protection can apply only to applications that amount to new inventions and are connected to some technological device, such as control systems for autonomous driving. Regarding AI-generated inventions, the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom ruled in 2021 that AI cannot be named as a patent inventor because a machine cannot hold (and transmit) property rights and has not devised any relevant invention (United Kingdom, The Supreme Court, 2021). Similar conclusions have been reached by the United States Patent and Trademark Office and the European Patent Office.1 A notable exception is in South Africa, where a patent naming an AI system as inventor was granted in 2021 (IPWatchdog, 2021).2 Consumers lack trust about personal data protection 149 Chapter V Global collaboration for inclusive and equitable AI Another challenge for intellectual property policy is how to balance the need to train AI models with real-world data while protecting existing copyrights. 3 The following signed the convention in September 2024: Andorra; Georgia; Iceland; Israel; Norway; Republic of Moldova; San Marino; United Kingdom; United States; and European Union, on behalf of the 27 member States. In many instances, it is not clear whether training data fall under current exceptions to copyright protection. On these and other issues, it is important to ensure clarity, coherence and consistency. C. AI governance initiatives from international forums A fragmented political process Recent multilateral forums have created a variety of initiatives and frameworks, including the following: \u2022 OECD \u2013 In 2019, OECD approved the Recommendation of the Council on Artificial Intelligence, setting the first intergovernmental standards to foster innovation and trust in AI. \u2022 Group of 20 (G20) \u2013 In 2019, the G20 AI principles called for AI stakeholders to ensure accountability and beneficial outcomes for people and the planet. \u2022 Global Partnership on AI \u2013 In 2023, a ministerial declaration by the Global Partnership on AI underscored the need for ethical considerations to be woven into AI. \u2022 Group of Seven (G7) \u2013 In 2023, the G7 launched the Hiroshima Process, defining a risk-based code of conduct for advanced AI systems but leaving different jurisdictions to choose their own approaches. \u2022 AI Safety Summit \u2013 The Bletchley Declaration in 2023 called for reinforced cooperation for risk-based policies. \u2022 AI Seoul Summit \u2013 In 2024, the Seoul Declaration highlighted potential risks posed by advanced AI and proposed the creation of an international network of AI safety institutes. \u2022 Council of Europe \u2013 In 2024, the Council of Europe issued the first international legally binding treaty in the field of AI, namely, The Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence and Human Rights, Democracy and the Rule of Law.3 However, none of these initiatives can be considered comprehensive. Figure V.2 shows that these seven major international initiatives are largely driven by members of the G7, whereas 118 countries, mostly from the Global South, are party to none (United Nations, AI Advisory Body, 2024). Existing international initiatives may lack coordination or alignment, risking gaps and incompatibilities that could lead to a patchwork of fragmented regimes worldwide. Many countries in the Global South provide essential services and resources fundamental to the functioning of AI systems, from content moderation to rare-earth metals (UNCTAD, 2024b), yet they have limited representation with regard to AI governance. Their absence may prevent governance frameworks from effectively addressing key challenges and priorities in developing countries, such as environmental degradation from AI-related mining and poor labour conditions in AI hardware manufacturing and the AI life cycle (see chapter II), as well as the socioeconomic impacts of AI-driven data work in vulnerable areas. The under- representation of developing countries in international initiatives may result in a failure of global AI governance 150 Global AI governance should involve more inclusive engagement with the Global South and with marginalized and vulnerable communities, who have largely been excluded despi",

Emerging common principles The evolution of the seven major international AI governance initiatives reveals a notable shift in approach from one based on principles to one based on risks (table V.1). This has been accompanied by calls for industry stakeholders to guarantee the development of safe and trustworthy AI systems, paying greater attention to transparency and accountability along the AI life cycle.

This is an evolving field, and different countries are exploring or implementing regulations that reflect their diverse cultural, legal and political contexts. There are three common approaches, as follows: Principles-based A notable example is the set of OECD AI Principles adopted in 2019. Such principles offer flexibility and adaptability, based on broad guidelines that evolve with technological change. However, this approach has notable drawbacks. It is voluntary, which can lead to inconsistent adherence and a lack of accountability, and organizations may selectively follow or ignore the principles, prioritizing profits over ethics, potentially causing harm. Additionally, broad principles often lack the specificity needed in addressing complex technical and legal challenges such as privacy breaches, bias in AI algorithms and accountability in autonomous systems. To address these issues, regulatory frameworks need to be more precise. A possible solution is a comprehensive licencing regime that spans the entire AI life cycle, from hardware acquisition to model development and deployment. Entities would need to obtain licences at different stages, ensuring compliance with dedicated standards aimed at mitigating risks. By enforcing clear, preventive compliance rules, such a licencing system could help manage AI-related risks, safeguard public interests and build trust in AI technologies. Risk-based AI systems often function as black boxes with little indication of what is taking place inside. A risk-based approach identifies and mitigates potential harms before these technologies are deployed. In 2019, the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence issued the Beijing AI Principles, calling for continuous improvements in AI systems in terms of maturity, reliability and controllability. Similarly, the European Union AI Act classifies AI applications by levels of risk, namely, unacceptable, high, limited and minimal. High-risk applications, such as biometric identification, involve strict regulations aimed at preventing harm before applications reach the market. The risk-based approach addresses the complexity and unpredictability of AI systems. With the use of pre-emptive regulation, companies can only deploy AI systems that meet compliance standards. Such regulation eases the burdens on low-risk AI while applying strict oversight to high-risk applications. Additionally, it encourages safety and ethics from the outset, reducing collective harms. However, this approach also has limitations. Categorizing AI technologies can be highly subjective and challenging, particularly self-modifying AI systems that evolve over time. While this approach aims to prevent harm, it lacks provisions for corrective justice, meaning that affected individuals seeking compensation may need supplementary liability frameworks. 153 Liability-based The emerging liability-based approach to AI governance creates legal avenues for individuals to seek compensation for AI-related harms, promoting fairness and predictability by applying uniform rules and standards. By holding developers and deployers accountable for their AI systems, this approach encourages companies to prioritize safety, reliability and ethics from the outset. This can ensure more trustworthy and robust AI, benefiting both consumers and society. However, this might slow innovation if AI companies, concerned about legal repercussions from, for example, unintended misuse of their AI models, become overly cautious. In the United States, in 2024, the Senate of California passed the Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Models Act. Among other requirements, the act mandated developers to fulfil several obligations prior to model training, including a separate, written safety and security protocol and the capability to promptly enact a full shutdown.",

The United Nations contribution to AI governance Over the years, the United Nations has made a significant contribution to the global discourse on AI governance (figure V.3). For example, since 2017, ITU has organized sessions of the AI for Good Global Summit, a key platform that identifies AI applications to advance on the Sustainable Development Goals and scale such applications for global impacts. Other important United Nations-based platforms for advancing understanding on science and technology are the Commission on Science and Technology for Development (CSTD) and the Multi-stakeholder Forum on Science, Technology and Innovation for the Sustainable Development Goals (STI Forum). In 2021, member States adopted the first global standard on AI ethics. The UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence provides a shared framework of values, principles and actions for shaping legislation and policies (UNESCO, 2022). A key policy area is gender, including to protect girls and women and ensure that AI systems do not violate their human rights or fundamental freedoms; the recommendation also calls for investment in girls\u2019 and women\u2019s participation in STEM and ICT disciplines, to improve their employability and help ensure equal career development. The recommendation is accompanied by a readiness assessment methodology that helps countries measure their preparedness for applying AI and an ethical impact assessment for evaluating the benefits and risks of AI systems (UNESCO, 2023). In 2024, the United Nations General Assembly adopted two resolutions, one on seizing the opportunities of safe, secure and trustworthy AI systems for sustainable development (United Nations General Assembly, 2024a) and one on enhancing international cooperation on capacity-building of AI (United Nations General Assembly, 2024b).

This highlights the importance of international cooperation in harnessing STI while bridging the growing divide within and between countries. This was accompanied by a Global Digital Compact that sets a series of commitments for enhancing international AI governance for the benefit of humanity (United Nations General Assembly, 2024c).4 The development of AI is intrinsically connected to the collection, processing, storage and use of digital data.",

This was accompanied by a Global Digital Compact that sets a series of commitments for enhancing international AI governance for the benefit of humanity (United Nations General Assembly, 2024c).4 The development of AI is intrinsically connected to the collection, processing, storage and use of digital data. The CSTD has been requested to establish a dedicated working group to engage in a comprehensive and inclusive multi- stakeholder dialogue on data governance at all levels as relevant for development, which will report on its progress to the General Assembly in 2026. The group will consider equitable and interoperable data governance arrangements, such as fundamental principles of data governance for development, proposals to support interoperability between national, regional and international data systems, with considerations of sharing the benefits of data and options to facilitate safe, 4 During the intergovernmental process of the Global Digital Compact, several thematic deep-dive consultations were conducted to discuss priorities and key issues, one of which focused on AI and other emerging technologies and centred on harmonizing institutional coherence and the importance of aligning digital transformation strategies, data governance and cybersecurity frameworks. secure and trusted data flows (United Nations General Assembly, 2024c). Following on the recommendations of the High-Level Advisory Body on Artificial Intelligence, in the Global Digital Compact, Member States committed to the establishment of a multidisciplinary Independent International Scientific Panel on AI and a Global Dialogue on AI Governance. These initiatives aim to promote reliable scientific AI understanding through evidence-based impact, risk and opportunity assessments. By sharing best practices, they also support interoperability and compatible approaches to AI governance. Other United Nations agencies and bodies have been leveraging AI for the Sustainable Development Goals, as well as informing and shaping global AI governance. For example, UNESCO has developed Guidance for Generative AI in Education and Research, UNICEF has developed Policy Guidance on AI for Children and WHO has developed Guidance on the Ethics and Governance of Artificial Intelligence for Health. In coordinating efforts across various domains, international law offers a shared normative foundation that can support coherent global AI governance and avoid the proliferation of fragmented initiatives and institutions. E. Ensuring accountability All players in the AI life cycle should have well-defined roles, namely, developers need to ensure the fairness and safety of their systems and users need to ensure ethical AI deployment. All should be accountable, through frameworks that define responsibilities, foster transparency and ensure responsible use. International law can provide a foundation in coordinating AI-related efforts across different domains 156 Given the growing influence of technology giants, companies, particularly those deploying large-scale AI systems, should be required to make public disclosures of their activities. This would help anticipate and address potential impacts of AI, increase systemic resilience and enhance transparency and accountability. One possible model is the ESG framework. An AI equivalent could involve impact assessments across stakeholders throughout the AI life cycle, measuring the effects on the environment, employment, human rights, safety and inclusivity (figure V.4). Companies can use international guidelines and standards as a basis for impact assessments. Carried out before and after deployment, these can shed light on how AI systems affect jobs, wages and working conditions, for example, and ensure that companies have mitigation strategies to support workers.5 5 An example is the guidelines for AI and shared prosperity developed by the Partnership on AI that include a job impact assessment tool, responsible practices and other resources, https://partnershiponai.org/paper/ shared-prosperity/. Public disclosure measures should also detail how AI systems work, including algorithmic decision-making processes; the collection, use and management of data; and efforts to ensure fairness and accountability. Auditing impact assessments and public reports helps ensure compliance with established guidelines, identify potential risks and certify that AI systems meet standards for fairness, transparency and safety. The evolution of ESG reporting provides valuable lessons for engaging the private sector in developing AI accountability mechanisms.",

Public disclosure of AI systems should: Balance innovation and safety \u2013 Policymakers need to strike a balance between fostering innovation and ensuring public safety and trust. Overregulation may hinder technological progress, while underregulation could pose significant risks and make it difficult to hold companies accountable. It is also important to consider the regulatory burden on SMEs. Larger firms may find it easier to meet stringent AI regulations, since they have the resources to manage legal risks and deal with complex regulatory requirements (Kretschmer et al., 2023). In contrast, SMEs may lack the skills or resources required to achieve compliance, potentially diverting funds from innovation and making them less competitive. SMEs may therefore need support, particularly in developing countries, where AI ecosystems are less developed. Incorporate flexibility \u2013 The requirements should be flexible and capable of adapting to rapidly evolving technologies. Regulations need to be regularly updated to address emerging ethical dilemmas and incorporate technological breakthroughs and unforeseen impacts that appear with the diffusion of AI. Involve different stakeholders \u2013 Policies and requirements need to reflect diverse perspectives, interests and expertise; it is therefore important to take a multi- stakeholder approach, involving the private sector, civil society and academia. Particular attention should be given to vulnerable populations, who are less likely to benefit from AI advances but more likely to experience AI-related harms. For example, AI can exacerbate existing gender inequality and amplify biases. It is also critical to encourage workers to participate in the design and implementation of AI systems, guaranteeing that new AI tools complement their work and are aligned with their needs and interests. To ensure fairness and positive outcomes across societies and jurisdictions, existing platforms, such as the AI for Good Global Summit, the CSTD, the STI Forum and Global Dialogue on AI Governance, can serve as venues to discuss common AI public disclosure requirements and accountability in AI governance. These platforms can also help strengthen data governance cooperation at all levels and unlock the full potential of digital and emerging technologies. F. International cooperation for infrastructure, data and skills Harnessing the benefits of AI inclusively requires international actions at each of the three leverage points of infrastructure, data and skills. International collaboration can enable countries to develop consistent approaches and actions, as well as pool resources and expertise for directing AI development towards the benefit of humanity. Such collaboration is critical in order to avoid fragmentation, duplication of efforts and the risks of AI use amplifying inequality across borders.",

International collaboration can enable countries to develop consistent approaches and actions, as well as pool resources and expertise for directing AI development towards the benefit of humanity. Such collaboration is critical in order to avoid fragmentation, duplication of efforts and the risks of AI use amplifying inequality across borders. For effective global collaboration on infrastructure, data and skills, the following sections outline three propositions, 158 namely, digital public infrastructure, open innovation and capacity-building and research collaboration. Developing digital public infrastructure for AI To address the increasing demands for connectivity and computing power, DPI models can offer an equitable approach to provide the necessary access and services to stakeholders of the AI ecosystem. DPI is a set of shared, secure and interoperable digital systems and applications that can be used flexibly in different activities and sectors. It can be built on open standards to provide societies with equitable access to public and private services (G20, 2023a). DPI connects people, businesses and Governments through secure and reliable online systems, and it is often referred to as the infrastructure of the digital era. Building on foundational physical infrastructure, such as networks, data centres and storage systems, DPI offers a shared means to many ends, including e-government services, digital identity systems and digital payment systems. There are many successful experiences across countries. For example, in Estonia, a DPI platform facilitated the secure exchange of data across consumers, energy distributors and producers, to enhance decision-making in the energy sector. In India, a DPI approach led the way for identification provision to over 1 billion people. In Togo, during the pandemic, social assistance to about 450,000 people was distributed within one week through a DPI platform (UNDP, 2023a). It is estimated that low- and middle-income countries can achieve the equivalent of two to three years of growth by implementing DPI in the financial sector. In the climate sector, DPI is expected to bring benefits to carbon offsetting and trading, accelerating emissions control 6 For instance, DPI governance that encompasses regulatory frameworks and data governance is key to ensure secure and inclusive implementation and safeguard data sovereignty, protection and security. efforts by 5\u201310 years (UNDP, 2023a). The Secretary-General has selected DPI as one of the high-impact initiatives that can accelerate progress on achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Developing countries can provide resources to build flexible DPI systems and support AI adoption and development. For example, Governments, alone or with private partners, can establish high-speed networks for reliable, fast Internet access, enabling data transfer and real-time AI applications. Data centres can ensure secure, efficient storage and easy access to information, and support platforms such as cloud services and government databases for seamless data exchanges. Interoperable frameworks can unlock data exchanges and open data platforms, enhancing the use of AI models across sectors. Combining high-speed networks and data centres, high-performance computing provides scalable computing power for AI training, applications and data management. These modular components can address particular challenges and needs in developing countries, offering resources that can enable collaboration, innovation and responsible AI deployment at scale (figure V.5). Despite the potential of DPI for AI, developing countries face significant challenges in its design and implementation. The international community can support developing countries by providing a combination of guidelines and principles,6 financial resources and technical expertise. In 2023, for example, the G20 Digital Economy Ministers reached a consensus on how to leverage DPI for digital inclusion and innovation. The framework includes a list of key components and principles (G20, 2023a), as well as a playbook with practical guidelines and a design checklist (UNDP, 2023b). In addition, to address the existing knowledge gaps in practices for designing, building and deploying population-scale DPI, the G20 has created a Global Digital Public Infrastructure Repository (G20, 2023b). A modular approach allows digital public infrastructure to be tailored to particular AI needs 159 Chapter V Global collaboration for inclusive and equitable AI Other international programmes and initiatives are emerging, including the following: \u2022 The United Nations High Impact Initiative on DPI \u2013 Aimed at unlocking tar",

Figure V.5 Developing digital public infrastructure for AI Source: UNCTAD. Physical infrastructure High-speed networks Storage systems Data centres High-performance computing hardware DPI for AI Data-sharing Data storage AI training and testing Internet access Cloud computing Interaction across digital platforms On-demand access to computing resources Enhanced collaboration Real-time AI applications 160 \u2022 The Global Digital Compact \u2013 The Compact represents the latest landmark, with countries committed to increasing investment and funding towards the development of DPI to advance solutions for the Sustainable Development Goals (United Nations General Assembly, 2024c). Efforts from the international community can help scale up and tailor DPIs for AI, providing developing countries with the foundational systems needed for digital inclusion and technological innovation. The international community could provide developing countries with financial support or access to existing DPIs (Gottschalk, 2019). DPI for AI can rely on two service models that, compared with traditional infrastructure, provide greater flexibility, scalability and global accessibility. The first is infrastructure as a service, which provides virtualized computing resources on the cloud on an as-needed basis, including servers, storage and networking. The second is data as a service, which provides data on demand, through application programming interfaces, or cloud-based platforms, enabling users to access, manage and analyse data sets without owning the underlying infrastructure. Cloud and data resources from infrastructure as a service and data as a service providers can be leveraged to develop packaged, cloud deployable and interoperable AI services. Infrastructure as a service and data as a service are mainly owned and operated by private companies on a commercial basis. However, governments can collaborate with these companies to offer services within the local AI ecosystem. 7 CERN not only provides a unique range of particle accelerator facilities to researchers, but also trains new generations of physicists, engineers and technicians and engages all citizens in research and in the values of science. Its research in fundamental physics helps uncover what the universe is made of and how it works, and at the same time introduces new solutions to different fields of work. For example, CERN collaborates with different institutions to create network platforms to foster AI research in medicine. One of their AI algorithms designed to diagnose anomalies in the CERN accelerator chain, has the potential to identify brain pathologies including strokes, see https://home.cern/news/news/knowledge-sharing/accelerating-stroke-prevention. 8 For instance, the International Computation and AI Network aims to leverage experts\u2019 knowledge and broaden access to the world\u2019s foremost supercomputing resources to develop AI models that benefit society worldwide. It plans to be fully operational by early 2025, see https://www.icain.org/. Public-private partnerships can expedite the development of DPI for AI. To increase their collective negotiating power and strike equitable terms, developing countries could pool resources through regional or multi- country partnerships. In addition, multi- stakeholder collaborations could foster innovation in the digital ecosystem and facilitate the exchange of best practices (UNDP, 2023b).",

In addition, multi- stakeholder collaborations could foster innovation in the digital ecosystem and facilitate the exchange of best practices (UNDP, 2023b). These partnerships can also help set international standards, governance principles and regulatory frameworks, to foster an inclusive and sustainable AI development and adoption framework. DPI for AI services requires high- performance computing hardware, data centres and other complex and expensive physical infrastructure that few individual institutions or countries can afford. To provide affordable and distributed AI infrastructure, one model is that of CERN, the intergovernmental organization that operates the world\u2019s largest particle physics laboratory, including the Large Hadron Collider, in France and Switzerland. This shared resource is used by researchers globally. A CERN for AI model can be based on the principles of international cooperation, open science, open access and the pooling of resources and expertise.7 A similar shared facility for AI research and development would enable countries and organizations to engage in cutting- edge research, counterbalancing the power of technology giants and promoting equitable access to AI resources.8 Compared to the Large Hadron Collider, computational resources for AI can be more easily spatially distributed. A CERN for AI model can provide equitable access to AI infrastructure 161 Chapter V Global collaboration for inclusive and equitable AI A shared AI infrastructure could be developed as a distributed public infrastructure across institutions and countries in multiple centres using high- speed networks, with system interoperability and security protocols.9 A key element for success is the involvement and openness of various stakeholders, including Governments, businesses, academia and civil society, which could use the shared facility as a virtual space for interaction, experimentation and co-creation. Promoting AI through open innovation Open innovation provides a way of managing the innovation process and enabling collaboration and knowledge- sharing among independent innovators, companies, institutions and countries. Compared with the traditional model of innovation where each company relies on its own resources, open innovation encourages firms, public organizations and other actors to tap into the large pool of innovative resources available among external actors, including customers and citizens. Open innovation can speed up research and development, lower costs and enhance the quality or relevance of innovation outcomes,10 which is particularly beneficial for developing countries and SMEs, to compensate for limited resources and skills. Open innovation has gained significant traction in recent years and is widely recognized as a key driver of technological opportunities, enabling risk and cost-sharing and the championing of transparency while democratizing access to diverse, technically advanced resources. For example, through the Global Digital Compact, United Nations Member States have committed to developing safe and secure open-source software, open data, open AI models and 9 This is, for example, the current approach discussed within the European Union, where the Group of Chief Scientific Advisers has suggested the creation of a European Distributed Institute for AI in Science. 10 For example, the European Commission characterizes the concept of open innovation as combining the power of ideas and knowledge from different actors to co-create new products and find solutions to societal needs, as well as creating shared economic and social value, including a citizen and user-centric approach (European Commission, 2016). open standards, also referred to as digital public goods (United Nations General Assembly, 2024c). Another important effort is the Manaus package issued under the Presidency of Brazil by the G20 Research and Innovation Working Group. This includes an open innovation strategy to foster international collaboration on STI, and puts forward principles, approaches and tools for inclusive and equitable open innovation initiatives (G20, 2024). Concepts and approaches for open innovation are still evolving, but they generally involve open data, that is, making data freely available.",

Concepts and approaches for open innovation are still evolving, but they generally involve open data, that is, making data freely available. This can facilitate the training and testing of AI models and foster innovation by allowing researchers and developers to experiment with data and create new AI solutions. Open data can also improve transparency and facilitate the assessment of new AI models and applications. Prominent examples of open data initiatives include the Human Genome Project, the COVID-19 Open Research Data Set and the Human Connectome Project. Most emerging open data platforms for AI are from the private sector, such as the Kaggle data sets, the OpenAI data sets, the Microsoft Azure open data sets and the registry of open data on Amazon Web Services. They vary in their operation, data management approaches and open data standards. Common international definitions and standards for open data are essential to give both the public and private sectors access to high quality and diverse data and make them digital public goods. Further important aspects include privacy, security and the prevention of data misuse and misinterpretation. Another important instrument is open source, largely diffused in software development. 162 This is a model wherein the source code, design or blueprint of a software package or a project is made freely available through public platforms. Well-known open-source operating systems include Android and Linux, which power critical infrastructure and digital devices. By providing free and open tools, libraries and frameworks, the use of open source democratizes knowledge and resources, enables global collaboration and innovation and improves transparency and trust. Since the emergence of GenAI, there has been a surge in open-source AI and GenAI projects. These include commercial large language models, as well as applications developed by academic institutions and individual developers (Daigle and GitHub staff, 2023). The code is communally maintained on open-source platforms such as GitHub and others, which offer diverse use cases and readily accessible AI models, with community engagement for discussion and mutual support. The international community can benefit from coordinating and harmonizing the important but fragmented open AI resources worldwide. Successful open innovation for AI relies on connected and interoperable open repositories of global knowledge, using open data and open source in a global innovators network with standardized protocols. Such a repository can strengthen the global knowledge base, foster inclusiveness, improve access through trusted hubs that ensure quality and security, mitigate potential risks and accelerate AI-driven innovation (figure V.6). Strengthening capacity- building and research collaboration Both DPI and open innovation provide accessible resources for businesses, academia and the general public to engage in the adoption and development of AI. The use of open data and open-source systems can help democratize knowledge and resources for AI innovation Figure V.6 Open innovation in AI Source: UNCTAD. Open data Open source Global innovators network Open access to diverse data sets Freely available source code, models, libraries and other resources Open innovation Connected and interoperable open repositories 163 Chapter V Global collaboration for inclusive and equitable AI However, using these resources requires technical knowledge and skills, such as statistical knowledge, programming skills, familiarity with open-source platforms and protocols and knowledge of machine learning algorithms, as well as an understanding of the domain for which an application is to be used. These capacities are often highly concentrated in technology companies and developed countries, an imbalance that the international community should address through the transfer of knowledge and technology to developing countries, as well as assistance for capacity-building. The CSTD has been advancing international STI collaboration through knowledge and experience-sharing, and capacity- building. The Commission can further strengthen international AI collaboration by sharing good practices, facilitating coordination and contributing to enhanced trust, transparency and inclusivity.",

The CSTD has been advancing international STI collaboration through knowledge and experience-sharing, and capacity- building. The Commission can further strengthen international AI collaboration by sharing good practices, facilitating coordination and contributing to enhanced trust, transparency and inclusivity. Multi-stakeholder engagement and knowledge-sharing on AI, through international dialogues or global networks of exchange, for example, could build on existing platforms such as the CSTD, the STI Forum, the Internet Governance Forum and the AI for Good Global Summit. It is also important to have technical assistance and tailored solutions based on local needs and the limited absorptive capacities of many developing countries. This can help effective transfers of technical knowledge and reduce the risk of misuse due to a lack of resources or expertise. Knowledge and technology transfer typically focus on particular information, skills or activities. Capacity-building is critical in adopting and developing rapidly evolving frontier technologies, and encompasses a broad set of capabilities that enable individuals or countries to innovate continuously. It can take place through training workshops that enable policymakers to develop STI policies or tailored educational programmes on AI and data literacy. Capacity-building can also take place through AI incubators and research hubs and R&D partnerships. Special attention should be given to the adoption and development of human-complementary AI technologies. This can be achieved by allocating dedicated funding to AI solutions that augment rather than replace workers, and setting up international AI research networks or partnerships that prioritize human-centred AI. These activities align with the resolution adopted by the General Assembly on enhancing international cooperation on capacity-building of artificial intelligence, particularly in developing countries, as well as the Global Digital Compact, which encourages the development of international partnerships on AI capacity-building. To create global hubs for AI capacity-building or an AI-focused centre and network, a useful model and reference point is the United Nations Climate Technology Centre and Network. This is the implementation arm of the Technology Mechanism of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which supports developing countries through technical assistance and access to information and knowledge on technologies, including capacity-building and policy advice, as well as fosters collaboration among stakeholders via its network of regional and sectoral experts. While the CERN model focuses on shared infrastructure, the Climate Technology Centre and Network approach is aimed at providing technical assistance to developing countries and building capacity through knowledge and technology transfer. An AI-focused centre and network could help developing countries in adopting, adapting and developing AI. This could build on existing efforts such as the International Research Centre on Artificial Intelligence under UNESCO auspices, which promotes ethical AI solutions for the Sustainable Development Goals, and the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence, which advances the implementation of human-centric, safe, secure and trustworthy AI solutions. An international AI centre can provide technical assistance, build capacity and foster collaboration 164 Furthermore, collaboration in AI research and innovation can help scale up South\u2013South cooperation in science and technology to address common challenges (United Nations General Assembly, 2019). For this purpose, the more technologically advanced developing countries can collaborate with other countries, for example, through regional partnerships, to create critical mass in AI, favouring knowledge and technology transfer, and overcoming the resource constraints that may hamper the establishment of thriving AI ecosystems in less-endowed countries. In recent years, there have been numerous instances of new South\u2013South cooperation in the field of AI. The BRICS member countries, for example, have formed an AI study group aimed at catalysing AI innovation. China has expanded cooperation with Africa in various areas, including AI, as outlined in the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (China, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 2024). In 2024, the launch of the ASEAN Committee on Science, Technology and Innovation Tracks on AI aimed at expanding regional capacity development initiatives in AI (ASEAN, 2024).",

These initiatives represent promising starting points for South\u2013South cooperation, and the Global South can also make use of other mechanisms for exchanging AI technologies, data and services. The Global South can, for example, incorporate provisions for AI technology and services in trade agreements and engage regional institutions such as the African Union or ASEAN for sharing best practices and developing coherent AI policies. In addition, developing countries can build regional innovation hubs and expert networks for addressing AI challenges. In Africa, for instance, the Artificial Intelligence for Development programme scales AI innovations through the creation of four pan-African Innovation Research Networks and supports policy research by funding two research-to-policy and think-and-do tanks in East Africa and a policy network in West Africa. It also engages African talent and skills through two multidisciplinary university labs. Other ways in which countries in the Global South can work together are mobility programmes, human capital development initiatives and joint research and technical projects in the field of AI and other frontier technologies.

One of the most important areas is agriculture, for which a major resource is the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), the largest global partnership focusing on agricultural research for development, which can integrate AI as a tool to create and diffuse new solutions for climate-smart, innovative and socially inclusive agriculture, while addressing challenges such as crop disease and pest detection, yield prediction and precision irrigation. A thematic approach of AI partnership can help coordinate and target efforts in key areas that are most relevant to the socioeconomic and developmental needs of the Global South. G. Guiding AI for shared prosperity Technology does not have intrinsic moral or ethical qualities. Whether its impact is positive or negative depends on how humans develop and use it. At first glance, AI technologies are no different; their use can enhance various aspects of our lives, but can also deepen inequalities and further concentrate economic power (Korinek and Stiglitz, 2021). Nevertheless, AI is beginning to challenge the notion of technological neutrality. This is the first technology in history capable of making decisions and generating ideas by recombining existing knowledge, and which could evolve into an active agent. As AI grows faster and more powerful, the potential response times shorten and the room for error may become smaller (AI Action Summit, 2025). History shows that technological progress brings economic growth but does not guarantee that the benefits will be broadly distributed, nor does it necessarily lead to inclusive and equitable human development. Driven forward by new technologies, markets may make efficient economic decisions in the short term, but do not assume responsibility for distributive consequences or automatically maximize social value. Technological advances have typically fostered the rise of technology giants and favoured the owners of capital at the expense of labour, leading to greater concentration of wealth (Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2019; Korinek et al., 2021). There is an urgent need to guide AI advances. Responsible design, conscientious use and ethical oversight of AI depends on effective global AI governance, along with international support for developing countries through DPI, open innovation and capacity-building.",

UNCTAD, in this report, calls for a shift of focus from technology to people, putting humans at the centre of AI development. AI technologies should complement rather than displace human workers, and the transformation of production processes should bring benefits that are shared fairly among countries, firms and workers. Inclusion and equity are central to an AI- for-all approach, supported by policies, incentives and regulations driven by a global agenda that promotes international multi-stakeholder collaboration. Humans should be at the centre of AI development Inclusion and equity should be at the forefront of AI for all 166 References 50 in 5 (2024).

However, their rapid and widespread diffusion is often outpacing the ability of many Governments to respond. The Technology and Innovation Report 2025: Inclusive Artificial Intelligence for Development surveys the complex artificial intelligence landscape, aiming to help decision makers design science, technology and innovation policies that foster inclusive technological progress. The use of artificial intelligence has the potential to accelerate progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, but if unevenly distributed and not guided by ethical oversight and transparency, its diffusion can exacerbate existing inequalities. The report analyses the requirements and policies needed at all stages, from development to adoption, to foster inclusive technological progress for sustainable development. This requires a multidimensional and evidence-based approach. For this purpose, three key leverage points \u2013 infrastructure, data and skills \u2013 are identified, offering a broad socioeconomic perspective and highlighting the need to build resilient infrastructure and promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and innovation. Technology and Innovation Report 2025 Inclusive Artificial Intelligence for Development Overview v The report starts by documenting the significant concentration in artificial intelligence development in a few companies and countries and identifies extensive gaps in digital infrastructure that risk widening inequalities both within and among countries. Then it explores productivity and workforce dynamics focusing on economic growth and decent work. From a national perspective, the report analyses the requirements and policies needed to support adoption, adaptation and development of artificial intelligence. From an international perspective, it considers the need for global artificial intelligence governance to steer artificial intelligence towards inclusive and equitable development, emphasizing the importance of international collaboration. History has shown that while technological progress drives economic growth, it does not on its own ensure equitable income distribution or promote inclusive human development. Stronger international cooperation can shift the focus from technology to people, enabling countries to co-create a global artificial intelligence framework. Such a framework should prioritize shared prosperity, create public goods and place humanity at the heart of artificial intelligence development.

Global collaboration is key to ensuring that the benefits of AI reach everyone, shifting the focus from technology to people Steering artificial intelligence towards shared prosperity Frontier technologies, particularly artificial intelligence (AI), are profoundly transforming our economies and societies, reshaping production processes, labour markets and the ways in which we live and interact. Will AI accelerate progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals, or will it exacerbate existing inequalities, leaving the underprivileged further behind? How can developing countries harness AI for sustainable development? AI is the first technology in history that can make decisions and generate ideas on its own. This sets it apart from traditional technologies and challenges the notion of technological neutrality. The rapid development of AI has also outpaced the ability of Governments to respond effectively. The Technology and Innovation Report 2025 aims to guide policymakers through the complex AI landscape and support them in designing science, technology and innovation (STI) policies that foster inclusive and equitable technological progress. The world already has significant digital divides, and with the rise of AI, these could widen even further. In response, the Report argues for AI development based on inclusion and equity, shifting the focus from technology to people. AI technologies should complement rather than displace human workers and production should be restructured so that the benefits are shared fairly among countries, firms and workers. It is also important to strengthen international collaboration, to enable countries to co-create inclusive AI governance. The Report examines five core themes: A AI at the technological frontier B Leveraging AI for productivity and workers\u2019 empowerment C Preparing to seize AI opportunities D Designing national policies for AI E Global collaboration for inclusive and equitable AI Technology and Innovation Report 2025 Inclusive Artificial Intelligence for Development Overview viii 1 1 AI at the technology frontier \u00a9 Adobe Stock Technology and Innovation Report 2025 Inclusive Artificial Intelligence for Development Overview 2 Figure 1 Rapid expansion of frontier technologies (Market size estimates, billions of dollars) Source: UNCTAD based on various online market research reports.

AI IoT Big data Blockchain technology 5G 3D Printing Robotics Drone technology Solar PV Concentrated solar power Biofuels Biogas and biomass Wind energy Green hydrogen Electric vehicles Nanotechnology Gene editing 16.4 trillion 2.5 trillion 925 138 2023 2033 189 AI AI IoT Blockchain Electric vehicles 5G Electric vehicles IoT In 2023, frontier technologies represented a $2.5 trillion market and it is estimated that this figure will increase sixfold, to $16.4 trillion, in the next decade (figure 1). By 2033, AI is likely to be the frontier technology that has the largest market size, at around $4.8 trillion. Continuous breakthroughs are making AI more powerful and efficient, favouring its adoption in many sectors and business functions, including content creation, product development, automated coding and personalized customer service. The leading frontier technology providers are now among the largest corporations in the world by market capitalization. Apple, Nvidia and Microsoft each have capitalizations of more than $3 trillion, close to the gross domestic product (GDP) of the African continent, or that of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the world\u2019s sixth largest economy.1 The top five companies are from the United States of America, and three leading chipmakers \u2013 Nvidia, Broadcom and TSMC2 \u2013 are among the world\u2019s top ten; almost all are focused on frontier technologies and are investing heavily in AI (figure 2). 1 GDP is a flow variable and market capitalization is a stock variable; the present comparison is for illustrative purposes only, to highlight the significant market size of leading technology companies. 2 Nvidia and Broadcom, United States; TSMC, Taiwan Province of China.

In 2022, 40 per cent of business-funded R&D worldwide was carried out by only 100 companies, of which around half were headquartered in the United States, led by Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and Apple. Around 13 per cent were headquartered in China, led by Huawei and Tencent, up from 2 per cent 10 years before and overtaking traditional R&D leaders such as Germany, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Switzerland and the United Kingdom (figure 3). Other than China, none of the top 100 corporate R&D investors are from developing countries. Market dominance, at both the corporate and national levels, risks widening global technological divides, making it even more difficult for latecomers to catch up. Similarly, there is a significant AI divide between developed and developing countries. With regard to infrastructure, for example, the United States has around one third of the top 500 supercomputers and more than half of the overall computational performance. Most data centres are also located in the United States. Apart from Brazil, China, India and the Russian Federation, developing countries have limited capacities in AI infrastructure, which hinders their ability to adopt and develop AI. An AI divide is also evident in terms of services providers, investment and knowledge creation. A wide AI divide exists between developed and developing countries Technology and Innovation Report 2025 Inclusive Artificial Intelligence for Development Overview 4 Figure 3 Significant concentration of research and development in a few countries (Share of investment by global top 100 corporate R&D investors, by country; percentage) Source: The 2023 EU Industrial R&D Investment Scoreboard (Joint Research Centre, 2023). 2022 2012 United States of America China Germany Japan Republic of Korea Switzerland United Kingdom 49 39 13 2 12 11 8 20 4 4 4 6 3 3 AI holds great potential for development but also risks \u2013 informed leadership is key to harnessing AI for sustainable and inclusive development As a general-purpose technology, AI interacts with other technologies and is transforming the way research and innovation are conducted, with a wide range of applications across various activities. AI offers significant opportunities for businesses and countries to grow and to progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. However, it also presents various risks and ethical concerns. Decision makers need to know more about AI if they are to navigate its promises and perils for sustainable and inclusive development. The experience of recent decades indicates that AI-driven transformations involve three key leverage points \u2013 infrastructure, data and skills (figure 4). (a) Infrastructure requirements extend beyond basic access to electricity and the Internet, encompassing computing power and server capabilities, to process data, run algorithms and execute models. (b) Data are the primary input for the training, validation and testing of algorithms, enabling AI systems to classify inputs, generate outputs and make predictions. High-quality, diverse and unbiased data are essential for building effective and trustworthy AI systems. (c) Skills span a wide spectrum, from basic data literacy to advanced technical expertise in developing algorithms and from proficiency in data analysis to integrating domain knowledge for tackling complex problems.

AI Infrastructure Data to train AI models Algorithms to extract the most from data Data Skills Data to optimize the use of infrastructure Infrastructure to support the processing and storage of complex data sets Algorithms to optimize the use of computational power Infrastructure to enable the operation of AI models and applications The rapid progress of AI is driven by three key leverage points \u2013 infrastructure, data, and skills \u2013 that can catalyse continuous innovation The interplay of and synergies among these three key leverage points can accelerate advances in AI. These are discussed in the report as a way of connecting the evidence and framing its policy recommendations.

Governments need to explore policies and regulations that can incentivize and guide technological development along paths that promote inclusivity and benefit all. \u0007Augmenting human capabilities \u2013 Frontier technologies are capital-intensive and could be labour- saving. For many developing countries, this could erode their comparative advantage of low labour costs, putting at risk the gains of recent decades. With appropriate policies, however, AI can augment rather than substitute human capabilities and help sustain the competitiveness of developing countries. \u0007Three key leverage points \u2013 Three key leverage points that could catalyse transformational cascades for AI are infrastructure, data and skills. These provide the basis for assessing a country\u2019s preparedness for AI, developing effective industrial and innovation policies and strengthening global AI governance and collaboration. 7 2 Leveraging AI for productivity and workers\u2019 empowerment \u00a9 Gorodenkoff - Shutterstock Technology and Innovation Report 2025 Inclusive Artificial Intelligence for Development Overview 8 Figure 5 Use of AI can improve a firm\u2019s labour productivity (Change in productivity, percentage) Source: UNCTAD (see bibliography in the report).

Generative AI (GenAI), for example, can generate texts, produce images and videos, write computer code and identify complex patterns in data for knowledge-based services. Research to date suggests that firms using AI can make substantial productivity gains, particularly those employing skilled workers and those in service industries (figure 5). However, the range of productivity estimates varies considerably, reflecting the differing capacities of firms to leverage AI effectively. In addition, much of the existing literature focuses on early adopters from developed countries, for which there is more detailed firm- level data. Whether similar productivity gains apply to latecomers, particularly in developing countries, remains to be ascertained. The use of AI has the potential to impact 40 per cent of global employment.",

Whether similar productivity gains apply to latecomers, particularly in developing countries, remains to be ascertained. The use of AI has the potential to impact 40 per cent of global employment. In advanced economies, one third of jobs are vulnerable to AI automation, while around 27 per cent have the potential for AI augmentation, that is, enhancing human capabilities rather than replacing them. Workforces in advanced economies are at greater risk, as more of their jobs involve cognitive tasks. Nevertheless, they are also better positioned than emerging and low-income economies to harness the benefits of AI (figure 6). A similar picture emerges when considering the impact of GenAI. However, GenAI might offer greater potential for labour augmentation than automation, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.

It will also take time to build complementary assets in AI infrastructure, data and skills. AI-related case studies in agriculture, manufacturing and health care, in which the use of AI enhanced productivity and human welfare, are summarized in table 1, illustrating how challenges related to infrastructure, data and skills can be overcome through careful implementation and collaboration among stakeholders. The use of AI can lead to productivity gains and increase the income of some workers, but it may lead to job losses for others, reshaping workplace dynamics and labour demand. To date, technological advances have tended to drive automation, shifting value towards capital. However, if supported by effective policies and strategic implementation, the use of AI offers significant potential for augmenting worker capabilities. Technology and Innovation Report 2025 Inclusive Artificial Intelligence for Development Overview 10 POLICY FOCUS \u0007Complex workforce dynamics \u2013 The impact of AI on workplaces depends on a complex interplay of automation, augmentation and the creation of new roles.

The UNCTAD frontier technologies readiness index helps assess countries\u2019 preparedness through key indicators Developing countries should prepare for a world that is rapidly being reshaped by AI and other frontier technologies. To assess the potential for progress, UNCTAD has devised the frontier technologies readiness index, which combines indicators for information and communications technology (ICT) deployment, skills, R&D activity, industrial capacity and access to finance, to offer a comprehensive measure of a country\u2019s preparedness for frontier technologies. The index rankings are dominated by developed countries in Europe and North America (table 2). Developing countries are generally lower in the rankings but Singapore stands out in fifth position and performs well across all the dimensions. The economies of Brazil, the Russian Federation, India, China and South Africa (BRICS), also have good ranking positions, notably China, at 21; the Russian Federation, at 33; India, at 36; Brazil, at 38; and South Africa, at 52.

This highlights the importance of making efforts to improve a national innovation ecosystem. The frontier technologies readiness index can be complemented with a detailed assessment of a country\u2019s preparedness for AI adoption and development, which depends critically on three leverage points: infrastructure, data and skills. Countries can be considered under four categories according to adoption and development capacities, as shown in the four quadrants in figure 8. This locates a country\u2019s current position, illustrating its relative strengths and weaknesses, as well as its potential catch-up trajectories (e.g. from laggards to practitioners, then to leaders). Technology and Innovation Report 2025 Inclusive Artificial Intelligence for Development Overview 14 Figure 8 Classification of countries according to their capacity for AI adoption and development Source: UNCTAD. High adoption Low development AI adoption capacity AI development capacity Practitioners Low adoption Low development Laggards Low adoption High development Creators High adoption High development Leaders Countries can be categorized by AI adoption and development capacities, revealing strengths, weaknesses and potential catch-up trajectories The assessment of country preparedness uses selected proxy indicators that have wide country coverage. The assessment can then be refined through detailed reviews of a country\u2019s STI ecosystem. For example, as shown in figure 9 with regard to skills, AI adoption capacity is proxied by the proportion of the working-age population with tertiary education and AI development capacity is proxied by the number of developers on the platform GitHub as a proportion of the working-age population. Differences in the level of AI skills preparedness may be observed across country groupings, with the least developed countries (LDCs) scoring low for both indicators. Developed countries rank higher than developing countries for both indicators, with the notable exceptions of Hong Kong (China) and Singapore. 15 Figure 9 Developed countries lead in AI skills preparedness (Percentages) Source: UNCTAD, based on data from GitHub and the International Labour Organization. Note: Names of economies abbreviated using International Organization for Standardization alpha-3 codes. * Hong Kong (China) and Singapore have very high shares of GitHub developers with respect to working-age population, at 25 and 27 per cent respectively; values have been truncated at 10 per cent to improve the presentation.

Technology and Innovation Report 2025 Inclusive Artificial Intelligence for Development Overview 16 POLICY FOCUS \u0007Strategic positioning \u2013 Governments should strategically position themselves to seize the opportunities offered by AI. This involves assessing national AI capacities across the three leverage points \u2013 infrastructure, data and skills; and identifying gaps to pinpoint areas of action. Different catch-up trajectories can steer the transition from current technological and productive capacities towards desired targets. \u0007Strengthening innovation systems \u2013 Countries can evaluate their AI opportunities and challenges through technology assessment and foresight exercises and identify actions to strengthen their innovation systems. UNCTAD assists developing countries in technology assessment, and its STI Policy Review Programme supports the development of their innovation systems. \u0007Government and stakeholder collaboration \u2013 Successful structural transformation requires cooperation among public authorities and ministries, such as those for STI, industry and education. Stakeholder engagement is crucial to identify AI solutions for sustainable development and to formulate STI plans that align with national objectives. Governments should position themselves to seize AI opportunities by assessing national capacities, identifying gaps, and defining catch- up trajectories to meet future goals 17 4 Designing national policies for AI \u00a9 Adobe Stock Technology and Innovation Report 2025 Inclusive Artificial Intelligence for Development Overview 18 Figure 10 Increased relevance of STI in national policies Source: UNCTAD, based on data from Global Trade Alert (GTA) and the Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development (OECD) STI policy database.

National competitiveness and the guiding industrial policies should increasingly be centred on enhancing technology, innovation and knowledge-intensive services. Since 2010, industrial policies have had an increasing share of interventions tied to scientific, technological or innovation-related aspects (figure 10). There has also been a general increase in R&D expenditure as a percentage of GDP, at least in most advanced economies. Most of this has been driven by the private sector, but some countries have also greatly expanded their public R&D allocations. Policies for frontier technologies and AI add new rationales for industrial policies. They can address market failures and take into account the uncertainty of R&D and of the diffusion, direction and impact of new technologies in the economy. To date, most AI policies have emerged from developed countries. By end-2023, about two thirds of developed countries had a national AI strategy; out of 89 national AI strategies, only 6 were from LDCs (figure 11). AI policies implemented by major economies can have significant spillover effects, influencing the policy options of other countries. Developing countries therefore need to quickly set and implement AI strategies that align with national development goals and agendas. Following the paths set by others may not fulfil their needs and priorities.

Policies targeting AI development, on the other hand, should consider the need for more advanced infrastructure, robust data systems and the skills and capabilities needed to stay at the technological frontier. The two approaches are not, however, mutually exclusive, and countries need to strike a balance between them. Some developing countries may find it less challenging to support adoption, but they also need to make long-term strategic plans to promote AI development. A series of illustrative examples of policy instruments implemented by economies at various stages of development are listed in table 3. The design and implementation of AI strategies for adoption and development should also account for country specificities involving the three key leverage points: infrastructure, data and skills.

AI policies are essential for achieving structural transformation and productivity growth, and for addressing other societal, ethical, and environmental challenges arising from the diffusion of the technology. Technology and Innovation Report 2025 Inclusive Artificial Intelligence for Development Overview 21 POLICY FOCUS AI requires a whole-of- government approach, aligning and coordinating actions across ministries, along with regulation and governance to guide technological change \u0007Rethinking industrial policies \u2013 Accelerated digitalization and the rise of AI call for new industrial policies. As value in the global economy shifts towards knowledge-intensive services, decision makers need to consider their roles in supporting the adoption and development of new technologies, as well as the creation, dissemination and absorption of productive knowledge in the economy. \u0007A whole-of-government approach \u2013 National strategies should target better coordination across domains, including STI, industry, education, infrastructure and trade. Moreover, AI policies should go beyond incentives, such as tax deductions, and include regulation, such as those related to consumer protection, digital platforms and data protection, along with governance and enforcement, to orient the direction of technological change.",

Moreover, AI policies should go beyond incentives, such as tax deductions, and include regulation, such as those related to consumer protection, digital platforms and data protection, along with governance and enforcement, to orient the direction of technological change. Policies should address the three leverage points: \u0007Infrastructure \u2014 Upgrading infrastructure is key to ensuring equitable access to enablers such as electricity and the Internet, favouring AI adoption and reducing inequalities. Fostering a conducive business environment to incentivize private sector investment can help build the necessary infrastructure. Distributed networks and computing power can support AI development, but it is important to ensure interoperability and harmonization between infrastructures and systems. \u0007Data \u2014 Encouraging open data and data-sharing can enhance data integration, storage, access and collaboration. Promoting good practices in data collection and ensuring interoperability and accessibility across the innovation ecosystem can support AI adoption and development. Privacy, accountability and intellectual property aspects should also be addressed, to foster innovation while safeguarding human rights. \u0007Skills \u2014 Population-wide AI literacy will promote widespread AI adoption and can be achieved by integrating science, technology, engineering and mathematics and AI subjects, from early education to continuous learning. Partnerships between academia and the private sector can help build AI talent to meet specific industry needs and drive AI development.

Note: The following initiatives are considered: OECD AI Principles, 2019; G20 AI principles, 2019; Council of Europe AI convention drafting group, 2022\u20132024; Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence Ministerial Declaration, 2022; G7 Leaders\u2019 Statement on the Hiroshima AI Process, 2023; Bletchley Declaration, 2023; and Seoul Ministerial Statement for advancing AI safety, innovation and inclusivity, 2024. 2/7 1/7 0/7 118 countries, primarily in the global South, are not parties to any of the sampled initiatives or instruments 7/7 6/7 5/7 4/7 3/7 AI diffusion brings cross- border impacts and requires global governance; ensuring AI as a public good demands multi- stakeholder cooperation Many AI-related issues can be addressed at the national level through well-designed policies. However, since AI involves intangible goods and services that can be replicated and used virtually anywhere, there are also cross-border impacts. This calls for international collaboration. Ensuring AI as a public good requires multi-stakeholder cooperation to make it accessible, equitable and beneficial for everyone, fostering inclusive innovation to tackle global challenges. AI is at present largely controlled by multinational technology giants. Without external oversight, businesses are unlikely to prioritize societal benefits over profit incentives. Governments therefore also need to influence and guide the development of AI in the public interest. At the global level, the AI governance landscape is shaped by a series of initiatives and frameworks that are not yet truly comprehensive. By end-2024, only the Group of Seven (G7) states participated in all major initiatives, while 118 countries, primarily from the Global South, were not represented (figure 12). The limited representation of developing countries is disproportionate to their significant roles in the use of AI and may result in the failure of global AI governance. AI governance suffers from fragmentation; the limited representation of developing countries could undermine the effectiveness of global AI governance 25 Technology and Innovation Report 2025 Inclusive Artificial Intelligence for Development Overview Figure 13 Key United Nations efforts in global AI governance Source: UNCTAD 1993 2016 2017 Multi-stakeholder platforms 2021 Ethical standard New initiatives Global resolutions 2024 Commission on Science and Technology for Development (CSTD) Multistakeholder Forum on Science",

In 2024, the General Assembly adopted two key resolutions on seizing the opportunities of safe, secure and trustworthy AI systems for sustainable development and on enhancing international cooperation on AI capacity-building. Moreover, the Pact for the Future emphasizes the importance of international cooperation for harnessing the benefits of STI while bridging the growing divide within and between countries. To this end, Member States committed to establishing an Independent International Scientific Panel on AI and initiating a Global Dialogue on AI Governance. Moreover, the Commission on Science and Technology for Development has established a dedicated working group to engage in a comprehensive and inclusive multi-stakeholder dialogue on data governance. Global discussions on AI governance have shifted from establishing principles for a human- centred approach to adopting risk-based frameworks for managing frontier AI systems. This has been accompanied by increasing demands for a more proactive role from industry stakeholders. Companies need to ensure the development of safe and trustworthy AI, with a greater emphasis on transparency and accountability across the AI life cycle. Transforming such commitments into practical, impactful outcomes requires the establishment of common standards and effective mechanisms for implementation. Technology and Innovation Report 2025 Inclusive Artificial Intelligence for Development Overview 26 POLICY FOCUS Impact assessments and detailed explanations about the functioning of AI models can improve transparency and accountability \u0007A framework for industry commitment \u2013 More demanding expectations about public disclosure for companies deploying large-scale AI systems can lead to improved transparency and accountability. One possible model is the environmental, social and governance framework. An AI equivalent could involve impact assessments throughout the AI life cycle and detailed explanations of how AI systems function. Once shared standards have been established, certification could shift from voluntary to mandatory reporting supported by measures for enforcement (figure 14).

Governments can also collaborate with the private sector through public\u2013private partnerships to expedite the development of digital public infrastructure (DPI) for AI in local innovation ecosystems. Tailored DPI systems can offer essential resources and services, to support AI adoption and development (figure 15). Figure 15 Developing digital public infrastructure for AI Source: UNCTAD.

The international community can benefit from coordinating and harmonizing the valuable but fragmented open-source AI resources worldwide. The use of connected and interoperable repositories with common standards can enhance the global knowledge base and improve access through trusted hubs that ensure quality and security. \u0007A global hub \u2013 An AI-focused centre and network, modelled after the United Nations Climate Technology Centre and Network, can function as a global hub for building AI capacity, facilitating technology transfer and coordinating technical assistance to developing countries. \u0007South\u2013South collaboration \u2013 Strengthening South\u2013South cooperation in science and technology can enhance the capacity of developing countries to address common AI challenges. Existing mechanisms can be used to exchange AI technologies, data and services and to facilitate the sharing and coordination of AI frameworks and policies. For example, provisions for AI technology and services could be included in trade agreements. Regional institutions can assist in sharing best practices and developing coherent AI policies. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development \u2013 UNCTAD \u2013 is the leading body of the United Nations focused on trade and development. UNCTAD works to ensure developing countries benefit more fairly from a globalized economy by providing research and analysis on trade and development issues, offering technical assistance and facilitating intergovernmental consensus-building. Standing at 195 countries, its membership is one of the largest in the United Nations system.

Under this item the Commission had before it document E/ECE/1514 providing a report on the activities and the main achievements of the Executive Committee since the last Commission session. 21. The Russian Federation inquired why annex IV had been included in E/ECE/1515, as Commission decision A (70), which this annex referenced, did not contain a request to report on activities carried out in Ukraine at the seventy-first session of the Commission. 22. The Chair explained that decision A (70) requested ECE subsidiary bodies to implement it. As these bodies all reported to the Executive Committee during the intersessional period, including on their activities in Ukraine, these activities had been reflected in E/ECE/1515. 23. The Commission noted the initiatives taken during the intersessional period to reflect on future challenges for the ECE, and requested that the Executive Secretary continue consultations with member States on ways to enhance the agility and efficiency of ECE.

Several delegations opposed the amendments proposed by the United States of America and supported the original version as contained in E/ECE/1516. 28. On behalf of Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Malta, Netherlands (Kingdom of the), Norway, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Moldova, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland , the representative of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland called to vote on the adoption of the am",

Following the rejection of the proposed amendments, the Commission considered decision A in its original version as contained in E/ECE/1516. 32. The representative of the United States of America stated that the United States of America did not support the decision, as it sought to focus the work of ECE on climate policy at the expense of other critical issues in the mandate of ECE.

The representative of the European Union and its member States supported the decision. 34.

Several delegations reiterated the importance of references to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Sustainable Development Goals, the Pact for the Future and the Paris Agreement, but voiced a willingness to support the simplified texts as contained in the amendments proposed by the United States of America given the importance of E/2025/37 E/ECE/1512 5 transferring the programme budget requests to United Nations Headquarters, and in the spirit of consensus. 40. The representative of the Russian Federation recalled that the amendments had not been circulated to member States in all working languages of ECE according to the deadlines stipulated in the Rules of Procedure of the Commission, but expressed willingness to make an exception given the importance of approving decisions C and D by consensus. 41. Following the adoption by consensus of the amendments, the Commission adopted decisions C and D, as amended, without a vote. 42. In relation to decision E, the representative of the United States of America did not support the draft decision as contained in E/ECE/1516, as it sought to increase funds significantly for a project that should not require this level of resources. 43.",

E/2025/37 E/ECE/1512 13 Annex I Item 1: Opening and adoption of the agenda Chair\u2019s summary of the discussions Ms. Tatiana Molcean, Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Europe (ECE), welcomed delegates and looked forward to their discussions about national policies and actions for making infrastructure more climate-resilient. An ongoing liquidity crisis in the United Nations Secretariat was threatening mandate delivery, and shifting perspectives and approaches had arisen among member States regarding some of the core ECE mandates. ECE would face these challenges by establishing appropriate priorities and becoming more efficient and nimble, in line with the broader UN80 initiative announced by the Secretary-General. Following the adoption of the agenda, the Commission heard opening remarks as follows: Mr. Alexandre Fasel, Chair of ECE, emphasized the critical importance of resilient infrastructure, which was vital to everyday life. Climate change presented significant threats to infrastructure. Designing climate-resilient infrastructure was therefore essential. ECE, with its eight subprogrammes, was well-equipped to reflect and act on these issues. Ongoing activities already offered valuable opportunities for further policy development.

Designing climate-resilient infrastructure was therefore essential. ECE, with its eight subprogrammes, was well-equipped to reflect and act on these issues. Ongoing activities already offered valuable opportunities for further policy development. The high- level segment of the session would provide a platform to discuss actions, challenges, and opportunities, focusing on how ECE can best support national efforts to build climate- resilient infrastructure. Ms. Tatiana Valovaya, Director-General, United Nations Office at Geneva, noted the relevance of the theme of the high-level segment to the Pact for the Future, which called for accelerated action to address climate change while emphasizing resilient infrastructure as an important element of sustainable development. The international community needed to decisively limit long-term warming. Multilateralism was indispensable in this context, with institutions such as ECE providing platforms for translating the global goals into reality. By setting shared norms, ECE enabled countries to reduce risk and attract green finance, and fostered cross-border cooperation. Item 2: High-level Dialogue Chair\u2019s summary of the discussions The item was moderated by Mr. Alexandre Fasel, Chair of ECE. To open the discussion, Ms. Tatiana Molcean, Executive Secretary of ECE, noted the tremendous opportunity that infrastructure transformation presented for building resilience, accelerating decarbonization and enabling sustainable growth. Numerous ECE instruments supported these objectives. The following issues merited further consideration: better understanding of the potential climate impacts on infrastructure; identification of risks that undermine resilience; sharing of information across stakeholders; technical assistance to ensure broad adoption of relevant ECE standards and guidelines; integrated, cross-sectoral approaches; involvement of multiple governance levels, and innovative mechanisms to finance climate-resilient infrastructure projects. Several delegations welcomed the choice of \u201cClimate action and resilient infrastructure for a sustainable future\u201d as the theme of the session, highlighted the urgency of adapting to and mitigating the impacts of climate change, and underlined the critical role of resilient infrastructure in this context. Several delegations also highlighted the need to enhance international cooperation and multilateralism and agreed that ECE, as a multi- stakeholder convening platform, had an important role to play. E/2025/37 E/ECE/1512 14 Statements Mr. Khojamyrat Geldimyradov, Deputy Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers of Turkmenistan, stated that the National Strategy on Climate Change focused on adaptation measures and reducing emissions. Turkmenistan had joined the Global Methane Pledge, established an intersectoral commission to reduce methane emissions, and was working with international partners on this topic. Adaptation measures included forest restoration, improved land use, creation of green belts around cities, water-saving irrigation methods, and participation in the ECE Trees in Cities initiative. Turkmenistan supported efforts to solve issues in the Aral Sea basin. Electric transport was being promoted in Turkmen cities to enhance decarbonization. Mr. Damjan \u0106ulafi\u0107, Minister for Ecology, Sustainable Development and Development of the Northern Region of Montenegro, said that resilient infrastructure that could withstand the challenges of climate change, combined with increased use of renewable energy and green technologies, was essential for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). With a view to transitioning to a low-carbon, sustainable society, Montenegro had invested significantly in energy infrastructure, achieving better energy efficiency, emission reductions, and implementation of advanced, cleaner technologies. With proper financing, cross-sectoral approaches could be enhanced. Montenegro would continue to strengthen its regulatory framework to attract additional investments in green projects. Mr. Wopke Hoekstra, European Commissioner for Climate, Net Zero and Clean Growth, stated in a video message that climate-resilient infrastructure was crucial for reducing emissions and preparing for ever growing climate risks. The Preparedness Union Strategy of the European Union (EU) therefore emphasized \"resilient by design\" infrastructure. The EU Mission on Adaptation to Climate Change supported regional and local efforts, as cooperation at all levels was essential.",

The Preparedness Union Strategy of the European Union (EU) therefore emphasized \"resilient by design\" infrastructure. The EU Mission on Adaptation to Climate Change supported regional and local efforts, as cooperation at all levels was essential. Despite geopolitical challenges, in particular the Russian aggression against Ukraine, the EU remained committed to climate action, investing up to \u20ac300 billion in smart, clean infrastructure globally through the Global Gateway strategy, in SDG-aligned projects. Ms. Bogl\u00e1rka Ill\u00e9s, State Secretary for Bilateral Relations, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Hungary, recalled that Hungary was chairing the Protocol on Water and Health. Hungary had seen a strong reduction in carbon emissions since 1990 and sought to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. In this context, nuclear energy contributed to carbon reduction. Hungary was also at the forefront of solar power plant production as part of a successful renewable energy production policy. Mr. Zdenko Luci\u0107, State Secretary for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation, Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs of Croatia, noted that Croatia was eighth in the world on SDG implementation based on the 2024 Sustainable Development report. Croatia supported the Pact for the Future, the Paris Agreement and the EU Green Deal. Croatia had adopted strategies for climate change adaptation and disaster risk management, was pursuing efforts to analyse cross-border risks, and had established a climate change adaptation centre. Investments in resilience were crucial. Given the interconnected nature of infrastructure and the cross-border spillover effects of climate change, international cooperation remained paramount. Mr. Elnur Aliyev, First Deputy Minister of Economy of Azerbaijan, delivered a joint statement on behalf of Georgia, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, T\u00fcrkiye, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Azerbaijan. The Trans-Caspian International East-West Transport Corridor (Middle Corridor) has strong potential for connecting European and Asian markets. In the context of rising global demand for diverse supply chains, ensuring efficient and safe operation of the Middle Corridor was crucial. Participating countries would continue to coordinate investments and harmonize procedures for the success of the corridor. The Middle Corridor Group consisting of respective Permanent Missions in Geneva has been established to support this endeavour. Mr. Arman Kassenov, Vice Minister of National Economy of Kazakhstan, said that construction of the first nuclear power plant in the country would significantly change the national energy profile. The Carbon Neutrality Strategy until 2060 emphasized renewable E/2025/37 E/ECE/1512 15 energy development, electric vehicles, natural gas, and sustainable agriculture production. Kazakhstan was integrating green economy principles into regional and national infrastructure plans, and developing infrastructure for artificial intelligence. A recent General Assembly resolution decided to establish a United Nations Regional Centre for the Sustainable Development Goals for Central Asia and Afghanistan in Almaty. Kazakhstan would host the United Nations Regional Climate Summit in 2026. Ms. Fatma Varank, Deputy Minister of Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change of T\u00fcrkiye, said that energy efficient buildings, green infrastructure investments and sustainable transportation solutions were cornerstones of the national Long-Term Climate Change Strategy. Relevant efforts included increasing renewable and nuclear energy use, climate-resilient building standards, railway electrification, increasing the share of railways in logistics, recycling, investments in disaster risk reduction and early warning and forecasting systems, and national- and provincial-level emission tracking. T\u00fcrkiye hosted the Regional Activity Centre for Climate Change under the Barcelona Convention and hoped to host the thirty-first Conference of the Parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change. T\u00fcrkiye aligned with the statement made by Azerbaijan and emphasized that this initiative would be complementary with past and ongoing efforts, including through the Coordination Committee established at the ECE Working Party on Transport Trends and Economics ECE. Mr. Sanzhar Bolotov, Deputy Minister of Economy and Commerce of Kyrgyzstan, stated that Kyrgyzstan saw the green economy as both a necessity and a path to sustainable growth and improved living standards.",

T\u00fcrkiye aligned with the statement made by Azerbaijan and emphasized that this initiative would be complementary with past and ongoing efforts, including through the Coordination Committee established at the ECE Working Party on Transport Trends and Economics ECE. Mr. Sanzhar Bolotov, Deputy Minister of Economy and Commerce of Kyrgyzstan, stated that Kyrgyzstan saw the green economy as both a necessity and a path to sustainable growth and improved living standards. Key initiatives included reducing carbon emissions, promoting sustainable energy (especially hydropower), green farming, soil preservation, and waste management. Kyrgyzstan was developing green taxonomy to attract investment into green economy sectors, and was well-placed to develop ecotourism. While facing challenges from the disposal of batteries from electric vehicles, Kyrgyzstan was committed to international cooperation and contributing to regional and global green initiatives. Mr. Ivan Gospodinov, Director, United Nations and Global Affairs Directorate, Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Bulgaria, acknowledged ECE as a key partner in promoting sustainable infrastructure. Strengthened cooperation, increased financial investments and integration of climate resilience into early-stage planning were crucial. The National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy set resilience targets and assessed climate risks in infrastructure projects. Bulgaria designated climate-neutral zones in major cities, promoted eco-friendly construction, and expanded protected green areas. Efforts towards sustainable, resilient transport infrastructure aligned with the Trans-European Transport Network objectives. Special attention was paid to disaster prevention and resilience, addressing floods and drinking water shortages. Ms. Katrin Saarsalu-Layachi, Special Envoy for Climate and Energy Policy, Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Estonia, said Estonia was accelerating clean technology deployment towards climate neutrality. National strategies integrated climate resilience, with local governments playing key roles in implementation. Sustainable buildings, energy efficiency, and safe transportation of goods were key focus areas. Estonia prioritized digitalization of transport and logistics, leading projects such as eFTI4EU to streamline international trade. Tallinn and Tartu were developing smart city models, integrating renewable energy into building retrofits, and using biogas in public transport. Estonia supported ECE efforts on green and sustainable reconstruction in Ukraine. Mr. Konrad Kiedrzy\u0144ski, Deputy Director of the Global Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Poland, stated that Poland supported infrastructure development and disaster risk reduction projects through its development cooperation and the European Union. The Three Seas Initiative promoted regional cooperation to accelerate development of cross-border energy, transport, and digital infrastructure. Poland had initiated the 2023 General Assembly resolution \u201cBuilding global resilience and promoting sustainable development through regional and interregional infrastructure connectivity\u201d and promoted resilient infrastructure in the Economic and Social Council. Relevant efforts should rely on green technology and take into account communities at risk of exclusion. E/2025/37 E/ECE/1512 16 Mr. Martin Lutz, Head of the Division of Development Policy, Agricultural Policy, United Nations and International Development Banks, Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action of Germany, stressed the need for infrastructure renewal, also in light of devastating floods and a bridge collapse in Germany. A risk-informed approach to planning and building infrastructure was crucial. Infrastructure must not harm natural resources such as clean water. Europe should lead the way on resilient energy grids and modern building standards. Public-private partnerships could play a key role in bringing in the know-how of the private sector in retrofitting and renewing infrastructure. Mr. Gennady Gatilov, Ambassador and Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation, said the Russian Federation aimed for carbon neutrality by 2060, with 85 per cent of its energy mix already coming from renewable or low-emission sources. The large forest surface presented opportunities for decarbonization. Through public-private partnerships, infrastructure was being modernized and made more climate-resilient. Adaptation measures implemented included energy efficiency, waste recycling, urban greening, effective water management, reforestation, environmental monitoring and early warning systems.",

The large forest surface presented opportunities for decarbonization. Through public-private partnerships, infrastructure was being modernized and made more climate-resilient. Adaptation measures implemented included energy efficiency, waste recycling, urban greening, effective water management, reforestation, environmental monitoring and early warning systems. The politically motivated decisions adopted in gross violation of the Commission's mandate and Rules of Procedure, aimed at restricting the participation of Russia and Belarus in ECE activities, have significantly weakened its resource and expert potential. The responsibility for this laid entirely with the countries blinded by Russophobia, particularly the EU. Mr. Paul Bekkers, Ambassador and Permanent Representative of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, noted the impact of rising sea levels in the Netherlands and the urgent need to address climate change through global cooperation, including private sector involvement. The Paris Agreement formed a strong foundation for adaptation to climate change. Resilient infrastructure, particularly water resilience, was crucial for the Kingdom of the Netherlands as rising seas, extreme rainfall, and droughts strain systems. Innovations like heat-resistant bridges and roads with built-in water storages are key. The Kingdom of the Netherlands valued its role as Chair of the ECE Inland Transport Committee. Mr. Vladimir Cuc, Ambassador and Permanent Representative of the Republic of Moldova, noted that the Republic of Moldova was extremely climate vulnerable and faced risks to its water resources due to extreme weather events. The country was committed to reducing its carbon footprint, transitioning to renewable energy and investing in sustainable practices, in line with its new national road map for infrastructure resilience. European Union accession was a priority, alongside increasing forested areas and achieving climate neutrality by 2050. While appreciating the readiness of ECE to continue raising efficiency, the Republic of Moldova expressed concerns about the financial constraints that ECE is facing, as these limitations could hinder its ability to effectively support member States, including countries going through the challenge of the war unleashed against them, such as Ukraine. The Republic of Moldova also called for enhanced dialogue and cooperation among Geneva- based economic agencies. Mr. Yevheniy Tsymbaliuk, Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Ukraine, said that the damage caused by the Russian Federation on Ukrainian infrastructure and environment would undermine resilience for generations. The resulting impacts affected trade, energy and food security in the region. ECE played a critical role in supporting green and resilient recovery in Ukraine. A just and lasting peace was necessary for a sustainable future. Ukraine called on member States to support draft decision E/ECE/2025/L.1 that would be discussed under agenda item 7. Ms. Anita Pipan, Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Slovenia, underscored the economic costs of inaction on climate change. Mitigation and adaptation strategies are needed for climate-resilient infrastructure. The circular economy supported mitigation by promoting material reuse and extending infrastructure lifespans. Adaptation required incorporating climate projections into planning and designing for resilience and sustainability. A new national Center for Climate Change will update projections and support such planning. The Regional Office for Climate Change supports local-level adaptation. Slovenia valued the contributions of ECE, particularly those of the Water Convention on sustainable water management. E/2025/37 E/ECE/1512 17 Mr. Darius Staniulis, Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Lithuania, called for a holistic, inclusive and comprehensive approach and multistakeholder collaboration at all governance levels. The long-term goal of Lithuania is energy independence and generating all energy from renewable sources. Lithuania was developing a national hydrogen ecosystem and investing in infrastructure, including the Nordic-Baltic Hydrogen Corridor. The Rail Baltica infrastructure project is an example of dual-use and climate-resilient regional infrastructure project that contributes to both regional security and environmental objectives. Lithuania called on the international community to address the enormous damage caused by Russia in its war of aggression against Ukraine.",

Lithuania called on the international community to address the enormous damage caused by Russia in its war of aggression against Ukraine. Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine has caused repercussions on the environment, transport infrastructure, global development, energy security, and nuclear safety all over the world, not just in the ECE region. Russia must be made accountable for the consequences of its actions. Ms. Hasmik Tolmajian, Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Armenia, acknowledged the role of ECE in assisting member States to implement the Sustainable Development Goals. Empowering women by enhancing their access to digital technologies could unleash their potential for innovation. As host of the seventeenth Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity in 2026, Armenia highlighted the need to address biodiversity loss. Armenia stressed the potential of the Crossroads of Peace initiative to foster regional cooperation on multiple fronts, including to ensure a secure future and green and resilient infrastructure development for the benefit of the whole region. Ms. D\u00e9sir\u00e9e Schweitzer, Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Austria, said Austria addressed transport infrastructure resilience in strategic planning and had implemented adaptation measures such as hazard maps and hazard management systems for motorways and railways. GeoSphere Austria supported assessment of the climate vulnerabilities of infrastructure. The Action Programme Danube 2030 promoted flood protection systems and improvements in navigability. Austria supported the G20 Principles for Quality Infrastructure Investment. Mr. Erwin Bollinger, Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Switzerland, said reducing carbon emissions in transport, housing, energy, and industry was critical for the region. Developing resilient infrastructure required strong private sector involvement. ECE work on public-private partnerships should be reinforced. Innovative financing of infrastructures was crucial. Dialogue should be encouraged among all stakeholders to promote innovation for sustainable development. Local government participation was also key. The ECE Forum of Mayors was a unique platform that should be strengthened and broadened. Ms. Vasilika Hysi, Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Albania, noted that hydropower had reduced emissions from energy production in Albania to almost zero. Nevertheless, given the vulnerability of hydropower to climate change, Albania was diversifying into solar, wind and other renewable energies. Establishing the first European Wild River National Park around the Vjosa River had promoted sustainable tourism and created employment, demonstrating the transformative power of nature-based solutions. Albania was enhancing early warning systems to protect vulnerable populations. Mr. Andrew Jackson, Ambassador of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the United Nations Economic Agencies, said that well-constructed, appropriately designed and well-maintained climate-resilient infrastructure was critical for achieving climate goals. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland welcomed the contributions of ECE to the Early Warning for All initiative. The Centre of Expertise in Green Cities, Infrastructure and Energy had delivered green infrastructure projects in 25 countries. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland supported the Coalition for Climate Resilient Investment. British International Investment de-risked institutional investment and supported reconstruction in Ukraine. The United Kingdom urged ECE member States to stand with Ukraine, who suffered from widespread destruction of infrastructure by the Russian Federation. E/2025/37 E/ECE/1512 18 Mr. Sharaf Sheralizoda, Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Tajikistan, recalled longstanding promotion by Tajikistan of the water and climate agenda at the global level. Tajikistan generated 98 per cent of its electricity from hydropower and planned to fully transition to renewable energy by 2032. Recognizing the critical role of glaciers in the regional climate balance, Tajikistan had spearheaded the declaration of 2025 as the International Year of Glacier Preservation. Electric vehicles were being promoted via tax incentives. Tajikistan was committed to electrifying all public transport. Ms.",

Ms. Joana Fisher, Deputy Permanent Representative of Portugal, highlighted the importance of long-term planning, strategic foresight, and early identification of emerging risks. Portugal was committed to carbon neutrality by 2050. The transition should encompass whole-of-government and whole-of-society efforts in order to leave no one behind, and local authorities must be empowered. Ms. Melanie Zimmerman, Acting Deputy Chief of the United States of America Mission to the United Nations, called for an end to the war in Ukraine. The United States of America advocated for a course correction on climate ideology and rejected the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals, finding them inconsistent with the sovereignty of nations. The United States of America sought a return to the original vision of the United Nations as a place for cooperation where countries could protect their sovereignty and security and promote their prosperity. ECE should not further expend valuable resources on negotiations that revolved around past resolutions and agreements. A statement in exercise of the right of reply was made by the representative of the Russian Federation. Wrapping up the discussions, the Executive Secretary expressed gratitude for the insightful contributions from delegations and the support for ECE. Increased digitalization and innovation would be essential to advance the mission of ECE. The organization continued to provide expertise on its core mandate of economic cooperation and integration. There were numerous opportunities to move forward with the actions presented, leveraging ECE strengths in standardization and policy development. Building synergies with other Geneva-based organizations would be key to maximizing shared expertise and driving collective progress. E/2025/37 E/ECE/1512 19 Annex II Item 3: Roundtables Chair\u2019s summary of the discussions A roundtable was held on the theme of \u201cAdvancing climate action and resilient infrastructure\u201d, which highlighted perspectives from member States and discussed scaling up ECE initiatives for climate action and resilient infrastructure and deepening collaboration with project financiers. The roundtable was moderated by Mr. Dario Liguti, Director of the ECE Sustainable Energy Division. In a keynote statement, Mr. Mahmoud Mohieldin, United Nations Special Envoy on Financing the 2030 Agenda, emphasized the critical intersection of nature, climate, and development amid international finance and trade challenges. Regional partnerships and collaboration were crucial in view of the issues to be discussed at the upcoming Fourth International Conference on Financing for Development. These included improving resource mobilization, optimizing investments in sustainability, and maintaining the integrity of the multilateral system. Official development assistance remained important for de-risking and capacity building. He encouraged better integration of financing for nature, climate and development through the Nationally Determined Contributions. Opening the roundtable, Mr. Dmitry Mariyasin, Deputy Executive Secretary of ECE, said that first, financing resilient infrastructure required viable, risk-based models for engaging the private sector at scale. This had to be supported by a strong dialogue with public (international finance institutions) and private (capital markets) financiers alike, to ensure resilience became part of investment projects by design. ECE had successfully supported the development of such models under its various work areas, for example through the Water Convention and the work on PPPs. Second, quality data needs to underpin development of resilient infrastructure. ECE was also leveraging technology for risk assessment and evidence-based planning, for example through the International Transport Infrastructure Observatory which hosted geographic information data on transport infrastructure networks and nodes across various modes. Third, it is key to consider social aspects of resilient infrastructure, addressed, for example, by the ECE Water and Health Protocol, and citizen involvement, for example, through the mechanisms of the Aarhus Convention.

Third, it is key to consider social aspects of resilient infrastructure, addressed, for example, by the ECE Water and Health Protocol, and citizen involvement, for example, through the mechanisms of the Aarhus Convention. Mr. Arman Kassenov, Vice Minister of National Economy, Kazakhstan, stated that the National Infrastructure Plan included 204 projects, evaluated for economic feasibility, climate resilience, and cross-border connectivity. A parliamentary commission for sustainable development had been established. Kazakhstan benefited from ECE platforms such as the Water Convention, the Forum of Mayors and the Group of Experts on Coal Mine Methane and Just Transition. A national Emissions Trading System helped move towards convergence with corresponding European Union mechanisms. Kazakhstan was expanding multi-level climate governance, empowering local regions and promoting private sector participation in decarbonization. Conducting a third ECE Environmental Performance Review was of interest. Kazakhstan invited all international partners to work with the recently established Multi-Partner Trust Fund under the United Nations Special Programme for the Economies of Central Asia (SPECA). Ms. Fatma Varank, Deputy Minister of Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change, Chief Negotiator for Climate Change, T\u00fcrkiye, emphasized that fast, accessible, diverse, and concessional financing was crucial for building climate-resilient and sustainable infrastructure. Well-structured and responsibly implemented public-private partnerships (PPPs) offered effective mechanisms for mobilizing private sector resources while fostering innovation. Enhancing the role of development banks was important. In this respect, systematic integration of ECE technical standards, guidelines, and other tools into the frameworks of multilateral development banks would accelerate the transformation, enabling E/2025/37 E/ECE/1512 20 the identification of gaps, the development of financing and investment solutions, and the strengthening of international cooperation. Mr. Sanzhar Bolotov, Deputy Minister of Economy and Commerce of Kyrgyzstan, said that infrastructure projects should ensure \u201cvalue for money\u201d, \u201cvalue for people\u201d and \u201cvalue for the planet\u201d, generating immediate and longer-term net benefits for all stakeholders. PIERS had been a game changer, enabling Kyrgyzstan to develop finance- ready resilient infrastructure projects. The United Nations Special Programme for the Economies of Central Asia (SPECA) also played an important role in fostering joint action. They recently launched the SPECA Multi-Partner Trust Fund aimed to strengthen connectivity across the Trans-Caspian transport and trade corridor and promote digitalization and innovation for the green economy. Additionally, ECE was an ideal platform to explore impact investment for resilient infrastructure from a public policy perspective. Ms. Hannie Meesters, Chair of the ECE Inland Transport Committee (ITC), highlighted the Model Rules on the Permanent Identification of Railway Rolling Stock and Convention on the International Contract of Carriage of Goods by Rail as new ECE instruments promoting sustainable transport, in line with other ITC efforts to decarbonize and climate-proof the sector. The ITC Decarbonization Strategy provided a comprehensive framework. The ITC had also developed strategic guidance on areas key for investment decisions, such as evaluating transport system resilience and adaptation pathways for transport professionals. Integrating such ITC instruments and tools in investment planning could complement efforts by financiers. Ms. Elisabete Quintas da Silva, Chair of the ECE Committee on Environmental Policy, said that the Committee was developing a region-wide approach for assessing infrastructure vulnerability to extreme weather. This would complement existing ECE tools, including the Espoo Convention, the Industrial Accidents Convention, the Protocol on Strategic Environmental Assessment, the Water Convention and the Environmental Performance Reviews. It involves a common framework with a system of indicators for measuring and monitoring risks, leveraging advanced technology such as data analytics and artificial intelligence. Reaping the expected benefits from ECE instruments requires developing new innovative financing mechanisms to bridge the significant gap facing governments. Mr.",

Reaping the expected benefits from ECE instruments requires developing new innovative financing mechanisms to bridge the significant gap facing governments. Mr. George Katapodis, Chair of the ECE Committee on Innovation, Competitiveness and Public-Private Partnerships, highlighted the ECE Public-Private Partnership Infrastructure Evaluation and Rating System (PIERS) and the ECE Transformative Innovation Network (ETIN) as flagship tools that supported resilient infrastructure. PIERS helped governments assess infrastructure projects for technical feasibility as well as impact on social inclusion, resilience, economic effectiveness and fiscal sustainability. ETIN brought together innovation policymakers from across the region for peer learning and co-creation of solutions that support systems-level transformation. The Committee further worked on innovation-enhancing public procurement, which could unlock solutions for more agile, inclusive and sustainable infrastructure. Ms. Margalita Arabidze, Chair of the ECE Committee on Sustainable Energy, mentioned ECE instruments such as the United Nations Framework Classification for Resources, the United Nations Resource Management System, the Carbon Neutrality Toolkit, and the High Performance Buildings Principles, which supported a secure, affordable, environmentally sustainable and resilient energy system. Cross-sector and cross-border cooperation was crucial. Investments needed to increase significantly, and also address all regions of the world. ECE worked with the United Nations High Level Climate Champions to provide financial solutions to critical transition issues and offered a space for project sponsors and financiers to meet. Mr. Damjan \u0106ulafi\u0107, Minister of Ecology, Sustainable Development, and Northern Region Development of Montenegro, noted the need to reduce dependence on seasonal and coastal tourism to protect the sector from the impacts of climate change. Modernizing agricultural infrastructure would enhance resilience and enable stable food production. Strategically redefined land management policies would support sustainable development. New meteorological and hydrological stations with trained personnel would E/2025/37 E/ECE/1512 21 improve response to climate hazards. Development of road infrastructure would improve rural-urban connectivity. Investments in renewable energy, and sustainable transport and modernization of existing facilities would reduce emissions. Public-private partnerships, international climate funds, bilateral assistance, international financial institutions and European Union funds were all important pillars of financing. Ms. Carmen Mart\u00ednez, Counselor at the Permanent Mission of Spain, said that in order to ensure that the climate resilience was part of the design and development of infrastructures, reliable and timely data for informed decision-making was essential. The development and production of climate change related statistics should respond to policy needs and provide relevant information on issues such as disaster risk-related indicators. Ms. Araksya Babikyan, Department of Development Cooperation and Multilateral Policy, Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Armenia, said that effective resilience and adaptation strategies, with sufficient and predictable means of implementation, were paramount. Armenia was investing in green and resilient infrastructure solutions, transport and digital connectivity, water management and ecosystem restoration. Armenia prioritized the development of economically viable and technically available renewable energy sources to ensure energy independence and security, and promoted electric vehicles. Reforestation campaigns, stricter regulations on illegal logging, and eco-tourism initiatives benefited the forest sector. Armenia was also enhancing energy efficiency in the building sector. Mr. Ivan Gospodinov, Director, United Nations and Global Affairs Directorate, Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Bulgaria, said that public-private partnerships and innovative financial mechanisms such as green bonds and blended finance were crucial to bridge the climate finance gap. ECE could facilitate access to international climate funds such as the Green Climate Fund and the Adaptation Fund. Bulgaria planned to mobilize \u20ac3.2 billion for its green transition, including activities to promote the use of hydrogen technologies.",

The Executive Board approved the provisional agenda and workplan for the second regular session of 2025, to be held on 9 and 10 September 2025 (UNW/2025/CRP.2). 2.

After opening the annual session and welcoming the Under-Secretary- General/Executive Director, UN-Women colleagues and delegates, the President of the Executive Board touched upon the recent Executive Board field visit to Zimbabwe and expressed her sincere appreciation to the Government and people of Zimbabwe, the UN-Women Country Office, and the Executive Board Secretariat for their hospitality, support and thorough preparations that contributed to a successful visit. She outlined the different reports and briefings to be presented during the first regular session, and the decisions to be negotiated. 4. In her opening statement, the Under-Secretary-General/Executive Director thanked the President for her strong leadership and expressed her appreciation to the Vice-Presidents for their steadfast support to UN-Women. She congratulated the Bureau for their successful field visit to Zimbabwe and thanked UN-Women colleagues who work every day to advance women\u2019s rights and empowerment. Noting that the annual session is taking place at a time when global peace is fragile and the promise of gender equality hangs in the balance, she expressed hope for a future where peace prevails, and the rights and dignity of every woman and girl are fully __________________ 1 Note: The present document was processed in its entirety by UN-Women.

She emphasized that Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5 is the great enabler for every other SDG, but noted that only two indicators under SDG 5 are nearing their targets, while the remaining 12 remain off track. Highlighting the Beijing+30 high-level meeting in September 2025, the Head of the Entity mentioned that UN-Women is supporting Member States, civil society and women\u2019s movements to translate the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action into tangible progress towards gender equality. She highlighted that at the sixty-ninth session of the Commission on the Status of Women, Member States adopted a strong political declaration reaffirming the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and its relevance, which sent the powerful message that even in a polarized world, the United Nations can come together for women and girls. The Under-Secretary- General/Executive Director added that the upcoming fourth International Conference on Financing for Development in Seville presents a critical opportunity to renew commitments and scale up investments in gender equality. She added that in 2024, contributions to UN-Women rose to $593 million, and thanked donors for their commitment to the Entity\u2019s mandate and trust in UN-Women. She noted that the Entity is acutely aware of today\u2019s funding realities, and is making tough cost containment decisions and planning for different scenarios. The Head of the Entity stressed that UN-Women shall continue to work on ensuring greater efficiencies, reducing costs, exploring cost-sharing with sister agencies, and becoming more focused and streamlined. She shared that the Pivoting to Regions and Countries initiative has given UN-Women an advantage, noting that the Entity will reduce its New York footprint by 33 per cent by the end of 2026. 5. Discussing her annual report, the Under-Secretary-General/Executive Director shared that it reflects a story of real, measurable, hard-earned progress, with UN- Women working in 109 countries and territories and investing over $622 million to advance gender equality in 2024.",

Discussing her annual report, the Under-Secretary-General/Executive Director shared that it reflects a story of real, measurable, hard-earned progress, with UN- Women working in 109 countries and territories and investing over $622 million to advance gender equality in 2024. Sharing more results across four impact areas, she added that 325 laws have been adopted, revised or appealed to advance and protect women\u2019s rights, nearly $220 million has been channelled to civil society, and across 71 countries, political inclusion and legal reforms have been supported to open more doors to women\u2019s leadership. She further highlighted that UN-Women supported 60 disability-inclusive projects and worked with 70 governments in debt-stressed economies to prioritize gender in budgeting and transform care systems. UN-Women contributed to humanitarian response through its membership in the Inter-Agency Standing Committee and has maintained a presence on the ground, collaborating with women\u2019s organizations in conflict and crisis-affected areas such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gaza, Haiti, Myanmar, Sudan, Ukraine and beyond. This was achieved while improving transparency, governance and agility as a United Nations entity. She welcomed the latest Multilateral Organization Performance Assessment Network review, which affirmed UN-Women's strong performance across management, results and organizational effectiveness, reflecting growing partner trust. 6. Looking ahead to the next Strategic Plan 2026\u20132029, the Head of the Entity underscored that this new Strategic Plan provides an opportunity to consolidate progress, sharpen focus and apply lessons learned from the midterm review. The next Strategic Plan will be grounded in international agreements such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the Women, Peace and Security agenda, and will reflect the voices of Member States, civil society, youth, the private sector and United Nations partners, while remaining firmly anchored in UN-Women\u2019s triple mandate to ensure that ambition translates into delivery. The Under-Secretary- General/Executive Director then discussed UN80 and shared that UN-Women is fully engaged in this process, co-coordinating the United Nations system Development UNW/2025/6 3/22 25-12751 Cluster and actively contributing to the peace and security, humanitarian and human rights clusters. She emphasized that any credible reform must have women\u2019s rights and empowerment at its core, cautioning that reforms lacking a gender perspective are destined to fail. Although there are various approaches to organizing the United Nations system\u2019s work, effective delivery on gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment by the United Nations system requires a strong gender equality entity with a broad triple mandate that is equipped to add value across the system, supports critical intergovernmental processes, delivers for women and girls in countries, and drives system-wide coherence through cost-effective coordination. She concluded by expressing pride in the results presented, noting that the achievements reflect the value of UN-Women\u2019s mandate, transparency and collaboration. She acknowledged the difficult times ahead and affirmed that while UN-Women cannot offer more with fewer resources, it is committed to delivering better through greater coordination, sharper focus and seizing the opportunities presented by system-wide reform. 7. Upon opening the floor, numerous Member States thanked the Under-Secretary- General/Executive Director for her leadership and expressed appreciation to UN- Women staff worldwide, while reaffirming their support for UN-Women\u2019s triple mandate. Member States welcomed the key results achieved to date under UN- Women\u2019s 2022\u20132025 Strategic Plan and praised its work in 109 countries and territories, recognizing this as a clear reflection of the Entity\u2019s significance and impact. Several delegations emphasized that gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment are essential drivers of sustainable development and reiterated their commitment to the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, while noting that the upcoming Beijng+30 high-level meeting presents an opportunity to accelerate progress for gender equality. Speakers expressed their support for the inclusive and consultative approach of the development of UN-Women\u2019s 2026\u20132029 Strategic Plan and encouraged the new plan to be focused, ambitious and responsive to realities on the ground.",

While expressing appreciation and acknowledging the importance of UN- Women\u2019s efforts to advance gender equality and the empowerment of women, one speaker emphasized that support to Member States should be provided with their consent and called on UN-Women to strictly adhere to its mandate and to use intergovernmentally agreed language. III. Evaluation 8. The Director of the Independent Evaluation, Audit and Investigation Services (IEAIS) presented the annual report on the evaluation function of UN-Women (UNW/2025/4). The report provides an overview of the performance of the UN- Women evaluation function in 2024. In total, the Independent Evaluation Service (IES) completed three corporate evaluations in the areas of women's political participation and social norms, a synthesis of United Nations system-wide evaluations related to SDG 5 and a formative assessment of the gender equality accelerators. Additionally, three corporate evaluations were in progress (on ending violence against women, sustainable finance and support to women in peace processes), as well as a synthesis of UN-Women\u2019s performance against the Strategic Plan. Fifty evaluations were conducted or in progress at the decentralized level, including 18 strategic evaluations at the country and regional levels, with six of those portfolio evaluations completed. In 2024, corporate evaluation performance indicators remained rated UNW/2025/6 25-12751 4/22 \u201cgood\u201d; however, financial expenditure on evaluation was 1.6 per cent of the total programme expenditure, falling short of the 2 per cent target. Human resources across UN-Women for evaluation and evaluation implementation rates both increased in 2024. Engagement in joint evaluations also increased, accounting for 35 per cent of all evaluations. In terms of evaluation coverage, all but three country offices had at least one evaluation during their strategic note cycles. The Director of IEAIS reported that implementation of management responses fell slightly to 86 per cent following the introduction of a more rigorous monitoring and tracking system. She added that the use of evaluation remains strong, with 90 per cent of offices reporting the use of evaluation to inform strategic planning, strengthen programme approaches and identify new opportunities. She also outlined the IES\u2019 many partnerships, including its engagement in inter-agency humanitarian evaluations and United Nations system- wide evaluations and initiatives to ensure that evaluations incorporate gender equality. The Director concluded by saying that the IES will continue to conduct corporate strategic evaluations, provide technical assistance to decentralized evaluations and build evaluation partnerships in the United Nations system. 9. The Director of IEAIS presented the corporate evaluation on UN-Women's support to women\u2019s participation in the peace process (UNW/2025/CRP.3). The evaluation concluded that since the adoption of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and Security Council resolution 1325, UN-Women has made meaningful contributions to the inclusion of women in the peace process through five core methods: (1) by convening stakeholders; (2) by raising awareness and supporting political commitments; (3) through supporting civil society; (4) by embedding gender equality in institutional frameworks; and (5) through enhancing partnerships. The evaluation found that politically skilled personnel, senior representatives, presence in country, deep contextual knowledge and enabling corporate procedures are critical drivers to deliver and recommended that UN-Women reinforce these areas. 10. Speaking on behalf of management, the Deputy Executive Director expressed appreciation for the IES\u2019 work, highlighting the benefits that its work brings to UN- Women.",

Speaking on behalf of management, the Deputy Executive Director expressed appreciation for the IES\u2019 work, highlighting the benefits that its work brings to UN- Women. She noted the positive trajectory of UN-Women's key performance indicators (KPIs) and the importance of KPIs as tools for tracking progress. She shared that the current evaluations come at a critical time for the Entity, on the anniversaries of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and Security Council resolution 1325, and emphasized the vital role of women\u2019s participation in the peace process in mitigating conflict. 11. A delegation speaking on behalf of 22 Member States thanked the IES for maintaining a high-quality, independent and impactful evaluation function in all results achieved in 2024, for its commitment to working in partnership with gender- responsive evaluations through the United Nations Evaluation Group, system-wide and joint evaluations, and for engaging with the Multilateral Organization Performance Assessment Network. The group encouraged UN-Women to pay close attention to five KPIs that do not appear close to reaching the 2025 targets. The group welcomed the progress in building internal evaluation capacity and requested more details about the evaluation professionalization initiative. The group also welcomed the focus on fewer but more strategic evaluations and wanted to know what could be done to reduce the number of decentralized evaluations. In addition, the group wanted to know how evaluation findings were integrated into the development of the Strategic Plan 2026\u20132029. Lastly, the group requested to know how the IES will be affected by budget cuts and whether these would affect the IES\u2019 2025 programme of work. Another delegation speaking in their national capacity welcomed the thematic evaluation of UN-Women's support of women in peace processes. The delegation agreed with the findings of the evaluation and recognized the need to bolster the capacity of women negotiators. UNW/2025/6 5/22 25-12751 12. In response, the Director of IEAIS thanked Member States for their interventions and emphasized the critical role of oversight and evaluation in fostering integrity, transparency and trust, particularly during reform. She acknowledged the support of Member States in recognizing UN-Women's contributions to peacebuilding and the related importance of evaluation. On the question regarding the professionalization initiative, she explained that her office has been supporting UN-Women personnel in monitoring and evaluation functions to acquire knowledge with e-learning courses, coaching and hands-on support. On how to reduce the number of small-scale evaluations, the Director emphasized that IEAIS has been advocating with management to prioritize strategic evaluations such as country portfolio, thematic and cluster evaluations over smaller-scale efforts for some time. She noted the need for sustained funding to support these initiatives. The Director concluded by stating that despite operating with a lean structure, the IES remains committed to ensuring that evaluations are impactful, well-resourced and effectively integrated into decision- making processes across all levels of UN-Women\u2019s work. The Deputy Executive Director also responded to Member States\u2019 interventions and reaffirmed the Entity\u2019s commitment to integrating social norms into its 2026\u20132029 Strategic Plan, recognizing their foundational influence on legal frameworks, access to services and societal attitudes. The Deputy Executive Director confirmed that the next Strategic Plan is informed by evaluations and learnings on social norms. The Director of the Policy, Programme and Intergovernmental Division acknowledged Member States\u2019 engagement, particularly commending a Member State\u2019s leadership in inclusive peace processes and highlighting the global relevance of its model. She noted that the evaluation of UN-Women\u2019s support for women in peace processes validated the Entity\u2019s contributions and offered critical insights for future programming, reinforcing the importance of inclusive peacebuilding. Furthermore, she detailed how the new Strategic Plan draws from internal evaluations, partner-led assessments, comprehensive analysis and stakeholder feedback. IV.

The Director of the IEAIS presented its report on internal audit and investigation activities for the period of 1 January to 31 December 2024 (UNW/2025/3). The Director confirmed that her office continued to operate independently with the freedom to decide on the scope of its work and that it relies upon UN-Women management to provide resources to deliver its mandate. She shared that in 2024, the Independent Audit Services (IAS) conducted 17 audit and advisory assignments and issued 11 final reports, of which nine were audits with overall opinions assessed. Five entities or processes were assessed as satisfactory and four as partially satisfactory, leading to an overall assessment that UN-Women\u2019s governance, risk management and controls were in aggregate satisfactory, with some areas for improvement. In their annual opinion, the IAS made four overarching observations: (1) further enhancement of management oversight; (2) need for technical capacity at decentralized levels; (3) finalization of the Statement of Internal Controls; and (4) continued vigilance on cybersecurity and data governance. The Pivoting to Regions and Countries initiative was acknowledged as a positive step towards cost-efficiency and impact maximization. The Director shared that the percentage of long-outstanding audit recommendations dropped to 3 per cent, demonstrating improved management responsiveness. The Director shared that in 2024, UN-Women launched a hybrid model for investigations, establishing an independent internal investigation function while continuing to engage the United Nations Office of Internal Oversight (OIOS) as a provider of external investigations. She clarified that OIOS continues to handle intake of all UN-Women complaints and shared that in 2024 it received 76 new allegations of misconduct, reflecting increased awareness and improved reporting UNW/2025/6 25-12751 6/22 mechanisms. Seventy-one cases were closed in 2024, of which 62 were closed after preliminary assessment and nine after full investigation. Of the 62 cases closed after preliminary assessment, 39 cases were referred to IEAIS for consideration on potential action. The Director concluded by stating that the IEAIS will continue to leverage technology and complete an assurance mapping exercise to ensure the best use of oversight resources and to build a strong investigation function that promotes confidence and trust. 14. The incoming Chair of the Advisory Committee on Oversight (ACO) presented the report of the Advisory Committee on Oversight for the period from 1 January to 31 December 2024 (UNW/2025/3/Add.1). The report reviewed the functioning of the Entity\u2019s oversight function, as well as its internal control accountability, including governance, risk management and control systems. Overall, the ACO continued to provide independent, external advice to the Executive Director on governance, accountability and internal control systems, in line with its mandate. The ACO maintained full independence and conducted three in-person meetings in New York and a field visit to Nairobi. The ACO found that oversight functions including internal audit, evaluation, investigation, ethics and the United Nations Board of Auditors delivered valuable results, with notable progress in reducing long-standing audit issues, strengthening evaluation capacity and operationalizing a hybrid investigation model. Notwithstanding these improvements, the Committee emphasized the need for stronger second-line functions and management oversight, and underscored that sustainable funding is needed for both the investigation and ethics functions. The Committee commended UN-Women for receiving an unqualified audit opinion for the thirteenth consecutive year and achieving a 92 per cent implementation rate of audit recommendations. On governance and risk management, the ACO acknowledged strong management commitment to excellence and transformation, but emphasized the need for improved budget allocation, sustained core funding, a robust human resources strategy and continued monitoring of regional initiatives to ensure alignment with strategic goals and timely issue resolution. 15. The Deputy Executive Director expressed appreciation for the work by the ACO, IEAIS and OIOS.",

The Deputy Executive Director expressed appreciation for the work by the ACO, IEAIS and OIOS. She noted that UN-Women has demonstrated significant progress in strengthening internal governance, risk management and accountability, as reflected in the IAS assessment, which rated most audits as satisfactory for the first time, with no audits requiring major improvement for the second consecutive year. The organization reduced long-outstanding audit recommendations to 3 per cent and advanced key initiatives such as the Transparency Portal, Quantum Enterprise Resource Planning enhancements and a new statement of internal controls. She emphasized that UN-Women will continue to prioritize implementation of the key recommendations in cybersecurity, data governance, anti-fraud measures and third- party risk management, aiming for completion in 2025. She also confirmed that the Entity is actively seeking to diversify its donor base and investing in digital transformation. The Deputy Executive Director welcomed the recognition of the Pivoting to Regions and Countries initiative to enhance efficiency and accountability. She underscored that the Entity always prioritizes an ethical organizational culture and noted that the launch of a hybrid investigation model and an 85 per cent increase in ethics service requests underscored growing trust in oversight functions. She added that UN-Women took prompt and appropriate action to implement its approach to misconduct and shared that no disciplinary cases were reported in 2024. She stated that UN-Women was cognizant of the need to identify sustainable resourcing for critical functions, such as human resources and the second line of defence. She concluded by noting that UN-Women remains committed to leveraging oversight insights to build a more agile and accountable organization as it enters its next Strategic Plan 2026\u20132029. UNW/2025/6 7/22 25-12751 16. A delegation speaking on behalf of 17 Member States began its remarks by thanking the ACO and IEAIS for their insightful presentations and for their services in promoting transparency and accountability in the Entity. The group asked how the IEAIS will be affected by ongoing budget changes in UN-Women. The group went on to commend the progress made towards implementing long-outstanding recommendations and encouraged the timely closure of all unclosed recommendations. They also encouraged UN-Women to review the resource situation of the Investigation Service ahead of the new budget for 2026\u20132027. Another delegation in a national capacity requested further details on the findings of the review of the human resources function and how more resources will be allocated to the function. The speaker also asked how resources will be allocated to the Quantum Plus Initiative as well as an update on the finalization of internal controls. 17. In response to Member States\u2019 interventions, the Director of IEAIS emphasized that sustained funding is critical to maintaining delivery capacity. While minor cost savings may be achievable in 2025, prolonged budget reductions would impact future operations. While technological efficiencies are being explored, there is a continued need for field visits to engage directly with UN-Women personnel and partners. The Director highlighted the progress made in establishing an internal investigation function and stressed the importance of securing stable funding for at least two investigation positions in the 2026 budget. She noted that given current budget constraints, the hybrid investigation model remains the most viable and beneficial approach for UN-Women. The Deputy Executive Director responded to interventions from Member States reaffirming that UN-Women remains steadfast in its commitment to strengthening the oversight, ethics and human resources functions despite ongoing financial constraints. She reported that of the 19 outstanding IAS recommendations, two have been closed and the remaining 17 are on track for implementation by the end of 2025. In response to a reduction in regular resources, management is actively reassessing the most effective and cost-efficient modalities for delivering investigation and ethics functions, including through exploring potential partnerships within the United Nations system.",

In response to a reduction in regular resources, management is actively reassessing the most effective and cost-efficient modalities for delivering investigation and ethics functions, including through exploring potential partnerships within the United Nations system. She noted the significant underinvestment in human resources compared with peer entities, which prompted a strategic review and reallocation of resources, including relocating human resources operations to a lower- cost duty station. These efforts underscore UN-Women\u2019s dedication to maintaining robust internal controls and ensuring organizational resilience. She added that management is exploring innovative approaches to balance investments across the second and third lines of defence to safeguard the Entity\u2019s operational integrity. Continued engagement with external experts and internal stakeholders will guide the implementation of critical reforms and ensure alignment with United Nations system- wide best practices. The Director of the Strategy, Planning, Resources and Effectiveness Division (SPRED) responded to the interventions of Member States, adding that UN- Women has included a statement of internal controls over financial reporting in its 2024 financial statements. Concurrently, significant investments are being made to enhance results-based management, including a $2 million allocation for systems development under the 2026\u20132027 integrated budget, aimed at improving corporate planning, system integration and transparency. A planning module is scheduled to launch by January 2026, followed by monitoring and reporting modules later that year, ensuring alignment from strategic planning to project-level implementation. V. Ethics 18. The Ethics Advisor presented the report on the activities of the UN-Women Ethics Function for 2024 (UNW2025/5). She noted that the Ethics Function of UN- Women continued to advance its mandate in 2024 by fostering a culture of ethics, UNW/2025/6 25-12751 8/22 integrity and accountability across the organization. Key achievements included the issuance of the Outside Activities Policy and the revised Protection against Retaliation Policy, which laid critical policy foundations for managing conflicts of interest and safeguarding personnel. These efforts were complemented by extensive outreach and awareness-raising initiatives, including partnership with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Ethics Office and broader inter-agency collaboration. The ethics function delivered training sessions across Headquarters, regional and country offices, with 670 participations, and a 121 per cent increase in advisory requests compared with the previous reporting period. She shared that she received five inquiries under the Protection against Retaliation Policy \u2013 four of which were requests for advice and one for protection \u2013 and that full compliance was achieved in the 2024 United Nations Financial Disclosure Programme. Looking ahead to 2025, she shared that the ethics function will continue to focus on positively influencing the organizational culture through training on ethical standards, addressing the growing demands to proactively mitigate and manage conflict of interest risk, and engaging with personnel at the onboarding stage to increase awareness of the ethical behaviour expected of all UN-Women personnel. As an independent office, the Ethics Advisor confirmed that the ethics function conducts its activities free from external interference and reports directly to the Under-Secretary- General/Executive Director. She stressed, however, that adequate resources must be devoted to ensure timely service delivery, as the ethics function continues to operate without sufficient long-term resources to enable the sustainable implementation of its mandates. 19. During the management response, the Chief of Staff of UN-Women reaffirmed the Entity\u2019s commitment to ethical governance and accountability, emphasizing that ethics is not a peripheral concern, but the foundation of trust and integrity within the organization. He highlighted the 85 per cent increase in service requests as a positive indicator of growing trust in the ethics function. The Chief of Staff expressed deep appreciation to the ethics team for their steadfast contributions, and acknowledged the critical updates to the Protection against Retaliation Policy as tangible safeguards that reinforce a culture of safety and openness.",

He added that UN-Women welcomed the expanded learning and outreach effort in collaboration with UNDP, underscoring the importance of system-wide coherence and shared principles. On UN-Women\u2019s full compliance with the Financial Disclosure Programme, the Chief of Staff noted it as essential to maintaining public trust and managing conflicts of interest. He also stressed that UN-Women underscores the importance of enabling staff to raise concerns and praised the ethics function for its guidance. He further reiterated that UN-Women remains firmly committed to ensuring that the ethics function is fully independent and adequately resourced. Noting the current financial constraints, the Chief of Staff shared that, in line with the UN80 principles of streamlining and coherence, UN-Women is exploring establishing a shared service model for the ethics function with other agencies to enhance efficiency and coherence. He concluded by thanking the Ethics Advisor for her outstanding service. 20. After opening the floor, one delegation requested to know more about the shared ethics service that was proposed by the Entity and what the timeline for its creation will be. The delegation also wanted to know whether any current gaps that exist in the ethics model will be bridged with the creation of the potential new joint model. A separate delegation thanked the ethics function for their diligent work in helping to foster cultural change and encouraged the Entity to increase participation in mandatory ethics trainings, and to finalize key polices under review, such as the policy on gifts and hospitality. 21. Responding to Member States\u2019 interventions, the Ethics Advisor confirmed that the function is finalizing some of the key policies, including the policy on gifts and UNW/2025/6 9/22 25-12751 hospitality. She shared that an online system is being developed for personnel to streamline requests for how to dispose of gifts. In addition, she shared that there was an increase in the completion of mandatory ethics trainings in 2024, and that training certification is required before personnel can request outside activities review and approval. The Chief of Staff also responded to Member States comments by stating that the Executive Board will receive an update on the shared ethics function at the second regular session of 2025, and assured that there will be no gaps between the current function and the planned shared function. VI. Review of governance and oversight of the Executive Boards of the United Nations Development Programme/United Nations Population Fund/ United Nations Office for Project Services, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund and UN-Women 22. A representative speaking on behalf of the Joint Inspection Unit (JIU) working group provided the Executive Board with an update on the progress of the group in implementing recommendations of the JIU in accordance with decisions 2024/3 and 2025/2. The speaker presented the working methods and road map of the group, developed in the Terms of Reference approved earlier in the year. The speaker added that the JIU working group will form thematic subgroups to effectively cluster recommendations. The speaker shared that there was agreement in the group to take a case-by-case approach, ensuring that decision-making is better aligned and meaningful. 23. One delegation speaking on behalf of 33 Member States welcomed the update by the JIU working group and noted that a key objective of the review must be to streamline Executive Board proceedings to facilitate more strategic deliberations and timely decision-making. The group also noted that this process should be supported by relevant actors within the organizations, units responsible for governance and oversight, or the secretariats. The group added that a mapping exercise would be useful to establish harmonized Terms of Reference of the Board secretariats. They concluded by stating that the process should take into account parallel reform efforts such as UN80. 24. The representative of the JIU working group responded to Member States\u2019 interventions by reaffirming the group\u2019s commitment to transparent and results- driven processes.",

Strategic Plan 25. The Under-Secretary-General/Executive Director presented the Executive Board with UN-Women's Draft Strategic Plan 2026\u20132029. She began her remarks by recalling the progress made on gender equality since the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. She highlighted the fragile nature of progress and added that not a single gender equality target has been met. She stated that the draft strategic plan takes these contexts into consideration, as well as the ongoing reform processes such as UN80 and UN 2.0. She shared that the new Strategic Plan is grounded in the Entity\u2019s triple mandate, as well as rights and norms. The next Strategic Plan identifies four areas of focus: (1) women's leadership and decision-making; (2) women's economic empowerment; (3) ending violence against women and girls; and (4) women, peace and security, and humanitarian action. There are three strategic UNW/2025/6 25-12751 10/22 outcomes of the plan: (1) protecting and advancing normative frameworks, laws and policies that uphold the rights of all women and girls; (2) strengthening institutions to be accountable through better financing, more robust data and practices that advance gender equality; and (3) expanding women's agency and ensuring women and girls have access to services, resources and opportunities to lead, decide and thrive. The Head of the Entity stated that UN-Women will strengthen and embed its coordination role as a cross-cutting priority across all areas of work. She added that UN-Women will extend its partnerships, expand alliances and broaden its donor base, and that it will also be strengthening its organizational efficiency and effectiveness by completing its pivot process and aligning staffing. She concluded by saying that by becoming nimbler and more focused, UN-Women will remain committed to its mandate and focus on the women and girls the Entity serves. 26. One delegation speaking on behalf of 29 Member States thanked UN-Women for its work in developing the Draft Strategic Plan 2026\u20132029 and the consultations the Entity held when developing it. The group urged UN-Women to take a leadership role in the UN80 process and leverage its coordination mandate in this regard. The group also requested to see greater efforts to clarify and highlight what sets UN-Women apart as a catalyst for inclusive and collaborative action across the United Nations. The group also appreciated the integration of the Quadrennial Comprehensive Policy Review into the next Strategic Plan and encouraged greater collaboration with the Resident Coordinator System. Another delegation speaking on behalf of a regional group urged UN-Women to use its coordination role to keep gender equality a priority during ongoing efforts to reform the United Nations system. In addition, the group urged UN-Women to align its Strategic Plan with funding realities and design it with flexibility to adjust for funding changes. The group encouraged UN-Women to maintain a strong and sustained focus on human rights, non-discrimination, reaching marginalized groups and fully implementing the United Nations Gender Equality Acceleration Plan. Another speaker on behalf of a regional group encouraged UN- Women to articulate more clearly how the current reform processes will be reflected in the implementation of the Strategic Plan. The group asked how UN-Women will refine its global footprint in the next Strategic Plan and encouraged the articulation of trade-offs required to ensure efficient use of resources. A further delegation in a national capacity commended UN-Women's cross-United Nations system feminist funding models that support women's rights organizations, as well as the advancement of the Women, Peace and Security agenda in the plan. Lastly, a Member State speaking in a national capacity emphasized that any UN-Women activity must be carried out with the agreement of States and urged UN-Women to use consensus- based language. 27.",

Lastly, a Member State speaking in a national capacity emphasized that any UN-Women activity must be carried out with the agreement of States and urged UN-Women to use consensus- based language. 27. Responding to Member States\u2019 interventions, the Deputy Executive Director for Normative Support, United Nations System Coordination and Programme Results reaffirmed the rights-based approach in the Strategic Plan 2026\u20132029 and highlighted the comparative advantage of UN-Women. She noted the emphasis on UN-Women's coordination role as the United Nations system undergoes reforms. The Deputy Executive Director for Resource Management, Sustainability and Partnerships affirmed that the Entity is cognizant of the funding realities, and has developed the draft strategic plan with adequate flexibility to accommodate changing resource levels. The Director of SPRED also responded to interventions from Member States noting that the Entity continues to refine its global footprint through a strategic, agile and cost-effective approach, guided by its presence governance framework and informed by regular strategic reviews and annual regional consultations. This dynamic model ensures alignment with evolving demands while maintaining affordability and responsiveness. She shared that gender mainstreaming remains a priority, with system-wide and entity-specific accountability mechanisms such as the UNW/2025/6 11/22 25-12751 United Nations System-wide Action Plan 3.0, gender markers and joint programming metrics being actively employed. She emphasized that UN-Women is enhancing its internal and external coordination indicators and capacity. She concluded by stating that the Entity remains committed to context-specific approaches, ensuring alignment with national development priorities and United Nations cooperation frameworks, thereby reinforcing its role as a responsive and accountable development partner. 28. The Director of the Policy, Programme and Intergovernmental Division outlined the strategic recalibration embedded in the new Strategic Plan, which reflects significant shifts in the global operating context and emphasizes a sharper programmatic focus, results orientation and institutional agility. The Director noted that the Strategic Plan consolidates efforts around three systemic outcomes and reduces the number of indicators from 120 to 75, thereby enhancing clarity and measurability of impact. This refinement is informed by lessons drawn from independent evaluations and audits, ensuring that global programming frameworks are aligned with the delivery of the Strategic Plan and focused within four impact areas, with cross-cutting priorities such as data and statistics. Furthermore, in addressing systemic challenges to mainstreaming gender equality across the United Nations system, UN-Women identified key barriers including limited institutional incentives, weak gender unit positioning, constrained joint programming resources and sustainability of coordination funding. She concluded by stating that with mechanisms such as the Gender Equality Acceleration Plan, the United Nations System-wide Action Plan and innovative resource tracking models such as those used by the Peacebuilding Fund, UN-Women continues to drive accountability and coherence in advancing gender equality across the United Nations system. VIII. Financial, budgetary and administrative matters 29. The Deputy Executive Director for Resource Management, Sustainability and Partnerships presented the draft integrated budget estimates for the biennium 2026\u2013 2027. She shared that the draft budget is developed in alignment with UN-Women\u2019s forthcoming Strategic Plan 2026\u20132029 and ongoing business transformation, and outlines a total projected voluntary contribution of $1.05 billion, representing a 2 per cent increase from the 2024\u20132025 biennium. She noted that this net growth of $20 million stems from a $70 million rise in other resources (from $630 million to $700 million), offset by a $50 million reduction in regular resources (from $400 million to $350 million). The institutional budget is set at $202.4 million, reflecting a $2 million cost reduction, and is underpinned by realistic income projections and a commitment to financial prudence. The budget prioritizes 87.3 per cent of total resources for development and humanitarian activities, encompassing coordination, normative and operational work at the regional and country levels.",

The budget prioritizes 87.3 per cent of total resources for development and humanitarian activities, encompassing coordination, normative and operational work at the regional and country levels. The budget is further informed by the Pivoting to Regions and Countries initiative, which aims to enhance support to field offices and improve cost-efficiency by relocating select global functions to lower-cost duty stations such as Bonn and Nairobi. She added that UN-Women is proposing to optimize its Headquarters structure in a cost-neutral manner aimed at strengthening and streamlining key functions to support the delivery of the Strategic Plan. 30. The Director of SPRED reported that UN-Women\u2019s draft integrated budget for the biennium 2026\u20132027 reflects a disciplined and impact-driven approach to resource allocation, with a total estimated voluntary contribution of $1.05 billion, comprising $350 million in regular resources and $700 million in other resources, despite a challenging financial landscape. She stressed that the proposal prioritizes programmatic delivery, with 87.3 per cent of total resources directed towards development results, while institutional expenditures are reduced by $2 million to UNW/2025/6 25-12751 12/22 $202.4 million, supported by an additional $4.6 million in cost recovery income in line with harmonized United Nations cost recovery policies. The Director added that the draft budget already reflects the organization\u2019s ongoing Pivoting to Regions and Countries initiative, relocating 50 institutional budget-funded posts at the Headquarters to Bonn and Nairobi to enhance cost-efficiency and proximity to beneficiaries. She concluded by stating that ongoing optimization efforts include the establishment of a dedicated Division of Communications and Advocacy, integration of financial resource management functions, and consolidation of results and performance oversight mechanisms. 31. One Member State speaking in their national capacity thanked UN-Women for its transparent and comprehensive briefing on the integrated budget estimates for 2026\u20132027. With regards to the Pivoting to Regions and Countries initiative, the delegation urged greater dialogue with Member States and asked to be given more information on progress. Another Member State requested more information on the rationale behind the proposed organizational changes to the budget unit and how UN- Women will ensure that resources continue to be linked to results. The delegation also requested to know which areas of UN-Women will achieve efficiency gains, and requested an update on the implementation of the cost recovery policy and on challenges that persist in fully implementing it. 32. Responding to the interventions of Member States, the Deputy Executive Director for Resource Management, Sustainability and Partnerships clarified that SPRED was established to reinforce the critical link between resources and results, with the budget function integrated into SPRED to support this mandate. Reflecting on her 18-month tenure and building on recommendations from a prior external financial review, she emphasized the need for a more integrated approach to financial resource management. To address this, UN-Women has initiated a process, with the support of external experts, to establish a more holistic financial management framework. This includes the proposed creation of a new Division of Financial Administration, which will work in close coordination with SPRED and other units to maintain strong results linkages while enhancing focus on budgeting and financial reporting. Additionally, the role of Director of the Division of Management and Administration will be restructured into a Chief Financial Officer position, deemed essential for an organization of UN-Women\u2019s scale. The Deputy Executive Director for Normative Support, United Nations System Coordination and Programme Results responded to interventions by Member States by reflecting that in the context of developing its Strategic Plan amid constrained resources, UN-Women has reaffirmed its commitment to delivering impactful results for women and girls by aligning resources with strategic priorities. The Entity is prioritizing investments in its normative and coordination mandates areas often supported through assessed rather than non-core contributions.",

The Entity is prioritizing investments in its normative and coordination mandates areas often supported through assessed rather than non-core contributions. UN-Women is centring its efforts on inclusive, participatory approaches that empower local actors to sustain progress in partnership with Member States. She concluded by noting that through the Integrated Results and Resources Framework, the Entity is striving to balance effectiveness with efficiency. 33. The Director of SPRED added that the observed budgetary efficiencies primarily stem from reductions in allocations previously categorized under special purpose costs, facilitated by the implementation of the ERP system and information and communications technology investments. She noted that strategic planning processes at the country level are conducted collaboratively across budgeting, planning and risk management functions, reinforcing coherence despite structural shifts. She highlighted that the Transparency Portal and enhanced results management systems are enabling more seamless linkages between resources and results across all organizational levels. On cost recovery, the Entity reaffirmed its full commitment to UNW/2025/6 13/22 25-12751 policy adherence, supported by updated guidance, regional consultations and capacity-building efforts. IX. Addressing racism and racial discrimination 34. The Deputy Executive Director presented an update on UN-Women\u2019s efforts to address racism and racial discrimination pursuant to decision 2024/6. She reaffirmed UN-Women\u2019s commitment to strengthen its organizational culture, improve the practice of its core values, and become a more diverse and inclusive workplace in alignment with the Secretary-General\u2019s Strategic Action Plan on Addressing Racism and Promoting Dignity for All. She shared examples of progress made so far, including the completion of key JIU recommendations and the implementation of initiatives promoting equity and inclusion, as well as offering unconscious bias training. She noted that UN-Women\u2019s current Strategic Plan intentionally centres its personnel, focusing on creating a positive workplace culture that respects inclusivity and diversity. She added that racial justice is fully integrated across all four impact areas and highlighted UN-Women\u2019s key efforts to address racism in programming and policy. 35. One delegation, speaking on behalf of 29 Member States, thanked UN-Women for its updates on efforts to prevent and address racism and racial discrimination in line with the recommendations of the JIU. The group condemned racism and underlined that UN-Women plays an important role in ensuring an intersectional approach by applying a gender lens to work on racial justice and addressing racial discrimination as part of its work towards achieving gender equality. They commended UN-Women for making progress, but encouraged more transparency around the challenges in addressing racial discrimination and noted that reporting on complaints of racial discrimination received by the IEAIS, if any, should be discussed under this agenda item. The delegation also requested to know what is being done to ensure that racism and racial discrimination is prevented and addressed within implementing partner organizations at the country level. 36. The Deputy Executive Director responded to interventions of Member States and expressed appreciation for their continued encouragement, and reaffirmed UN- Women's commitment to addressing racism within the Entity. It was noted that while overt racism has diminished over the decades, the more complex challenge lies in addressing unconscious bias and subtle perceptions that are difficult to document but deeply felt. To address this, she shared that UN-Women is investing in human resources strategies that foster inclusive workplace relations. She further emphasized the importance of shifting language and perceptions, particularly in recognizing the equal value of colleagues working in regional and country offices. The Deputy Executive Director also acknowledged the difficulty in reporting racial injustice, due to concerns around protection and retaliation. She concluded by stating that leadership remains committed to addressing racism, not only through policy but by transforming attitudes and interpersonal dynamics within the institution.",

She concluded by stating that leadership remains committed to addressing racism, not only through policy but by transforming attitudes and interpersonal dynamics within the institution. With regards to inquiries regarding allegations of racism, the Director of Human Resources acknowledged the importance of transparency and committed to engaging with IEAIS to determine how such matters can be appropriately reflected in future briefings, while respecting confidentiality protocols. He updated the Executive Board on the rollout of ClearCheck 2.0, noting that a United Nations-wide database is now expanded to include categories on anti-racism and racial discrimination, with reporting on the implementation expected from 2026 onwards. He further highlighted progress on the JIU recommendations, with three of six recommendations already implemented by UN-Women and inter-agency collaboration under way to address the UNW/2025/6 25-12751 14/22 remaining items, while recognizing the need for shared resources, capacity and alignment through mechanisms such as the High-Level Committee on Management. 37. The Director of the Policy, Programme and Intergovernmental Division reaffirmed that UN-Women\u2019s work is fully aligned with international norms and standards and that principles of human rights, inclusion and non-discrimination are incorporated comprehensively in its triple mandate. She shared that, at the country level, the Entity prioritizes the selection and capacity-building of implementing partners aligned with a localization agenda and committed to addressing all forms of discrimination. She continued to say that UN-Women\u2019s approach complements broader United Nations efforts by emphasizing the gender dimensions of racial injustice. Additionally, UN-Women leverages its expertise in gender data and statistics to promote intersectional analysis and collaborates with civil society, academia and United Nations entities to advance inclusive research and evidence- based advocacy. X. UN-Women\u2019s operational response at the regional level 38. In her presentation, the Regional Director for Europe and Central Asia noted that, despite many countries in the region experiencing complex legacies of political and economic transitions, countries have continued to advance commitments to gender equality. She shared that between 2000 and 2024, the share of seats held by women in national parliaments more than tripled. She added that, despite this progress, no country in the region is fully on track to achieve gender equality by 2030. The Regional Director highlighted challenges facing women in the region, including the disproportionate undertaking of unpaid care work, the gender pay gap and high levels of violence against women, particularly technology-facilitated violence. In addition, she emphasized that the persistence and escalation of armed conflict in the region continue to have a profound impact on gender equality. She further expressed concern regarding the growing backlash against gender equality and erosion of the civic space in the region. She noted that at the normative level, UN-Women has been leading and supporting normative work on key international frameworks, including the regional Beijing+30 review meeting in which 95 per cent of countries produced national reports on Beijing+30. She highlighted that UN-Women\u2019s operational response has focused on supporting gender-responsive governance through strengthening women\u2019s leadership and political participation, engaging with other United Nations agencies to invest in gender data systems and promoting gender- responsive budgeting. The Regional Director further highlighted key results achieved by UN-Women on women, peace and security, and shared examples of humanitarian response in the region. On ending violence against women, she highlighted that UN- Women has supported integrated programming contributing to more survivor-centred and accountable systems and that a UN-Women advocacy campaign to address and transform gender stereotypes reached more than 27 million people and affected legislative reform in six countries. The Regional Director noted that UN-Women has leveraged its triple mandate to strengthen partnerships with sister agencies and United Nations country teams in the region, and thanked funding partners for their increased contributions to non-core resources, allowing country offices to implement flexible, demand-driven interventions.",

She added that the regional office is exploring diversifying funding sources and building partnerships with the private sector and international financial institutions. In conclusion, the Regional Director expressed that the regional office is developing a forward-looking regional strategic note that takes UN80 reforms into account and seeks to optimize efficiencies. 39. After opening the floor, one Member State acknowledged the progress achieved by UN-Women in the region, particularly in promoting women\u2019s participation and UNW/2025/6 15/22 25-12751 leadership in government, monitoring instances of violence against women in politics, and assisting national governments with gender mainstreaming in policymaking and budgeting. Another Member State asked how UN-Women plans to deliver on its triple mandate in the region given tightening financial constraints. Finally, a third Member State thanked UN-Women for its work to improve the situation of women and children in the region but called on UN-Women to adhere to the principle of neutrality when discussing the conflict in Ukraine. 40. In response, the Deputy Executive Director thanked Member States for their comments, taking note of both the complexities of funding constraints and UN- Women\u2019s adherence to the principle of neutrality. On the question from a delegation regarding delivering UN-Women\u2019s triple mandate amid funding constraints, the Regional Director emphasized that the regional office is working alongside sister agencies to deploy joint initiatives tackling gender equality challenges. She also emphasized that the office\u2019s upcoming strategic note aims to strengthen UN-Women\u2019s operational response in the region and anchor it in UN-Women\u2019s coordination and normative mandate. The Deputy Director of the Policy, Programme and Intergovernmental Division emphasized the importance of strengthening UN- Women\u2019s coordination mandate in order to ensure the success of joint programming. XI. Implementation of General Assembly resolution 72/279 on the repositioning of the United Nations development system 41. The Deputy Executive Director presented an update on the implementation of the General Assembly resolution 72/279 on the repositioning of the United Nations Development System. She first expressed her appreciation to Member States for adopting Economic and Social Council resolution E/2025/L.14 on mainstreaming a gender perspective into all policies and programmes in the United Nations system and underscored UN-Women\u2019s commitment to supporting a reinvigorated Resident Coordinator System. The Deputy Executive Director emphasized that the Entity provides crucial advisory and technical guidance to the United Nations country teams in their prioritization of gender equality and empowerment of women in line with UN-Women\u2019s mandate to lead, coordinate and promote gender equality accountability within the United Nations system. She shared several examples of how UN-Women supports United Nations system coordination mechanisms for prioritizing gender equality in ensuring United Nations actions are grounded in diverse country contexts, including by highlighting UN-Women\u2019s engagement in joint programmes, Funding Compacts and UN-Women led funds such as the Trust Fund to End Violence Against Women. She shared that UN-Women supported 116 country teams in 2024 \u2013 a 20 per cent increase from the previous year \u2013 and 75 United Nations entities in their implementation of United Nations country team- and United Nations sector-wide approaches on gender equality. The Deputy Executive Director reiterated UN- Women\u2019s commitment to repositioning the United Nations system and stated that 90 per cent of UN-Women country offices participate in the use of shared global services. In conclusion, she stressed UN-Women\u2019s role as a leader in mainstreaming gender equality in UN80 reforms and expressed UN-Women\u2019s support for the revitalization of the Commission on the Status of Women and the implementation of the Pact for the Future. 42.

In conclusion, she stressed UN-Women\u2019s role as a leader in mainstreaming gender equality in UN80 reforms and expressed UN-Women\u2019s support for the revitalization of the Commission on the Status of Women and the implementation of the Pact for the Future. 42. After opening the floor, a delegation speaking on behalf of 30 Member States welcomed the Secretary-General\u2019s UN80 initiative and stressed that UN80 builds on reforms already under way. The group emphasized that they see great potential in the further consolidation and increased use of shared services, common back offices and common premises. It then asked the Secretariat what actions UN-Women is taking to consolidate joint business operations within the United Nations system and requested UNW/2025/6 25-12751 16/22 that UN-Women keep Member States informed of current cost reduction measures. The group noted with concern that implementation of the Management and Accountability Framework has stalled and asked how UN-Women will ensure improved implementation of this framework. The group also asked UN-Women to elaborate on challenges faced in sufficiently implementing the dual reporting model. The group further noted that Resident Coordinators estimate that 79 per cent of entity- specific programming instruments are aligned with the cooperation framework, but argued that this alignment does not translate into genuine derivation from the cooperation frameworks into agency-specific plans. Finally, the group called on UN- Women to connect ongoing business model reviews and reorganization exercises to the goal of needs-based country presence. 43. Responding to Member States\u2019 comments, the Deputy Executive Director for Normative Support, United Nations System Coordination and Programme Results expressed appreciation for Member States\u2019 guidance on United Nations reforms. She noted that UN-Women brings gender equality issues to the foreground of discussions in the United Nations system Development Cluster within UN80. She also emphasized UN-Women\u2019s involvement in the United Nations system coordination evaluation review, recognizing Member States\u2019 commentary on proper alignment. The Deputy Executive Director further noted that UN-Women works within the United Nations system to define gender outcomes at the cooperation level, including through joint programmes. The Deputy Executive Director for Resource Management, Sustainability and Partnerships emphasized that UN-Women\u2019s business model requires external services to ensure efficiency. She noted UN-Women\u2019s commitment to the use of common premises, but emphasized that there were not significant savings in country offices with common back offices. She further underlined the importance of global shared services in optimizing efficiency and pooling resources across the United Nations system. In response to the question from Member States regarding the Management Accountability Framework, the Deputy Director of the United Nations system Coordination Division noted UN-Women\u2019s engagement in the Management and Accountability Framework update and review process, especially in gender and human rights contexts. The Deputy Director also noted that despite UN-Women\u2019s nearly 90 per cent compliance with the dual reporting model, there is still room for improvement. She emphasized the mutually reinforcing relationship between UN- Women and Resident Coordinators in advancing the gender equality agenda. The Director of SPRED noted that UN-Women has a mandatory step of soliciting inputs throughout the strategic note development process from the Resident Coordinator, as well as a sign-off and approval of the Resident Coordinator. The SPRED Director concluded her response by emphasizing that the Secretariat works closely with regional directors in collaboration with relevant divisions and at UN-Women Headquarters to maximize results where country-based needs are the greatest. XII. Update on policies and procedures to tackle sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment 44. The Under-Secretary-General/Executive Director delivered an update on UN- Women policies and procedures to tackle sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment. She reaffirmed UN-Women\u2019s commitment to preventing and responding to sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA) and sexual harassment (SH), emphasizing its importance as both a moral duty and a matter of trust. The Head of UN-Women noted progress in the following areas: strengthened and more accessible survivor-centred reporting mechanisms, with over 90 per cent of staff knowing how to report SEA/SH, risk assessments integrating SEA/SH considerations in 98 per cent of risk-owning units, a",

The Head of UN-Women noted progress in the following areas: strengthened and more accessible survivor-centred reporting mechanisms, with over 90 per cent of staff knowing how to report SEA/SH, risk assessments integrating SEA/SH considerations in 98 per cent of risk-owning units, and the deployment of SEA/SH focal points and a new outreach guide for local UNW/2025/6 17/22 25-12751 civil society. She emphasized that UN-Women is leading knowledge-sharing across the United Nations system as part of the United Nations Executive Group. The Head of the Entity also noted UN-Women's work on SEA/SH outside the United Nations system, noting initiatives such as Safe Cities and advocacy for gender-responsive policies in collaboration with the World Health Organization, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the International Labour Organization. She concluded by reaffirming UN-Women's dedication to ensuring safety, dignity and justice for survivors. 45. After opening the floor, one delegation speaking on behalf of 40 Member States and donors commended UN-Women's survivor-centred approach to preventing and responding to SEA/SH. The group welcomed efforts to promote an inclusive, diverse and safe organizational culture to address root causes of SEA/SH and urged UN- Women to ensure sufficient resources for SEA/SH prevention and response, particularly at the country level, amid financial constraints. The group highlighted the need for inter-agency collaboration and resource pooling, especially in risk analysis, community engagement and partner capacity-building. The Member States also called on UN-Women to leverage its expertise in combating gender-based violence to support mapping and expanding of gender-based violence services. The group encouraged the use of the Misconduct Disclosure Scheme and the United Nations Secretary-General\u2019s 2025 special measures report, asking UN-Women whether it plans to expand the Scheme beyond its 2025 pilot. In closing, the group requested insights from the 2024 Protection from SEA perception survey, particularly key outcomes and areas identified for improvement. 46. Responding to Member States\u2019 comments, the Deputy Executive Director for Resource Management, Sustainability and Partnerships noted that UN-Women hosts the United Nations system-wide Knowledge Hub on addressing SH, which was recently enhanced with accessibility features and translations into all six official United Nations languages. She shared that a comprehensive report is being developed under the United Nations Executive Group to assess current policies, tools and practices surrounding SEA/SH prevention and response. The Deputy Executive Director noted several key findings of the report, including widespread but inconsistent application of tools across agencies, challenges in policy coverage for non-staff and concerns regarding fear of retaliation in reporting. She emphasized that an emerging recommendation is to integrate prevention mechanisms under a unified survivor-centred framework. In addition to her colleague\u2019s response, the Deputy Executive Director for Normative Support, United Nations System Coordination and Programme Results underscored the importance of UN-Women collaboration with Member States in ensuring survivors of SEA/SH have access to effective legal recourse at the country level. In addressing Member States\u2019 comments urging UN- Women to maintain proper funding for addressing SEA/SH, the Director of Human Resources reaffirmed his commitment to sustainably resourcing SEA/SH prevention and response. The Director shared that UN-Women is piloting the Misconduct Disclosure Scheme in 2025 and will consider a broader roll-out following the pilot phase if sufficient resources are available. The Director also shared results of the Protection from SEA perception survey, which indicated that 96 per cent of UN- Women respondents could distinguish SEA from SH and were aware of relevant policies and reporting mechanisms. The Director concluded his response by reaffirming UN-Women's commitment to awareness-building efforts and strengthening reporting mechanisms based on survey findings. UNW/2025/6 25-12751 18/22 XIII.

Mention of such a symbol indicates a reference to a United Nations document. ISSN 0257-0661 25-04788 3/28 Summary The present report contains the main findings and recommendations of the Committee for Development Policy at its twenty-seventh session. As its contribution to the theme of the 2025 session of the Economic and Social Council, the Committee addressed new contexts and pathways for development. Several structural shifts have changed the foundational assumptions on which development policy is based. These shifts include the breaching of multiple planetary boundaries; geopolitical and geoeconomic shifts; increasing inequalities, including of access to the global commons and natural capital; significant technological changes, particularly artificial intelligence; a weakening role of the State; and a decline in commitments to norms and values underpinning the international order. Generally, convergence in economic, human and social development has not been the norm and advances remain fragile in the face of what are expected to be increasingly frequent and severe climate-related and other shocks. However, many developing countries have seen significant improvements regarding poverty and important aspects of health and education. These achievements need to be made more visible to inspire action. Metrics matter, and an excessive focus on relative poverty reduction obscures the very tangible achievements made by many countries in the reduction of poverty in all of its forms and dimensions over the past decades, particularly on the African continent. The potential of trade as an engine for sustainable development and structural transformation has not fully materialized, with least developed countries still far from the Sustainable Development Goal 17 target of doubling their share in global exports. The capacity of many developing countries to advance towards the Goals has been limited by large debt burdens, an unreasonably high cost of borrowing, and limited capacity to mobilize domestic resources. Moreover, many developing countries are not well equipped in terms of capacities in science, technology and innovation to take advantage of the opportunities presented by technological advances for development. Against this backdrop, the Committee emphasized the need for a strong and effective multilateralism that acknowledges and responds to the asymmetries in needs and capabilities, supports domestic policy action and guarantees policy and fiscal space. Effective multilateralism also requires pragmatic agreements and innovative approaches that advance the reduction of poverty, respond to interrelated and mutually reinforcing deprivations in an integrated manner, and leave no one behind. Eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions remains the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement of sustainable development. The Fourth International Conference on Financing for Development and the Second World Summit for Social Development provide unique windows of opportunity for a strong, pragmatic and innovative multilateral response. The Committee initiated its review of the framework for graduation from the least developed country category, building on its experience and lessons learned on least developed country issues over the past five decades. The need to support least developed countries in transforming their economies towards sustainable development by better integrating themselves into the global economy remains as pressing at present as it was in the past. Despite remarkable progress by several least developed countries towards graduation primarily over the past two decades, the difficulties of many to advance their development and the challenges that they face because of the structural shifts outlined above require a renewed consideration and continuous emphasis by the international community. This endeavour needs to include a focus on support for countries that have so far been unable to benefit substantially from existing international support measures. In parallel to this work on the overall effectiveness of support to least developed countries, there is also a need to update 4/28 25-04788 the procedures for graduation to reduce uncertainty and increase the transparency of current and upcoming graduation processes. The Committee developed a series of proposals so that the procedures can address the various disruptions that graduation processes may entail.",

In parallel to this work on the overall effectiveness of support to least developed countries, there is also a need to update 4/28 25-04788 the procedures for graduation to reduce uncertainty and increase the transparency of current and upcoming graduation processes. The Committee developed a series of proposals so that the procedures can address the various disruptions that graduation processes may entail. While some of the proposals can be implemented by the Committee within its existing mandates, several others could be considered within a process to update the existing resolutions on smooth transition from the least developed country category. In its enhanced monitoring of countries that are graduating or have graduated from the category, the Committee reviewed the development progress of two recently graduated countries and six graduating countries. Expressing concern over the limited national capacity of these countries to address various challenges, including those stemming from multiple global crises, less affordable finance, geopolitical tensions, and climate change, the Committee underscored the importance of addressing these issues with continued support from trading and development partners, including United Nations entities. The Committee welcomed the positive feedback and increased and active participation of countries in the enhanced monitoring mechanism and encouraged continued progress in reporting on the preparation and implementation of smooth transition strategies. It reviewed the structure and operation of the mechanism and proposes further improvements and clarifications to better address the needs of graduating and graduated countries. 25-04788 5/28 [24 March 2025] Contents Chapter Page I.

As the United Nations approaches its eightieth anniversary, it finds itself at a crossroads that requires an unequivocal reaffirmation of the need for a strong multilateral system; of the values espoused in the Charter of the United Nations; and of the pledge to leave no one behind. Trust in the multilateral system relies on its effectiveness. Too many commitments remain unmet, and many aspects of the system remain structurally inadequate in a world that continues to be widely asymmetric, in which convergence in economic, human and social development has not proved to be the norm, and that currently faces fundamental structural shifts. These include a breaching of multiple planetary boundaries; geopolitical and geoeconomic shifts; increasing inequalities, including of access to the global commons and natural capital; technological change, particularly artificial intelligence; a weakening role of the State; and a decline in commitments to norms and values underpinning the international order. 2. Responding to those realities and ensuring a voice and representation for all countries is a matter of effectiveness of the system as much as of fairness. The multilateral system must support the capacity, policy space and fiscal space of States to address the long-standing goals of poverty eradication, equality, and structural transformation of their economies, as well as to face new challenges such as those related to the ecological crisis and major technological changes.",

The multilateral system must support the capacity, policy space and fiscal space of States to address the long-standing goals of poverty eradication, equality, and structural transformation of their economies, as well as to face new challenges such as those related to the ecological crisis and major technological changes. The global trading system needs to be informed by pro-development principles. The global and regional institutional structures and norms for financing for development need to deliver results for developing countries in securing debt sustainability and reducing the debt burden which weighs heavily on the public budgets; reducing the excessively high cost of borrowing; enabling tax cooperation, which is a crucial element in the capacity of countries to mobilize domestic resources; and maximizing the potential of multilateral development banks to help countries to advance in structural transformation. There is significant scope for improvement in procedures and practices to ensure that the development efforts of international organizations and international financial institutions effectively and efficiently reach those \u2013 both countries and people \u2013 furthest behind. These improvements should be undertaken in the framework of efforts to strengthen, not weaken, multilateral structures and collaboration. Metrics matter: evidence-based, pragmatic recommendations to advance towards poverty eradication 3. Ahead of the Second World Summit for Social Development and as Member States reflect and deliberate on advancing sustainable development by 2030 and beyond, the eradication of poverty in all its forms and dimensions remains imperative. How poverty is defined and measured, how poverty eradication goals are framed, and how indicators are chosen have significant practical importance for the effectiveness of policy. In chapter II, the Committee makes four recommendations on the measurement of poverty and poverty reduction and their link to policy action. The Committee will further elaborate on these recommendations as part of its upcoming contributions to the Summit. E/2025/33 25-04788 7/28 Framework for graduation from the least developed country category 4. The Committee remains highly concerned about the difficult external environment that least developed countries face in their pursuit towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and their own national development goals, including progressing towards graduation from the list of least developed countries. The mounting impacts of climate change, armed conflicts, long-lasting negative effects from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, macroeconomic challenges, an increase in protectionism and looming massive reductions in official development assistance (ODA) cloud the prospects of least developed countries. This holds true in particular for those that remain far from meeting the established criteria for graduation and often face severe impediments for which there is currently no adequate international support. A thorough rethinking of international support to least developed countries is needed. 5. An effective framework for graduation requires not only specific support and incentives that reflect a changing global environment and persistent and emerging challenges but also procedures that can address possible disruptions to multi-year graduation processes. The Committee developed concrete proposals to refine the current procedures for ongoing and upcoming graduations, as outlined in chapter III of the present report. In this regard, the Committee reiterates the importance of updating the existing General Assembly resolutions on smooth transition as one of the means to make the graduation framework fit for purpose. It reiterates its availability to substantively contribute to the process culminating in a new resolution. Monitoring of countries that are graduating or have graduated from the list of least developed countries 6. The Committee monitored the development progress of eight countries that have recently graduated or are graduating from the list of least developed countries. It noted an overall advancement towards sustainable graduation amid common and unique challenges stemming from various global crises, geopolitical tensions, and climate change. These challenges, such as mounting debt, inflationary pressures and currency devaluation, have become significant hurdles for many of the monitored countries in maintaining macroeconomic stability. 7.",

These challenges, such as mounting debt, inflationary pressures and currency devaluation, have become significant hurdles for many of the monitored countries in maintaining macroeconomic stability. 7. In response, many countries require substantial support from their trading and development partners, including entities within the United Nations system, to facilitate their progress towards smooth and sustainable graduation. 8. The Committee will continue to improve the structure and operation of its enhanced monitoring mechanism, based on lessons learned from the mechanism\u2019s implementation. E/2025/33 8/28 25-04788 Chapter II New development contexts and pathways A. Fundamental shifts and megatrends redefining the global economy require a strengthened multilateralism for development 9. A number of structural shifts are converging to create a world that is very different from the one on which the current multilateral development system and contemporary development policy, in all its diversity, were founded. These shifts will shape the context in which policymakers will navigate development pathways in the coming years and decades. The world is at the edge of several planetary tipping points, with profound implications for human security and livelihoods as well as for the prospects of development. The poorest countries are the least equipped to protect themselves against the risks related to this ecological crisis as human lives, physical infrastructure and public budgets are left vulnerable and development gains are subject to reversals. Widening inequalities in incomes, wealth and social opportunities are, at present, also exacerbated by the unequal impacts of the ecological crisis and unequal access to the global commons and natural capital. Major technological changes with economy-wide impact, particularly the expansion of artificial intelligence and a significant (if still insufficient) transition towards clean energy, are changing the drivers of economic growth and productivity, and while they present opportunities, they also have the potential to generate severe disruptions, including in the labour market. Taking advantage of the opportunities will depend on the capacity of economies to shape and unleash these technologies, which many countries do not yet have. 10. These shifts, which are taking place against a backdrop of slow progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals, incomplete and fragile convergence in economic and social dimensions (see sect. D below), rising income inequalities, insufficient generation of decent jobs, and insufficient structural transformation in developing economies, demand strategic action by States in the context of an enabling and supportive multilateral framework. However, increasing political polarization worldwide, geopolitical and geoeconomic tensions and fragmentation, and a decline in commitments to the values of democracy, human rights, equality and solidarity that have underpinned the international world order since the formation of the United Nations, are having severe impacts on the functioning of the multilateral system and on the ability to garner genuine international consensus and collaboration on matters of global relevance and mutual interest. A gulf has developed between ambitions and reality and between commitments and implementation, contributing to a loss of trust. At the national level, the capacity of States, particularly developing countries, to invest and regulate in the public interest, has been weakened by severe limits to fiscal and policy space, and the channelling of resources to productive investment has been limited by a financial system geared above all towards short-term financial return. 11. The new contexts and the threats facing the current system call for an unequivocal reaffirmation of the importance of the multilateral system for development and of its urgent strengthening through greater effectiveness and alignment with contemporary realities and challenges. The measure against which the strength and effectiveness of the multilateral system will be assessed is the extent to which it delivers results for people and communities, especially those furthest behind. 12. A stronger multilateralism will be one that is rooted in a more inclusive and representative framework, takes a pragmatic approach to delivering results, advances genuine consensus on common goals, reflects asymmetries in needs and capabilities, and ensures policy",

A stronger multilateralism will be one that is rooted in a more inclusive and representative framework, takes a pragmatic approach to delivering results, advances genuine consensus on common goals, reflects asymmetries in needs and capabilities, and ensures policy space for countries to advance on country-specific strategies for E/2025/33 25-04788 9/28 structural transformation. Within the broader multilateral framework, regional, plurilateral, South-South and issues-based coalitions can provide opportunities to advance on processes, institutions and cooperation for sustainable and equitable global development. 13. Navigating new and rapidly changing contexts will require government capacity for strategic policymaking and engagement with the private sector and other actors with a view to integration into global value chains and to continued competitiveness in a rapidly shifting economic and technological environment. This includes exploring alternatives to traditional technological development policies, exploring co-development opportunities, investing in general-purpose technologies, and seeking out strategic advantages on which to build competitive assets. For example, for Africa, a young population in the context of an ageing world can also generate great potential in terms of markets and future technological development, particularly if intellectual property regimes enable the development of African innovation systems and a better distribution of the value associated with innovation. South-South experience-sharing can be an important instrument in building these capacities. The objective of securing decent employment remains critical but needs to be complemented with approaches that empower individuals and businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, to take advantage of opportunities in this new and fast-changing setting, including clean technologies, the circular economy, the nature economy and bioeconomy, and the oceans economy. B. Financing for development 14. The actions of the international community on financing for development and the international financial architecture, including the outcomes of the Fourth International Conference on Financing for Development, need to be taken with full consideration of their impacts for people, families and small businesses, including those in the periphery of the formal financial system. 15. The capacity of many developing countries to advance towards the Sustainable Development Goals has been limited by large debt burdens, an unreasonably high cost of borrowing, and limited capacity to mobilize domestic resources. As stated above, the institutional structures and norms for financing for development need to be able to deliver results in terms of securing debt sustainability and reducing the debt burden which weighs heavily on the public budgets; reducing the excessively high cost of borrowing, including by developing alternatives to the current credit rating system; enabling tax cooperation; and maximizing the potential of multilateral development banks to help countries to advance in structural transformation. The Committee has made recommendations for institutional reforms that would facilitate the alignment of the global financing architecture with the social goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development; a greater role for multilateral development banks in the provision and financing of international public goods, both global and regional; the creation of an International Monetary Fund-managed instrument for international liquidity provision for emerging markets and developing economies; a mechanism for restructuring sovereign debts to overcome problems of overindebtedness and to guarantee sustainable growth; the creation of a global asset registry to control tax evasion and avoidance; and the transformation of the Committee of Experts on International Cooperation in Tax Matters into an intergovernmental organ. Action areas to realize the potential of trade and innovation for development are also highlighted. 16. In the context of unprecedented reductions in foreign aid and great uncertainty, development cooperation needs to be reoriented to strengthen its focus on building E/2025/33 10/28 25-04788 capacity within developing countries to advance towards the Sustainable Development Goals, foster structural transformation and build resilience.",

This includes the capacity to mobilize domestic resources; undertake domestic reforms that facilitate and attract investment that fosters structural transformation; design and implement integrated and context-appropriate sustainable industrial policies, poverty eradication and social protection strategies, and disaster risk reduction strategies; and generate capabilities in innovation and general-purpose technologies. Better use can be made of the potential of South-South peer learning and experience-sharing, and the potential of artificial intelligence in the dissemination of policy experiences and lessons and in strategic decision-making for development should be explored. There should also be careful scrutiny of procedures and practices to eliminate inefficiencies, such as project transaction costs that dwarf the benefits of the assistance, exploring context- and scale-appropriate alternative accountability mechanisms. C. Trade as engine for sustainable development 17. The potential of trade as an engine for development is widely recognized, including in the 2030 Agenda and the Pact for the Future. Indeed, over the past decades trade has been an important factor in lifting millions out of poverty. However, the development gains of trade are neither guaranteed nor automatic, and many countries and groups of people have been left out or even pushed behind. Many countries have not been able to reach their potential in terms of diversification, structural transformation and inclusive growth through trade. In the promising sector of critical minerals, many developing countries, including least developed countries, that are endowed with critical minerals remain linked into global value chains predominantly as providers of raw materials. This means that the potential for trade to advance transformational activities and jobs is being transferred to other places. 18. The current landscape presents an increasingly complex and uncertain picture, with geopolitical and geoeconomic shifts generating significant headwinds, adding to existing challenges in logistics, maritime security and issues of global taxation, including climate-related taxation. It requires a renewed commitment to a trade ecosystem anchored in a rules-based, fair, transparent and supportive multilateral trading system that reflects asymmetries in global development and contemporary challenges and opportunities, and ensures space for context-appropriate national development pathways. 19. Some of the limitations of the current multilateral trading system are systemic, by design of the rules and of the architecture of governance, and others by incomplete implementation and enforcement. One critical design element has been insufficient differentiation to reflect and accommodate the widely disparate levels of development and trade capabilities. A level playing field among a group of countries that includes the poorest of the least developed countries and the world\u2019s largest trade players cannot be achieved with rules with predominantly marginal and ineffective differentiation. A multilateral system that delivers on the promise of trade as an engine for development needs to agree on disciplines to address the proliferation of subsidies and protectionist measures while allowing developing countries to use policy tools to achieve their development aspirations according to their capacities and needs, subject to specific global rules. Dispute settlement mechanisms need to be effective and accessible, taking into account the severe resource limitations, including diplomatic and public administration resources, of least developed countries and many developing countries, particularly smaller ones. 20. The global system functions alongside an ecosystem of regional, plurilateral and bilateral agreements that have developed over time. These agreements have the E/2025/33 25-04788 11/28 potential to encourage new trade patterns, particularly at a moment of rising South- South trade, and bring about new development gains and opportunities. Regional agreements have enabled and are enabling advances in regulatory cooperation and harmonization, investment policy, competition policy and other areas.",

Regional agreements have enabled and are enabling advances in regulatory cooperation and harmonization, investment policy, competition policy and other areas. The deeper the integration, the greater the degree of diversification, and the stronger the institutional framework for implementation, the more likely these agreements are to advance development in their signatory countries. Reform of the global trading system also needs to address agricultural trade rules related to market access challenges of developing countries, the impacts of climate change and global food insecurity. Intellectual property rules need to ensure access to technology for global public goods and to support innovation and the commercialization and protection of intellectual property generated in the developing world. 21. Even with pro-development multilateral institutions and rules, trade will not fulfil its potential as an engine for sustainable development without integrated domestic policies in tune with the fast-changing global environment. Successful industrial policies are often derived from a consultative process with multiple stakeholders and have linked support to measurable targets, included sunset clauses and continuous evaluations and generally emphasized horizontal over vertical support. Their integration with strategies for innovation and intellectual property creation is particularly important in the rapidly changing technological context marked by the rise of digitalization, artificial intelligence, the energy transition and advances towards a circular economy. Effective trade policy requires investment in robust infrastructure and logistics systems; an efficient bureaucracy; education policy (including technical and high school education) that is in line with industrial policy; a simple and transparent tariff and non-tariff regime; and a trade finance strategy that includes accessible finance for micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises and businesses owned by women, youth and marginalized communities. Where applicable, public development banks should expand trade finance facilities, and there should be a re-evaluation of risk ratings for trade finance in international banking regulatory systems, such as the Basel III framework. 22. Of special relevance to least developed countries is the issue of preferential trading arrangements. These arrangements were conceived to support developing countries in reducing reliance on commodity exports, creating well-paying manufacturing jobs and reducing poverty. Currently there are multiple preferential market access schemes, some of which have been integral to the advancement of some countries towards graduation from the least developed country category. However, many other countries have not been able to take advantage of these schemes. National capacity to produce tradable goods and services is often limited, as is the capacity to innovate and protect innovation, attract investment, and invest in infrastructure and logistics, all of which also depend on access to finance and integrated national policies. Moreover, over time, preferential margins have been eroded due to multiple trade agreements and the decline in most-favoured-nation tariffs, and non-tariff barriers have increased. Rules of origin often do not reflect contemporary production realities. Some bilateral preferential market access schemes have also proved unpredictable in their implementation, reducing their impact, given the uncertainties that they create for investors and policymakers. To be relevant, preferential market access schemes need to be revised, taking into account the changes that have occurred over the past decades, and need to be accompanied by significantly greater support to boost productive capacities in developing countries and, particularly, least developed countries.

In the 2030 Agenda, eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, was named as the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development. The Pact for the Future reiterated this objective as an imperative for all humankind. However, 10 years after the adoption of the 2030 Agenda, the world is off track. The priority and urgency of eradicating poverty will be one of the three core themes at the upcoming Second World Summit for Social Development and is central to other global processes such as the Fourth International Conference on Financing for Development, the thirtieth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty. Ensuring that no one is left behind or pushed behind, a concept that has found widespread resonance since 2015, is critical moving forward. The current global context calls for breaking-the-mould approaches and pragmatic solutions, for which research and evidence are critical, as recognized in the choice of theme of the Economic and Social Council for 2025. 24. Convergence in development outcomes between and within countries has been at the centre of analytical work on development. With new challenges and changing development contexts, a sophisticated understanding of convergence is needed, one that includes multidimensional poverty measures, lessons from the efforts that have been made to \u201cleave no one behind\u201d, and a comprehensive concept of human development. There is a need to address both new and persistent inequalities to ensure inclusive and multidimensional convergence. Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita can no longer be the benchmark for success in development. 25. Convergence between least developed countries and other developing countries has been a focus of the work of the Committee since the inception of the least developed country category. Analysis of the development of countries based on the criteria that officially define the category shows that least developed countries have made progress and even achieved some degree of convergence on social indicators, such as reducing child and maternal mortality and achieving gender parity in school completion. However, convergence overall has been limited, particularly in economic and environmental indicators. Beyond the official indicators, least developed countries showed faster improvements in some areas, such as electricity access and immunization rates, but lagged in others, such as Internet access, disaster resilience and refugee displacement. Over time, there have been notable shifts in global convergence trends. Periods of regression, such as in the 1970s and 1980s, were followed by periods of greater convergence, such as from 2005 to 2015, but in the more recent period progress has stagnated on several dimensions. Likewise, the human development index scores for least developed countries suffered a reversal after the pandemic. It is not yet clear whether the recent stagnation and reversals will be short-lived or are indicative of a longer-term challenge. However, recent trends demonstrate that any convergence is vulnerable to shocks of multiple natures, which are expected to become more frequent and more severe, requiring the incorporation of resilience-building and disaster risk reduction in convergence strategies. 26. One of the factors behind the insufficient convergence is the meagre progress on structural transformation. Many least developed countries have become more commodity dependent over time, with deep implications for inclusive growth, employment, and poverty eradication. A number of other factors have affected recent advances, including recurrent crises, a persistent digital divide, rising living costs, development finance constraints including the burden of external debt, and political instability. Conflict, insecurity and displacement have also significantly stunted convergence. The new context presents new challenges: for example, artificial E/2025/33 25-04788 13/28 intelligence can present significant challenges for countries and people who are not equipped to take advantage of its potential and instead are vulnerable to the labour and other disruptions that it creates. In a context of ecological crisis, while convergence and structural transformation remain goals, new pathways towards those goals need to be explored, for example through new technologies and new value chains, which in turn requires countries to invest in productive capacities, including innovation and technological capacities. 27.",

Social convergence within the poorest countries is closely linked to enabling upward intergenerational mobility. Key policies in this regard include policies rebalancing economic and financial inequalities between locations and between wealth groups, as well as those strengthening child health and education. This underscores the importance of harnessing the positive relationship between reducing poverty and accelerating social convergence. Reducing monetary poverty rebalances economic and financial inequalities, whereas reducing multidimensional poverty improves status in health, education and living standards. Integrated approaches that consider cross-sectoral co-benefits have often proved to be more effective than approaches focusing on single dimensions of deprivations individually. 28. Despite the insufficient progress and convergence by least developed countries overall, several developing countries, including some least developed countries, have made significant strides in narrowing development gaps and shown remarkable resilience in the face of adversity. It is important to recognize those facts, both to value the potential lessons of these experiences and to eliminate outdated narratives that can be damaging or limiting for public action. Hans Rosling\u2019s Factfulness, for example, highlights common biases and inattention to facts surrounding global poverty eradication and development, and their implications for action. A focus on relative poverty reduction goals, such as in target 1.2 of the Sustainable Development Goals (By 2030, reduce at least by half the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions), severely downplays the large improvements in multidimensional poverty in the countries that face the highest poverty rates, including many countries in Africa, which can perpetuate pessimistic narratives about the continent\u2019s capacity and achievements. Also contrary to the most common narrative, African countries weathered the COVID-19 crisis well, with some of the best records in sanitary and economic aspects. Nevertheless. many countries in Africa were hard hit by the subsequent effects of the pandemic on the global economy and the cost of capital. 29. A renewed focus on poverty is essential for the global development agenda. The focus should be on poverty in all its forms and dimensions, and attention should not be restricted to monetary poverty. As pragmatic and evidence-based contributions to the work of the Council and of Member States in the relevant forums, the Committee recommends the following: (a) Measurement of poverty: the ambitions set out in the 2030 Agenda call for integrated, strategic policy responses that can address multiple deprivations. This in turn requires that the interlinkages between different dimensions of well-being or of deprivation be visible. Multidimensional metrics on non-monetary poverty provide more useful information than dashboards in this respect, enabling integrated action. The Committee recommends using a combination of global and national multidimensional poverty indices. For example, the global multidimensional poverty index of the United Nations Development Programme and the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative and national multidimensional poverty indices (currently reported as Sustainable Development Goal indicator 1.2.2) can be reported alongside the international poverty line and national monetary poverty measures. E/2025/33 14/28 25-04788 Such poverty indices should be integrated into convergence analysis to track progress for groups left behind across multiple dimensions; (b) Relative and absolute poverty reduction: using only relative poverty reduction measures can underplay the very significant advances made by many of the poorest countries, which deserve recognition and sustained support and provide lessons for other countries and jurisdictions. While the fastest relative reductions in multidimensional poverty are not in least developed countries, some of the fastest absolute reductions are.",

While the fastest relative reductions in multidimensional poverty are not in least developed countries, some of the fastest absolute reductions are. Absolute changes in poverty rates and information on the number of people exiting poverty should be highlighted alongside relative poverty reduction, expanding the visibility of successes in the poorest countries; (c) Focusing on the poorest groups and leaving no one behind requires disaggregated data: the Committee stresses the importance of assessing convergence both between and within countries, recognizing intracountry disparities and people\u2019s experience of interlinked deprivations, and exploring trends among the poorest of the poor. This requires poverty metrics using data disaggregated by subnational regions or by location, age, gender, ethnicity, disability status and other context-appropriate variables. Disaggregated data can guide impactful policies, with a focus on the interlinked deprivations experienced by these groups; (d) Encouraging public action by means of communication: given the changing development context, it is crucial to communicate poverty data clearly to inform public action. This includes not only government actions but also initiatives by other stakeholders, including the general public. Clear communication of poverty metrics will help to drive coordinated efforts to address these challenges. Showcasing positive experiences based on evidence illustrates what is possible and can be a powerful incentive for action, not just by States but by all actors, particularly in challenging times. 30. The Committee will continue its work on these matters, as well as on domestic inequalities and decent employment, in its contributions to the Second World Social Summit. E/2025/33 25-04788 15/28 Chapter III Reviewing the framework for graduation from the least developed country category 31. The Committee initiated its review of the framework for graduation from the least developed country category. In view of the significant changes in the global economic and trading landscape since the General Assembly created the category over 50 years ago, it started to revisit the conceptual underpinnings of the category, the challenges with graduation, and experiences and challenges with smooth transition out of the category. It also examined the current procedures governing least developed country graduation and developed proposals for their refinement. A. Conceptual underpinnings of the least developed country category, graduation and smooth transition 32. The Committee has been entrusted with the responsibility of identifying the least developed countries and monitoring their progress since the inception of the category in 1971. Despite international consensus on the need to support least developed countries in overcoming their structural challenges by better integrating themselves into the global economy, over the first two and a half decades of the category\u2019s existence most of the least developed countries fell further behind their peers in key dimensions of sustainable development. While least developed countries have experienced some convergence since then towards other developing countries in their human and social development, particularly in the 2000s, and made notable gains in raising national incomes, most of them made only very limited progress towards structurally transforming their economies. Most recently, the intensification and increase in frequency of crises has reversed some hard-fought development gains, and prospects remain highly uncertain. 33. Momentum towards graduation has increased over the past two decades. Eight countries have graduated from the least developed country category, and 14 others have started the formal graduation process. At the same time, challenges for graduating and recently graduated countries are mounting in the face of an increase in the frequency and severity of global crises as well as of idiosyncratic factors disrupting their graduation processes. Moreover, based on current trajectories, graduation prospects appear extremely low for many of the least developed countries that are far below the thresholds for graduation. Often, these countries are in conflict or post-conflict situations, host large numbers of refugees, rely significantly on dwindling ODA for the provision of social services, and are particularly affected by climate change and environmental shocks.",

Moreover, based on current trajectories, graduation prospects appear extremely low for many of the least developed countries that are far below the thresholds for graduation. Often, these countries are in conflict or post-conflict situations, host large numbers of refugees, rely significantly on dwindling ODA for the provision of social services, and are particularly affected by climate change and environmental shocks. Perceptions of least developed country status, graduation and smooth transition are evolving. While concern over the loss of access to support measures specific to least developed countries persists, a greater number of countries are giving greater attention in their smooth transition strategies to harnessing opportunities arising from graduation and to ensuring post-graduation development momentum. 34. While international support measures have been expanding over time, they have remained insufficient. The most important measures have been in the area of trade, particularly duty-free, quota-free market access to developed and major developing country markets. However, these measures have been focused on market access, without commensurate additional support for capacity-building to remedy the supply side constraints faced by least developed countries. Consequently, many least developed countries have been unable to use some of these measures. E/2025/33 16/28 25-04788 35. Consequently, there is a need to improve the support available to all least developed countries, particularly those that have not yet reached the graduation thresholds, but also countries in the process of graduating. This, in turn, requires a broader rethinking of the support available to least developed countries, both support for integrating them better into the global economy for overcoming structural economic challenges and support for addressing persistent and recurring challenges and building resilience. Such rethinking should be approached as a long-term and inclusive undertaking based on a thorough assessment of available support that goes beyond currently available assessments. The Committee has rich experience acquired through its triennial reviews of the list of least developed countries and its monitoring of graduating and graduated countries, and it stands ready to engage in such assessment and rethinking. 36. Improved support to all least developed countries would be an essential element of a strengthened graduation framework, if it assists least developed countries in advancing towards sustainable development and becoming eligible for graduation. Strengthening the graduation framework also requires improving graduation-specific support for a smooth transition out of the category, as well as providing concrete incentives. B. Updating the graduation procedures 37. Based on its thorough review of the current graduation procedures, the Committee decided to refine the methods with which it implements its mandates in order to reduce uncertainties and to increase the transparency of the graduation framework. For the preparation and conduct of the upcoming triennial reviews, the Committee will apply the following: (a) One year after a country meets the graduation criteria for the first time, the Committee appoints one of its members as rapporteur for the country. Working closely with the Committee secretariat, the country rapporteur will assist with the identification of additional information requirements and, in case the country is subsequently recommended for graduation, the monitoring of the country under the enhanced monitoring mechanism. In preparation for the subsequent triennial review, the country rapporteur will have virtual or in-person (subject to the availability of resources) meetings with the Government and the United Nations resident coordinator. Increasing awareness and knowledge of the least developed country graduation process within the country depends predominantly on efforts made by the Government and the United Nations system; (b) At the same time, the Committee requests the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the Department of Economic and Social Affairs to identify key vulnerabilities and impacts of graduation, respectively, that could affect the sustainability of post-graduation development progress. These overviews should be drawn from the more comprehensive studies prepared by the respective entities based on the existing mandates, which should also be shared with countries and the Committee; (c) The Committee requests its secretariat to incorporate these inputs, together with information on the least developed count",

The Government may update its statement after the official preparatory meeting but before the actual triennial review; (e) If the country meets the graduation criteria for a second consecutive time at the triennial review, the Committee will recommend the country for graduation unless it finds that the least developed country criteria scores and the additional information, including the views expressed by the Government, reveal significant concerns over the sustainability of the progress achieved by meeting the graduation criteria (i.e. if the Committee identifies a significant risk that the country will cease to be eligible for graduation in the near to medium term); (f) If the Committee clearly identifies such concerns, it defers the consideration to the next triennial review. Normally, it would contemplate deferment only if requested by the Government in the written submission. If the Committee defers a country\u2019s consideration, it will request the Department of Economic and Social Affairs and UNCTAD to update their inputs to the graduation assessment for the next triennial review, and request its secretariat to prepare an updated graduation assessment; (g) The Committee has consistently found that countries require a five-year preparatory period to prepare themselves effectively for graduation. While the standard length of the preparatory period remains three years, the Committee will normally include in a recommendation for graduation a statement that the countries require an extended period of five years (see para. 39 (e) below); (h) The Committee monitors the development progress of graduating and recently graduated countries within its enhanced monitoring mechanism, which includes consultations with the country concerned. Consultations will also be held with countries whose graduation has been deferred; (i) The Committee would recommend an extension within the enhanced monitoring mechanism if requested by the country in writing and if the Committee finds that external shocks significantly disrupt the preparations for graduation or create a significant risk for the country no longer meeting the criteria in the foreseeable future. 38. The Committee will take these refinements into account when reviewing the least developed country graduation criteria and indicators and the supplementary graduation indicators for the 2027 triennial review, together with its long-standing principles for reviewing the criteria, to reflect advances in development thinking and data availability. 39. While these measures should already contribute to improving the graduation procedures, the Committee reiterates its previous findings that the existing General Assembly resolutions on smooth transition (resolutions 59/209 and 67/221) require updating that should, among other things, strengthen the graduation procedures. The Committee suggests that such strengthening include considering the following proposals: (a) Consolidate all key provisions regarding the graduation procedures in the resolution; (b) Request relevant United Nations entities to support the country in starting to prepare for graduation after the country meets the graduation criteria for the first time; (c) Request countries considered for graduation to submit a written statement (see para. 37 (d) above) as an input to the triennial review; E/2025/33 18/28 25-04788 (d) Provide guidance on deferments by the Council of the Committee\u2019s recommendations and the distinctive functions of the Council and the General Assembly in the graduation process.",

IV); (j) Introduce a readmittance procedure for recently graduated countries that no longer meet the graduation criteria during the nine-year transition period. The procedure could follow the same format as in cases of graduating countries no longer meeting the criteria (see subpara. (g) above). 40. As reported previously, the update of the resolution on smooth transition would also allow the provision of additional guidance on smooth transition strategies and, most importantly, an opportunity to agree on strengthened graduation support measures and on international incentives for graduation.

E/2025/33 25-04788 19/28 Chapter IV Enhanced monitoring of countries that are graduating or have graduated from the list of least developed countries A. Introduction 41. As mandated in Council resolution 2024/7 and General Assembly resolution 67/221, the Committee monitored the development progress of two recently graduated countries, namely Bhutan and Sao Tome and Principe, and six graduating countries, namely Bangladesh, Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Nepal, Senegal and Solomon Islands. The detailed monitoring reports, with recommendations on policy priorities and support needs, as well as the full reports submitted by the countries, are available on the Committee\u2019s website. The table below shows the least developed country criteria scores vis-\u00e0-vis the graduation thresholds established in the 2024 triennial review of least developed countries.

Bhutan graduated in December 2023 and swiftly recovered from multiple global crises, resuming its path of progress. In July 2024, it began implementing its thirteenth five-year plan, which has been designated as a smooth transition strategy for sustainable graduation. Close monitoring of current account deficits is important, and longer-term challenges include economic diversification, reducing dependence on hydropower exports and strengthening resilience to environmental changes. The E/2025/33 20/28 25-04788 Committee continues to caution that the goal of achieving high-income status by 2034 may be overly ambitious. It recommends prioritizing advancements in productive capacity, particularly through digitalization of the service sector. It also recognizes and supports the call of Bhutan for continued international assistance, particularly access to financial resources, to address the challenges of being a small landlocked country and vulnerable to climate change. Sao Tome and Principe 43. Sao Tome and Principe graduated from the least developed country category in December 2024. Instead of preparing a separate smooth transition strategy, the Government chose to integrate key smooth transition measures into its national development plan, making the effective implementation of the plan crucial for a smooth transition. The country faces major macroeconomic challenges, including slow GDP growth, high inflation, substantial debt and ongoing external vulnerabilities. The Committee recommends prioritizing smooth transition actions to shift from an aid-dependent economy to one driven by a stronger private sector. C. Graduating countries Bangladesh 44. Bangladesh remains well on track towards sustainable graduation. It has managed to mitigate some of the adverse effects posed by multiple global crises. The interim Government formed following a student-led uprising in 2024 has launched critical policy reforms aimed at revitalizing the economy and overcoming current macroeconomic challenges. The country is expected to soon start implementing its comprehensive smooth transition strategy, which was validated in 2024 and is aimed at guiding the transition of Bangladesh towards a structurally transformed and competitive economy. Given the importance of least developed country-specific support measures to the development progress achieved, there is an urgent need for the international community, including the trading and development partners of Bangladesh and the United Nations, to provide it with the necessary support. Cambodia 45. Cambodia has achieved sustained and rapid economic growth and successfully become a graduating country, meeting all three least developed country graduation criteria with significant margins. Cambodia has been granted a five-year preparatory period, and the Committee welcomes the Government\u2019s strong commitment to graduation, recognizing it as a milestone in the country\u2019s socioeconomic progress. Key challenges ahead include sustaining inclusive growth, diversifying export markets and addressing the impact of slowing growth among major trading partners. The Committee advises Cambodia to continue to strengthen institutional arrangements and integrate its smooth transition strategy into the implementation of its national development plan. Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic 46. The Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic continues to meet all least developed country criteria and to make progress towards sustainable graduation. The Government\u2019s continued effort to implement the smooth transition strategy, which was adopted in 2023 following a thorough and effective preparation, underscores its commitment to progress. Despite successfully navigating many challenges, the country faces notable difficulties with high inflation, decreasing currency value and mounting debt levels which are mutually reinforcing. The Committee advises E/2025/33 25-04788 21/28 continued implementation of appropriate fiscal and monetary policies to address these issues and to enhance stability of the economy, in line with the implementation of the smooth transition strategy and other relevant strategies, and emphasizes the importance of international support for the management, restructuring and reduction of debt, as well as economic diversification. Nepal 47. Nepal continues to advance steadily towards sustainable graduation. For the first time, it meets all three graduation criteria, including the income criterion.",

      "text": "vises E/2025/33 25-04788 21/28 continued implementation of appropriate fiscal and monetary policies to address these issues and to enhance stability of the economy, in line with the implementation of the smooth transition strategy and other relevant strategies, and emphasizes the importance of international support for the management, restructuring and reduction of debt, as well as economic diversification. Nepal 47. Nepal continues to advance steadily towards sustainable graduation. For the first time, it meets all three graduation criteria, including the income criterion. While the economy experienced a significant slowdown due to multiple global crises and has faced macroeconomic challenges, recovery has been relatively swift, particularly with the revival of the tourism and manufacturing sectors. Sustained efforts in implementing effective policies focused on economic diversification, trade policy in synergy with investment promotion, and disaster risk reduction will be critical to achieving sustainable graduation. The Government is implementing the smooth transition strategy, in line with the national development plan. Senegal 48. Senegal has made significant advances and is scheduled to graduate in 2029. It currently faces significant challenges, including a high fiscal deficit and rising public and external debt, and high vulnerability to climate change. The current account deficit, which had worsened significantly in recent years, is expected to improve with the expansion of hydrocarbon production and exports. The Government has developed a road map for a smooth transition and is advancing on the measures identified. Going forward, critical areas of action are improving the educational system and its outcomes, addressing inequalities and implementing strategies for economic diversification, industrialization, and scientific and technological advancement, issues prioritized in the development vision adopted in 2024. Solomon Islands 49. Solomon Islands remains on track to graduate in December 2027 but continues to expand its economy only moderately, with growth rates considerably below national and international targets. The country faces continued challenges to diversifying its economy and to building resilience against climate shocks. The country has developed a smooth transition strategy following broad consultations, which is currently awaiting endorsement by the Government. The Committee recommends that United Nations entities continue to support the country in implementing the strategy. D. Deferred countries 50. The Committee welcomed the consultations it held with Kiribati and Tuvalu and looks forward to continuing its consultations with both countries, as well as with Djibouti. These three countries, having been recommended by the Committee for graduation in 2018, 2012 and 2024, respectively, continue to meet the gross national income per capita and human assets index criteria, all three with wide margins for income and both island States also with wide margins for the human assets index criterion. However, all three are among the most vulnerable countries in the world, according to their economic and environmental vulnerability index scores. The Committee reiterates that graduation must not be seen as a signal that these countries no longer need special treatment. The extreme and long-lasting vulnerability of these countries requires specific, targeted, sustained and easily accessible financial and E/2025/33 22/28 25-04788 technical support that is outside the scope of least developed country-specific support measures. E. Enhanced monitoring mechanism 51. The Committee reviewed the structure and functioning of the enhanced monitoring mechanism to further improve its effectiveness, drawing on lessons learned from its implementation. The mechanism has leveraged existing national and international monitoring processes, incorporating factors related to disruptive events that may impact the smooth transition out of the least developed country category, as well as considering the short- and long-term socioeconomic and environmental challenges. 52. The mechanism has received strong support from Member States, as reflected, inter alia, in multiple Council and General Assembly resolutions, including the Doha Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries, as well as in the Ministerial Declaration of the Least Developed Countries. 53. The annual monitoring process within the mechanism has improved significantly, leading to a rise in country participation. The share of countries submitting national reports on smooth transition has increased, from 13 per cent during 2009\u20132021 to 61 per cent in the period from 2022 to 2025. 54.",

The annual monitoring process within the mechanism has improved significantly, leading to a rise in country participation. The share of countries submitting national reports on smooth transition has increased, from 13 per cent during 2009\u20132021 to 61 per cent in the period from 2022 to 2025. 54. The crisis response process was introduced to provide continuous monitoring of shocks and emergencies. Solomon Islands became the first country to trigger the process, which ultimately led to a three-year extension of its preparatory period. However, several challenges have emerged in the operation of the process, including the insufficient availability of high-frequency data, the reluctance of countries to declare crises due to concerns about negative international perceptions, and a lack of clear guidelines on response actions. 55. Support linked to the mechanism has been strengthened but remains limited to the length of the preparatory period. The case of Solomon Islands showcases the support provided under the mechanism, by extending the preparatory period for least developed country graduation, and the case of Angola demonstrates that cases of countries failing to meet the graduation criteria during the preparatory period can be effectively addressed through the mechanism. At the same time, there has been little progress or demand to link the mechanism to other forms of support. 56. Based on these findings, the Committee suggests the way forward as follows: (a) Monitoring graduating and graduated countries must consider critical global challenges: (i) stagnation in ODA, with increased focused on refugees and the impacts of worldwide geopolitical tensions; (ii) limited capitalization of multilateral development banks, affecting financing for the Sustainable Development Goals and climate adaptation; and (iii) stagnation in global trade amid increasing restrictions. Country-specific impacts of these issues will be discussed in consultations with the countries; (b) Reliable and timely data are crucial for the enhanced monitoring mechanism, but significant gaps remain in countries being monitored. The Committee proposes recommendations on data improvement in the countries monitored and calls for the support of the international community as follows: (i) improve frequency, accuracy and transparency; (ii) enhance data resilience and sensitivity analysis; (iii) strengthen national statistical capacity; (iv) strengthen partnerships of national authorities with resident coordinator offices, the Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small E/2025/33 25-04788 23/28 Island Developing States, regional commissions, and alternative data sources; (v) explore mechanisms to enhance data quality and accessibility (vi) promote the use of early warning indicators; and (vii) align data improvement needs through the Doha Programme of Action road map; (c) The Committee will continue to improve annual monitoring reports, further align the use of its supplementary graduation indicators, incorporating information additional to standardized indicators, inputs from United Nations entities, and national reports on smooth transition. The Committee will further strengthen its comparative analysis of development progress and increase the focus on the development and implementation of smooth transition strategies. Monitoring reports will assess risks of countries no longer meeting graduation criteria and discuss support under the crisis response process when necessary. Countries will be encouraged to include their own smooth transition strategy monitoring and evaluation indicators for a comprehensive assessment. To enhance engagement, in-person consultations will be held where possible. The Committee\u2019s country rapporteur will continue to play a key role in monitoring the country and preparing policy recommendations. To align with evolving needs and the move from once-a-year to continuous monitoring, the post-graduation monitoring period may be standardized to nine years for consistency and clarity (see chap. III); (d) The Committee stresses that the main objective of the crisis response process is to enable action related to graduation, particularly concerning the graduation timing, throughout the year if necessary. While formal triggering of the process will require a written request from the Government, the Committee may initiate the process in case of extreme climate events or conflict situations.",

While formal triggering of the process will require a written request from the Government, the Committee may initiate the process in case of extreme climate events or conflict situations. The Committee may also flag concerns and initiate consultations based on internal reviews of high-frequency data. The Committee will assess, in a timely manner, whether the external shocks significantly impair the preparations for graduation or cause significant risk that the country will no longer meet the graduation criteria. It will request inputs from the Department of Economic and Social Affairs and UNCTAD, as well as regional commissions and resident coordinator offices. If timing allows, crisis assessments may be integrated into annual monitoring reports; (e) The Committee\u2019s direct role in graduation support is currently limited to preparatory period extensions, although it stands ready to provide its expertise in cases where a graduating or recently graduated country no longer meets the graduation criteria (ibid.). The Committee reaffirms its earlier recommendations to the Council, the General Assembly and United Nations agencies to enhance graduation-specific support, including: (i) mobilize United Nations crisis management expertise for external shocks affecting graduation; (ii) organize round- table discussions with development and trading partners, including South-South cooperation providers; (iii) integrate graduation discussions into Council forums and General Assembly meetings; (iv) strengthen capacity-building initiatives for the enhanced monitoring mechanism through United Nations-wide efforts; and (v) operationalize the Sustainable Graduation Support Facility (iGrad) under the Office of the High Representative. E/2025/33 24/28 25-04788 Chapter V Future work of the Committee 57. The Committee will continue to align its work programme with the needs and priorities established by the Council, with a view to contributing effectively to the Council\u2019s deliberations and assisting it in the performance of its functions. In that framework, the Committee will continue to examine new development pathways in the context of fundamental shifts and evolving global contexts. 58. The Committee will continue its conceptual work related to the least developed country graduation framework, focusing on the overall support framework for least developed countries and giving particular attention to the reasons why several least developed countries are not progressing towards graduation. It will also review the least developed country criteria and the supplementary graduation indicators, as well as their application procedures, so that they can be applied at the 2027 triennial review. 59. In accordance with its mandates, the Committee will continue to monitor the development progress of recently graduated and currently graduating countries. It will hold consultations with these countries, as well as with those whose graduation has been deferred, in accordance with Council resolution 2024/7 and General Assembly resolution 76/258. The Committee remains committed to further improving the enhanced monitoring mechanism to accommodate evolving circumstances. E/2025/33 25-04788 25/28 Chapter VI Organization of the session 60.

The Associate Director noted the alignment of priorities with government partners and emphasized the importance of clear commitments around leadership in the new Action Plan. 57. A group of delegations highlighted the importance of access to comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services and sexuality education for adolescents as priorities for the next Gender Action Plan. The group noted that sexual and reproductive health and rights were important not only for the health and well-being of adolescent girls, but also for their empowerment and full participation in society. 58. Multiple delegations highlighted specific priority areas, including maternal health, human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, HIV, nutrition, inclusive education, skills, prevention and response to gender-based violence and digital safety. The Associate Director welcomed the alignment of those priorities with UNICEF work. She noted progress on HPV vaccination and described UNICEF plans to add value to vaccination campaigns by providing additional support such as menstrual health supplies and referrals to specialized services. E. UNICEF programme cooperation Extensions of ongoing country programmes 59. The Vice-President of the Executive Board stated that, in accordance with Executive Board decision 2009/11, the Executive Board had been informed of the first one-year extensions of the country programmes for Guatemala and South Sudan, which had been approved by the Executive Director and was contained in document E/ICEF/2025/P/L.8. 60. The Executive Board adopted decision 2025/10 under agenda item 20 (see annex). F. Update on protection from sexual exploitation and abuse 61. The Director, Division of Data Analytics, Planning and Monitoring, presented the Update on protection from sexual exploitation and abuse, contained in document E/ICEF/2025/16. 62. A group of delegations welcomed UNICEF efforts towards ensuring protection from and response to sexual exploitation, abuse and sexual harassment. The group praised steps taken to reinforce a survivor/victim-centred approach and zero tolerance for sexual exploitation and abuse, and welcomed efforts to ensure an inclusive, diverse and safe organizational culture to help address root causes. The group emphasized that preventing and addressing sexual exploitation and abuse should be treated as a core function and asked how UNICEF would ensure that sexual exploitation and abuse prevention and response continued to improve amid funding pressures. The Director acknowledged that concern and said that UNICEF was working to ensure that existing capabilities continued while preventing fragmentation and focusing on an integrated approach that consolidated different risk areas, including sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment. 63. The group of delegations commended UNICEF for its efforts to roll out the Policy on Safeguarding and asked where UNICEF saw further opportunities for E/2025/34 (Part II) E/ICEF/2025/7 (Part II) 11/25 25-12149 inter-agency collaboration in a manner that was both efficient and effective. The Director said that it was an area of active collaboration and that many United Nations agencies had approached UNICEF about sharing its safeguarding framework. She said that an overarching safeguarding framework, including but not limited to sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment, would benefit all agencies. 64. The group of delegations noted that UNICEF was assessing the feasibility of implementing the Misconduct Disclosure Scheme and asked about the status of that work, considering that other agencies had already implemented pilots. The Director confirmed that UNICEF would be piloting the Scheme. 65. The group of delegations raised concerns about replacing existing sexual exploitation and abuse complaint mechanisms with a new all-inclusive complaints feedback mechanism. The Director said that UNICEF had worked carefully with the Office of Internal Audit and Investigations and other relevant parts of the organization to ensure harmonization with complaints and feedback management principles while maintaining confidentiality. 66.",

The group of delegations raised concerns about replacing existing sexual exploitation and abuse complaint mechanisms with a new all-inclusive complaints feedback mechanism. The Director said that UNICEF had worked carefully with the Office of Internal Audit and Investigations and other relevant parts of the organization to ensure harmonization with complaints and feedback management principles while maintaining confidentiality. 66. One delegation commended the UNICEF strategy to protect against sexual exploitation and abuse and emphasized the importance of creating conditions for senior leadership to strengthen protection efforts. The Director welcomed the support of the delegation and the forward-looking statements on addressing those issues. 67. The Executive Board adopted decision 2025/11 under agenda item 20 (see annex). G. Update on organizational culture and diversity 68. The Principal Adviser, Division of People and Culture, introduced the Update on organizational culture and diversity, contained in document E/ICEF/2025/17. The Ombudsman of the United Nations Funds and Programmes then presented the 2024 annual report of that office. 69. A group of delegations commended UNICEF for its impressive results in advancing the rights of persons with disabilities, particularly noting the whole-of- organization approach to disability. The group encouraged UNICEF to maintain that course and ensure that any changes and reforms were implemented with a continued commitment to advancing the rights of persons with disabilities. The Principal Adviser welcomed the recognition of UNICEF work on disability inclusion and referred to the existing Disability Inclusion Policy and Strategy, with many targets to be met by 2030. 70. A group of delegations welcomed the consistent commitment demonstrated by UNICEF to improving its organizational culture and diversity, equity and inclusion. The group noted that the 2024 Global Staff Survey suggested that concerns persisted in some areas, such as women sharing less-positive feedback and resigning at higher rates than men. The group asked how UNICEF planned to address these disparities and further improve psychological safety and trust among staff. The Principal Adviser acknowledged that some areas needed improvement and said that UNICEF was providing guidance to divisions and offices that scored low in the survey to develop robust action plans. He noted that exit interviews suggested issues relating to work- life balance and career progression, and that UNICEF had family-friendly policies, including a flexible work arrangement procedure. 71. A group of delegations noted that culture audits had not taken place and asked whether UNICEF was still planning for such audits in the future. The Principal Adviser said that there was no current plan for a culture audit, as UNICEF was waiting E/2025/34 (Part II) E/ICEF/2025/7 (Part II) 25-12149 12/25 for results from the ongoing human resource management evaluation, which also included organizational culture in its scope. 72. A group of delegations recognized that major organizational restructuring brought uncertainty to staff and called on UNICEF to ensure that personnel were placed at the centre of the transition. The Principal Adviser said that UNICEF had open channels through employee resource groups where the voices of all staff were considered when developing people-centric policies. 73. The Executive Board adopted decision 2025/12 under agenda item 20 (see annex). H. Update on UNICEF efforts to address racism and racial discrimination 74. The Principal Adviser, Division of People and Culture, presented the Update on UNICEF efforts to address racism and racial discrimination, contained in document E/ICEF/2025/18/Rev.1. 75. A group of delegations expressed appreciation for the update and acknowledged the considerable efforts undertaken to eliminate racism, while noting that racial discrimination still persisted. The group condemned racism and racial discrimination in all its forms and stated that it should have no place in UNICEF, the wider United Nations system or anywhere. The group commended UNICEF for making progress and identifying gaps, including gaps in fair representation that had been identified following implementation of the whole-of-diversity approach in 2024. The group encouraged transparency around challenges in addressing racial discrimination and requested reporting on complaints of racial discrimination received by the Office of Internal Audit and Investigations under the agenda item. The Principal Adviser welcomed those comments. 76.",

The group encouraged transparency around challenges in addressing racial discrimination and requested reporting on complaints of racial discrimination received by the Office of Internal Audit and Investigations under the agenda item. The Principal Adviser welcomed those comments. 76. The group noted that implementation of recommendations requiring inter-agency efforts continued to lag and encouraged UNICEF to prioritize efforts to address recommendations on a common set of categories for voluntary self- identification and other efforts to strengthen collaboration on anti-racism. The Principal Adviser acknowledged that the United Nations system was not moving as fast as desired on the categorization recommendation and said that UNICEF had been pushing for progress, noting that the Human Resources Network within the High- level Committee on Management remained committed to addressing the agenda. 77. The group asked what UNICEF was doing to ensure that racism and racial discrimination were prevented and addressed within implementing partner organizations at the country level. The Principal Adviser said that the issues were part of UNICEF safeguarding processes and would be looked into further. I. Update on implementation efforts on the repositioning of the United Nations development system 78. The Deputy Executive Director, Partnerships, introduced the Update on implementation efforts on the repositioning of the United Nations development system. The Director, Public Partnerships Division, presented the update. 79. A group of delegations expressed satisfaction with progress on the United Nations development system reform. They welcomed the Secretary-General\u2019s UN80 Initiative, which must build on \u2013 not bypass \u2013 the reforms already under way. The group stressed the need for further consolidation of shared services, common back E/2025/34 (Part II) E/ICEF/2025/7 (Part II) 13/25 25-12149 offices and common premises, and requested information on actions taken by UNICEF to further consolidate joint business operations. In response, the Director, Public Partnerships Division, stressed that reform was embedded in UNICEF ways of working and highlighted UNICEF active involvement in the UN80 Initiative. On business operations, she noted that UNICEF offered shared services to other agencies and benefited from services provided by others. She emphasized that efficiency required mutual engagement from all partners. 80. The group of delegations noted with concern that progress in implementing the Management and Accountability Framework had stalled, including with regard to the dual reporting model, and requested information on challenges faced by UNICEF in that area. The Director, Public Partnerships Division, said that UNICEF was fully committed to dual reporting and regularly sent guidance to country representatives to contribute to resident coordinator performance appraisals. She reiterated UNICEF commitment to actively contribute to the next iteration of the review of the Management and Accountability Framework to address those issues, with a shift of focus from compliance to impact and results. 81. One delegation reiterated the importance of ensuring derivation of draft country programme documents from the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Frameworks. The Director, Public Partnerships Division, confirmed that UNICEF had a 100 per cent compliance rate with the exercise, which was always attested by a letter from the resident coordinator. The Deputy Executive Director, Partnerships, further outlined the accountability process at country, regional and headquarter levels to ensure full compliance with alignment and derivation. 82. One delegation asked about the decline in satisfaction rates among UNICEF country offices with resident coordinator support, and requested information on possible reasons and measures to improve the situation. The delegation also raised concerns about dissatisfaction with country-based pooled funds, noting that some UNICEF Representatives found the process regarding accessing those funds cumbersome. The Director, Public Partnerships Division, acknowledged that some Country Representatives felt that collaboration processes were not boosting collective impact for children and said that UNICEF was working to identify and replicate successful coordination models. The Deputy Executive Director, Partnerships, emphasized that pooled funds were an important mechanism but represented only one funding source and had to be complemented by core resources and flexible funding, as stated in the funding compact. 83.",

One delegation expressed concern about agencies considering reducing funding to the resident coordinator system via the cost-share mechanism. The Deputy Executive Director, Partnerships, explained that as overall funding decreased, contributions to the resident coordinator system would naturally decline, which was a consequence of reduced funding rather than intent to undermine the system. 84. The Executive Board adopted decision 2025/13 under agenda item 20 (see annex). J. Evaluation reports and management responses Annual report for 2024 on the evaluation function in UNICEF, and management response 85. The Director of Evaluation presented the Annual report for 2024 on the evaluation function in UNICEF, contained in document E/ICEF/2025/23. The Director, Division of Data, Analytics, Planning and Monitoring, presented the Management response to the annual report, contained in document E/ICEF/2025/24. E/2025/34 (Part II) E/ICEF/2025/7 (Part II) 25-12149 14/25 86. One delegation commended the important work of the Evaluation Office, particularly the use of impact evaluations, and encouraged UNICEF to strengthen its focus on outcome-level change. The delegation noted that the timeliness of management responses had declined and asked how UNICEF would improve that. The delegation also noted a decrease in evaluations covering humanitarian action and asked how UNICEF would ensure that humanitarian action received necessary evaluation attention. In response, the Director of Evaluation acknowledged that the timeliness of management responses remained a concern and said that the function was working to synthesize recurring recommendations to address systemic issues more efficiently. He said that the function had recruited a third fixed-term position to support humanitarian evaluations and was implementing surge capacity within the function. The Director, Division of Data, Analytics, Planning and Monitoring, said that as the topics covered by evaluations became more complex and strategic, meaningful management responses could take time to develop and finalize. She emphasized that the increased focus on impact- and outcome-level evaluations was important, even if it meant that developing high-quality management responses could take longer than the 60-day target. 87. One delegation expressed concern that although evaluations incorporated gender and disability lenses more systematically, meaningful incorporation of gender concerns remained low. The Director of Evaluation acknowledged that improvements could be made in that area and said that greater quality assurance was being applied, with terms of reference now receiving heightened scrutiny for meaningful gender questions. 88. A group of delegations commended the evaluation function for its achievements, particularly the commitment to generating high-quality evidence in the draft UNICEF Strategic Plan, 2026\u20132029. The group expressed concern that funding remained an issue and encouraged UNICEF to remain committed to achieving this target. The group urged UNICEF management to consult with the Director of the Evaluation before undertaking any restructuring or cost-cutting measures to ensure that the integrity and operational capacity of the function were not compromised. In response to the concern surrounding the timeliness of management response, the Director of Evaluation emphasized that it was important to distinguish between the role of the evaluation function in fostering meaningful management responses and that of management, and of the importance of both parties working together to address the issue. The Director, Division of Data, Analytics, Planning and Monitoring, said that management wanted to focus on the utility of evaluations and work with the Evaluation Office to strengthen ways to frame recommendations that improved responses. The Deputy Executive Director, Management, acknowledged the advice from the Audit Advisory Committee to look at criteria including the 1 per cent target and said that management would take a holistic perspective, considering evaluation as one tool among others in the organization. 89.

The Director, Ethics Office, presented the Report of the Ethics Office of UNICEF for 2024, contained in document E/ICEF/2025/21. The Principal Adviser, Division of People and Culture, presented the Management response to the report of the Ethics Office of UNICEF for 2024, contained in document E/ICEF/2025/22. E/2025/34 (Part II) E/ICEF/2025/7 (Part II) 15/25 25-12149 91. One delegation commended the Ethics Office for its work and emphasized that adequate, predictable and sustainable staffing and financing were key. The delegation also called on senior management to demonstrate an ethical culture during organizational changes and called on UNICEF to prioritize development and finalization of the Ethics Office charter for Executive Board review. In response, the Director, Ethics Office, said that the Office had identified drafting of the charter as a priority, having paused to await completion of system-wide initiatives, including the United Nations Secretariat updated review of its legal bulletin on the ethics function across the United Nations, as well as standards of practice to guide the ethics function developed through the Ethics Network of Multilateral Organizations. He said that those processes had been completed and that the Office hoped to present a draft charter in 2026. 92. One delegation noted the increase in formal allegations of retaliation under the revised policy. The delegation asked whether the definition had brought about the increase in allegations and requested information about early detection of ethical risks. The Director, Ethics Office confirmed that there had been an increase in formal cases filed and suggested that the increase could indicate that staff felt confident to come forward. He explained that early detection was achieved through increased field outreach involving one-on-one consultations, the Ethics and Culture Champions programme, and greater engagement from leadership. 93. The Principal Adviser, Division of People and Culture, acknowledged the importance of senior management modelling organizational values and mentioned the Managing People with Purpose programme launched for all 6,500 supervisors in the organization, which addressed ethics, compliance and good management. The Deputy Executive Director, Management, acknowledged concerns about financing for independent functions, noting that core resources were stagnant or declining and would decrease significantly by next year, with UNICEF facing significant cuts across its structure. 94. The Executive Board adopted decision 2025/15 under agenda item 20 (see annex). L. Internal audit and investigations UNICEF Office of Internal Audit and Investigations 2024 annual report to the Executive Board, and management response 95. The Director, Office of Internal Audit and Investigations, presented the UNICEF Office of Internal Audit and Investigations 2024 annual report to the Executive Board, contained in document E/ICEF/2025/AB/L.3, which was accompanied by two addenda. The Deputy Executive Director, Management, introduced the Management response to the 2024 annual report, contained in document E/ICEF/2025/AB/L.4, which was then presented by the Deputy Director, Division of Financial and Administrative Management. 96. Multiple delegations commended the Office of Internal Audit and Investigations on the annual report. A group of delegations commended the general finding that the Office did not identify any indications that UNICEF governance, risk management and control processes were inadequate or ineffective. Multiple delegations stressed the importance of adequacy of resources and funding for the Office. 97. A group of delegations asked what UNICEF could do to reduce fraud risk in the future. The Director, Office of Internal Audit and Investigations, acknowledged the low fraud detection rate and explained that UNICEF had launched a significant anti-fraud effort, including a new anti-fraud policy issued in May 2025, creation of E/2025/34 (Part II) E/ICEF/2025/7 (Part II) 25-12149 16/25 an anti-fraud officer post, operationalization of a dedicated fraud team within the Office, and establish",

The Deputy Executive Director, Management, confirmed that efforts were under way to roll out the new anti-fraud policy. 98. A group of delegations noted that the Office continued to face difficulties in accessing critical information from subcontractors and government partners due to the absence of formal agreements, and questioned how that would be remedied. The Director, Office of Internal Audit and Investigations, said that UNICEF had strong contractual arrangements with private sector and civil society implementing partners, but faced challenges with government partners where contractual relationships were limited. 99. One delegation expressed concern about the increase in reported allegations and asked how the Office interpreted that trend. The Director, Office of Internal Audit and Investigations, said that the trend was unsurprising for an organization of the size and complexity of UNICEF and emphasized the importance of strengthening systems and governance. One delegation requested information on the extent of recovery from the reported financial losses of $460,471.41. 100. Several delegations raised concerns about a potential backlog of open cases. One delegation requested an update on whether the new P3 post approved in 2024 to manage the increase in cases of sexual exploitation and abuse for implementing partners was filled and how it impacted the caseload. The Director, Office of Internal Audit and Investigations, acknowledged resource challenges, and noted that the Office was seeking ways to become more efficient. The Director explained that while the P-3 post had not yet been filled, a senior investigator was on temporary loan from a sister United Nations agency to help to manage the workload. 101. One delegation asked about lessons learned from investigations and management letters issued. The Deputy Director, Division of Financial and Administrative Management, explained that lessons from fraud and protection from sexual exploitation and abuse cases informed policy development work, with observations and recommendation raised in audits directly informing policies and procedures. 102. One delegation noted the reference to an external review of the anti-fraud framework and asked whether its findings would be shared with the Board. The Deputy Executive Director, Management, explained that the new anti-fraud and corruption policy had been issued, and the focus was now on its comprehensive roll- out, including training, system improvements and dialogue with partners. 103. One delegation expressed appreciation for the last-mile supply monitoring tool piloted by UNICEF and asked when it would be evaluated and potentially scaled up. The Deputy Director, Division of Financial and Administrative Management, said that the pilot results were forthcoming and that the plan was to broaden the use of the tool within the next 6 to 12 months, based on the results of the pilot. 104. The Executive Board adopted decision 2025/16 under agenda item 20 (see annex). UNICEF Audit Advisory Committee 2024 annual report to the Executive Board 105. A member of the Audit Advisory Committee shared the findings from the UNICEF Audit Advisory Committee 2024 annual report with the Executive Board.

A representative of the working group on implementing Executive Board decision 2024/15 on the assessment of how the Executive Board executed its governance and oversight functions presented an update. 108. A group of delegations welcomed the update and commended the working group on its progress and flexible approach, and the development of working methods with clearly defined phases and thematic workstreams. 109. The group noted that some recommendations required preliminary stocktaking before implementation could begin and emphasized that such work should be supported by relevant actors. The representative of the Joint Inspection Unit working group welcomed the comments. N. Annual report on the risk profile of UNICEF 110. The Deputy Executive Director, Management, introduced the Annual report on the risk profile of UNICEF, contained in document E/ICEF/2025/25. The Chief Risk Officer presented the report. 111. Delegations welcomed the report. One delegation expressed appreciation for the harmonized and bottom-up approach to annual risk reviews and reporting from country offices, regions and divisions. The delegation also expressed appreciation for the willingness of UNICEF to engage in shared risk dialogues with the Executive Board and asked about systematizing risk dialogues at the country level with partners and how UNICEF was mitigating the impact of decreased funds and core resources on risk capacity, particularly in country offices.

The Director, Private Fundraising and Partnerships, presented the report. 116. A group of delegations expressed appreciation to the Director, Private Fundraising and Partnerships, for the presentation and for the dedicated work of the team. The group commended the Private Fundraising and Partnerships team for their continued success in mobilizing significant private sector resources, even in a difficult fundraising environment. The group welcomed the integrated approach taken by UNICEF through its new Private Sector Engagement Strategy, noting that by connecting fundraising, partnerships, advocacy and communications in a more targeted and strategic manner, UNICEF was setting a strong foundation for future success. The group emphasized the importance of innovation and diversification of funding sources and highlighted the role of country offices in developing new partnerships and entering emerging markets, particularly in middle-income countries. The group stated that as public budgets tightened and global needs increased, it remained committed to supporting efforts by UNICEF to strengthen private sector collaboration, explore new innovative finance instruments and scale up successful ones, in line with rules and regulations. The Director, Private Fundraising and Partnerships, thanked the group for the support and positive feedback. She emphasized that while the private sector had massive potential, it would not replace the public sector, and that both sectors needed to work together. She noted that private sector engagement was not only about financial resources but also about leveraging core expertise to solve global problems and challenges programmatically. 117. The Chair of the Standing Group of National Committees said that National Committees were collectively the largest single source of resources for UNICEF, providing $1.466 billion in 2024. He emphasized that beyond financial resources, National Committees contributed public education campaigns, advocacy, brand and marketing work, and engagement with the private sector. The Chair said that at a time of tremendous challenge and change, National Committees remained committed to supporting UNICEF and working collaboratively to advance their shared responsibility towards children. 118.

Address by the Chairperson of the UNICEF Global Staff Association 119. The Chairperson of the UNICEF Global Staff Association made a statement on behalf of UNICEF staff around the world. She described the significant structural and financial shifts due to recent funding reductions, which had heightened anxiety and mental health strain throughout the organization. The Chairperson expressed concerns about operational coherence and equity in workload as changes unfolded. She emphasized the impact on early and mid-career professionals facing uncertainty and highlighted ethical concerns regarding programme phase-outs and the discontinuation of the special education grant for staff with children with special needs. The Chairperson noted that the restructuring process had affected many staff representatives within the Staff Association network, potentially weakening its capacity at a time when strong representation was most needed. She reaffirmed the Association\u2019s commitment to advocating for transparency, fairness and dignity in organizational transitions. 120. A group of delegations thanked the Chairperson for her address and expressed heartfelt gratitude to every UNICEF staff member who worked tirelessly under challenging conditions to support children. The group recognized that budget cuts and necessary savings translated into significant challenges and uncertainty for staff, severely impacting their families. The group stressed the necessity of prioritizing field and front-line staff and called on UNICEF to prioritize the well-being of those affected by reforms while continuing to pursue initiatives on workplace culture, protection from sexual exploitation and abuse, and organizational culture improvements. The Chairperson thanked the delegations for their support and said that she would relay their strong support to colleagues and the staff representative network. Q.

Draft decisions recommended by the Permanent Forum for adoption by the Council 1. The Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues recommends to the Economic and Social Council the adoption of the following draft decisions: Draft decision I International expert group meeting on the theme \u201cRecognition of Indigenous Peoples\u2019 rights in the context of the climate crisis, biodiversity governance and territorial integrity: focusing on nomadic and semi-nomadic peoples, including pastoralists and shifting cultivators\u201d The Economic and Social Council decides to authorize a three-day international expert group meeting on the theme \u201cRecognition of Indigenous Peoples\u2019 rights in the context of the climate crisis, biodiversity governance and territorial integrity: focusing on nomadic and semi-nomadic peoples, including pastoralists and shifting cultivators\u201d. Draft decision II Venue and dates of the twenty-fifth session of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues The Economic and Social Council decides that the twenty-fifth session of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues shall be held at United Nations Headquarters from 20 April to 1 May 2026.

Discussion on the theme \u201cImplementing the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples within United Nations Member States and the United Nations system, including identifying good practices and addressing challenges\u201d (item 3) 4. Gradual progress, characterized by advancements and ongoing challenges, has been made on the implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Many States have integrated the principles contained in the Declaration into their legal frameworks, promoting self-determination, land rights and cultural heritage protection. These efforts reflect a growing commitment to aligning domestic policies with international standards on Indigenous Peoples\u2019 rights. United Nations initiatives, such as the system-wide action plan for ensuring a coherent approach to achieving the ends of the Declaration and the call to action of the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination set out in \u201cBuilding an inclusive, sustainable and resilient future with Indigenous Peoples: a call to action\u201d, have further advanced the integration of the Declaration into institutional practices, fostering greater coherence and accountability. 5. However, significant barriers persist. Indigenous Peoples often face systemic discrimination, exclusion from decision-making and threats to their lands and territories due to, inter alia, development without free, prior and informed consent, extractive industries, armed conflict and climate change. Free, prior and informed consent is a cornerstone of the Declaration and is frequently disregarded, exacerbating conflict and marginalization. Political will remains uneven, leading to inconsistent implementation and enforcement of the rights of Indigenous Peoples. 6. Addressing these challenges requires stronger political commitment, capacity- building and genuine partnerships with Indigenous Peoples. Enhancing legal protections, ensuring access to justice and incorporating Indigenous knowledge into environmental and development strategies are critical. Good practices, such as participatory governance, culturally appropriate education and inclusive policymaking, offer replicable solutions. Continued advocacy, monitoring and international collaboration are vital to closing the gap between aspiration and reality. 7. The Permanent Forum welcomes the study entitled \u201cEvaluating institutional structures to improve the health and wellness of Indigenous Peoples globally: the Indigenous determinants of health measurement instrument\u201d (E/C.19/2025/5) and recommends that Member States and United Nations entities adopt the instrument with a view to prioritizing cultural safety, upholding the principles of the Declaration and accurately measuring the Indigenous determinants of health. 8. \u2060The Permanent Forum urges all Member States that have not formally recognized Indigenous Peoples within their territories to do so, in law and practice, under the term \u201cIndigenous Peoples\u201d. Recognition must go beyond symbolic acknowledgement and encompass concrete measures to uphold their individual and collective rights in accordance with the Declaration. 9. The Permanent Forum emphasizes the urgent need to fully implement the Declaration across the United Nations. Key recommendations include adopting the Indigenous determinants of health evaluation instrument, increasing Indigenous Peoples\u2019 participation in decision-making and eliminating structural barriers, violence and discrimination, in particular against Indigenous two-spirit peoples. All United Nations reports, mechanisms and processes must fully reflect the experiences and rights of Indigenous two-spirit peoples. Furthermore, the Forum calls for Indigenous E/2025/43 E/C.19/2025/8 6/23 25-07572 Peoples\u2019 rights and self-determination to be recognized in and integrated into national legislation, policies and governance. 10. Member States should acknowledge the critical role of Indigenous Peoples as guardians of their lands and territories; their traditional knowledge must be fully respected in environmental governance, including the protection and use of medicinal plants, such as the coca leaf and peyote, that hold profound religious, cultural and spiritual significance to Indigenous Peoples, and their ecosystems. Recommendations for Member States 11.

Recommendations for Member States 11. The Permanent Forum calls upon the United States of America and all Member States to uphold their commitments to ensuring the full and effective participation of Indigenous Peoples who require a visa to attend the sessions of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues and other relevant meetings, in line with the joint letter of April 2025 from the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the Special Rapporteur on the rights of Indigenous Peoples. In their letter, they highlight the urgent need to facilitate the timely issuance of visas and unimpeded access to venues, with a view to ensuring the meaningful inclusion of Indigenous Peoples in decision-making, as enshrined in articles 18 and 42 of the Declaration, supported by the Charter of the United Nations and other relevant international human rights instruments. 12. The Permanent Forum reiterates its call for Canada and the United States to decommission the Enbridge Line 5 oil pipeline, which poses a real and credible threat to the Great Lakes and Indigenous Peoples. Both States must implement the Declaration in connection with Line 5 by respecting the free, prior and informed consent of the affected Indigenous Peoples. 13. The Permanent Forum calls upon India to uphold human rights in conflict- affected Manipur. While noting positive developments, the Forum recommends that India take effective measures to restore peace and normalcy, including by addressing decades of displacement and trauma, and to bring perpetrators of human rights violations to justice. The Forum calls for an immediate cessation of violence and insists that the State adopt peaceful measures to end the conflict. 14. Member States are encouraged to reaffirm their commitment to prevent the use of Indigenous Peoples\u2019 resources, lands and territories without free, prior and informed consent and respect the territorial integrity of Indigenous Peoples. The population of Greenland is over 90 per cent Indigenous; hence, the Declaration applies fully, along with national and international law. Member States are called to honour the territorial integrity and political autonomy of Greenland. 15. The Permanent Forum urges the United States to fully implement the Declaration by strengthening commitments to Indigenous leadership, including by seating the delegate of the Cherokee Nation in the House of Representatives. It welcomes the adoption of the Declaration by the Pawnee, Ho-Chunk, Yurok and Muscogee (Creek) Nations. 16. The Permanent Forum urges the Government of the Plurinational State of Bolivia to comply with the articles of the Declaration that have been incorporated into its Constitution, including those on free, prior and informed consent, protecting Indigenous women and ensuring territorial integrity. Recommendations for the United Nations system 17. The Permanent Forum welcomes the continued commitment and role of the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Indigenous Peoples in enhancing the participation of Indigenous Peoples within the United Nations system. The Forum notes the E/2025/43 E/C.19/2025/8 25-07572 7/23 financial difficulties faced by the Fund and encourages Member States and funders to support the Voluntary Fund and the trust fund on Indigenous issues. 18. The Permanent Forum commends the progress made at the intersessional meetings of the Human Rights Council, noting that, at the second intersessional meeting of the Human Rights Council on concrete ways to enhance the participation of Indigenous Peoples in the work of the Council, for the first time, Indigenous Peoples from all seven sociocultural regions participated directly. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is invited to share lessons from that process with other United Nations entities. The Forum recommends that the Council, at its fifty-ninth session, establish a separate accreditation status for the representatives and institutions of Indigenous Peoples. The principles of the Declaration should inform the accreditation procedure, with due regard for self- determination, self-identification, equality, non-discrimination and accountability. 19.

The Permanent Forum welcomes General Assembly resolution 78/328 on enhanced participation and recommends that the Assembly and the Human Rights Council ensure the full and effective involvement of Indigenous Peoples and their representative institutions. It calls upon Member States to financially support the Indigenous Coordinating Body for Enhanced Participation in the United Nations. 20. The Permanent Forum welcomes the establishment of the Subsidiary Body on Article 8 (j) and Other Provisions of the Convention on Biological Diversity Related to Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities (decision 16/5) and the adoption of the new programme of work related thereto (decision 16/4) at the sixteenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity. It urges the operationalization of the decision on the continued prioritization of Indigenous Peoples\u2019 traditional knowledge in implementing the Convention and the Kunming- Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. The Forum also acknowledges that the Global Plan of Action on Biodiversity and Health (decision 16/19) draws on the study on the Indigenous determinants of health in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (E/C.19/2023/5). 21. Noting the ongoing negotiations in the Intergovernmental Committee on Intellectual Property and Genetic Resources, Traditional Knowledge and Folklore of the World Intellectual Property Organization, the Permanent Forum urges States to ensure adequate funding for the participation of Indigenous Peoples and to reach an agreement without delay. Discussion on the six mandated areas of the Permanent Forum (economic and social development, culture, environment, education, health and human rights), with reference to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (item 4) 22. The Permanent Forum reviewed its six mandated areas (economic and social development, culture, environment, education, health and human rights) through the lens of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Speakers highlighted the gap between global pledges and realities, citing land loss, cultural erosion, health inequities and barriers to education and livelihoods. The Forum stresses that full implementation of the Declaration, integrated with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, is vital to justice, equity and sustainability for Indigenous Peoples. 23. The Permanent Forum welcomes the study entitled \u201cImpact of colonization and armed conflicts on Indigenous Peoples\u2019 rights: the imperative of peacebuilding\u201d (E/C.19/2025/7) and underscores its relevance to Indigenous Peoples worldwide due to continued oppression, displacement, loss of life and intergenerational trauma resulting from armed conflicts and colonialism. E/2025/43 E/C.19/2025/8 8/23 25-07572 24. The Permanent Forum endorses the report of the international expert group meeting on the theme \u201cThe rights of Indigenous Peoples, including those in voluntary isolation and initial contact in the context of critical minerals\u201d (E/C.19/2025/4). The Forum urges the United Nations system, the private sector and multinational corporations to collaborate on the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report. Addressing the rights of Indigenous Peoples in voluntary isolation and initial contact is vital and States must take urgent action to comply with these recommendations. Recommendations for the United Nations system 25. States should operationalize the Declaration by reviewing and reforming internal administrative boundaries that divide Indigenous Peoples\u2019 territories, ensuring respect for their territorial integrity. United Nations entities should integrate Indigenous Peoples\u2019 territorial realities into data systems, peacebuilding, development and humanitarian efforts to avoid reliance on State-centric boundaries that overlook Indigenous geographies. 26. The Permanent Forum urges United Nations entities, States and partners to fund and support effective youth participation in all relevant United Nations forums. Sufficient financing will better enable Indigenous youth to shape a sustainable future. 27.",

The Permanent Forum urges United Nations entities, States and partners to fund and support effective youth participation in all relevant United Nations forums. Sufficient financing will better enable Indigenous youth to shape a sustainable future. 27. United Nations Ocean Conferences should ensure the effective engagement of Indigenous Peoples, as exemplified in decision 16/19 adopted by the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity in 2024, in which the Indigenous determinants of health framework was incorporated. 28. The Coalition on Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Food Systems is critical for Indigenous- led food sovereignty. The Permanent Forum calls upon States and United Nations entities to provide funding for the Coalition. 29. The Permanent Forum commends the World Health Organization (WHO), including its regional offices, for advancing the recognition of Indigenous Peoples\u2019 traditional medicine and midwifery. However, some regional offices, particularly the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), utilize the concept of interculturality, which predates the Declaration, to conflate rights holders with stakeholders in the implementation of initiatives, undermining Indigenous Peoples\u2019 autonomy and self- determination and compliance with the principle of free, prior and informed consent. The Forum calls upon PAHO and any regional offices using this approach to halt this conflation and to address Indigenous issues separately from those of stakeholders. WHO, PAHO and Member States should also recognize Indigenous midwifery as an autonomous ancestral practice and a critical Indigenous determinant of health, decriminalize Indigenous-recognized traditional midwifery, finance Indigenous-led maternal care, integrate Indigenous-recognized midwifery into national health policies, and fully respect Indigenous Peoples\u2019 distinct rights. 30. The Permanent Forum calls upon the World Tourism Organization, the World Bank and the World Health Organization to develop a framework for monitoring and reporting on the impact of tourism on Indigenous Peoples by 2026, including data disaggregation. Recommendations for Member States 31. The Permanent Forum urges States that have not yet done so to ratify Convention No. 169 of the International Labour Organization and to take concrete measures to fully implement the Declaration. E/2025/43 E/C.19/2025/8 25-07572 9/23 32. The Permanent Forum commends Ecuador for its openness in engaging with the Forum. The Forum encourages Ecuador to implement the rulings of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights of 2012 regarding the Kichwa people of Sarayaku and of 2025 regarding the Tagaeri and Taromenane peoples living in voluntary isolation. The Forum is concerned by the need to urgently clear territories affected by explosive ordnance. The Forum is also concerned by reports of criminalization of Indigenous leaders in Ecuador. The Forum invites Ecuador to report on the progress made in relation to the implementation of these rulings and other positive developments at its twenty-fifth session. The Forum also urges Ecuador to adopt the draft national law on free, prior and informed consent, currently under debate in the National Assembly, and developed with the effective participation of Indigenous Peoples. 33. Nicaragua must respect the rights of Indigenous Peoples in the Moskitia region (La Mosquitia) and cease militarization and criminalization with respect to their lands and territories. In line with the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, Nicaragua should immediately release arbitrarily detained Indigenous leaders and defenders and take measures to clarify the fate and whereabouts of those subjected to enforced disappearance. 34. Iraq should secure self-identified Indigenous Peoples\u2019 rights to their lands, territories, cultures and self-governance, guaranteeing free, prior and informed consent and respecting their right to self-identification. 35. The Permanent Forum commends Peru for its contributions to the international recognition of Indigenous Peoples\u2019 rights, including in the development and adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. However, the Forum is concerned about recent legislation in Peru, namely Law No. 32301 amending the law on the Peruvian Agency for International Cooperation. The Forum has been informed by Indigenous Peoples that this new amendment risks criminalizing Indigenous human rights defenders for their advocacy and risks granting immunity for serious human rights violations.",

The Forum has been informed by Indigenous Peoples that this new amendment risks criminalizing Indigenous human rights defenders for their advocacy and risks granting immunity for serious human rights violations. The Forum recommends that Peru review its legislation and ensure that implementation thereof aligns with its human rights obligations, including freedom of expression and association, which are particularly vital for Indigenous Peoples to enjoy their rights under the Declaration. The Forum encourages Peru to protect Indigenous human rights defenders and to engage in meaningful, transparent consultations with representatives of Indigenous Peoples and their institutions when enacting any legislation affecting their rights and adopting regulations to implement those laws. Peru should implement laws to avoid legislation being used to foster impunity for crimes against humanity committed against Indigenous human rights defenders. 36. The Permanent Forum noted the draft federal law on the languages of the peoples of the Russian Federation and calls upon the Russian Federation to take Indigenous Peoples\u2019 language rights into consideration. Dialogue with the United Nations agencies, funds and programmes (item 5 (c)) 37. The Permanent Forum heard from United Nations entities about their activities to implement the system-wide action plan for ensuring a coherent approach to achieving the ends of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and progress on implementing the Forum\u2019s recommendations. United Nations entities also shared concerns about the impact of significant budget cuts and pushback on upholding the rights of Indigenous Peoples and the invisibility of Indigenous Peoples in data. E/2025/43 E/C.19/2025/8 10/23 25-07572 38. The Inter-Agency Support Group on Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Issues outlined an accountability framework involving United Nations resident coordinators to assess successes and challenges in implementing the Declaration. The Permanent Forum welcomes this initiative and urges the United Nations to ensure that this process is implemented, including in Member States that withhold recognition of Indigenous Peoples. 39. United Nations entities recommended that Indigenous Peoples strengthen advocacy and engagement at the national level, including with parliamentarians, financial mechanisms, plans and programmes. The Permanent Forum acknowledges the opportunity to engage on and promote Indigenous Peoples\u2019 rights in the Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture and the Committee on World Food Security of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in discussions on ultraprocessed food and the International Code of Conduct on the Distribution and Use of Pesticides. 40. United Nations entities are urged to strengthen and facilitate Indigenous women\u2019s and young people\u2019s engagement in decision-making across the United Nations, enhancing capacity-building, knowledge exchange, and advisory roles. 41. Many United Nations treaty negotiations \u2013 such as the WHO Pandemic Agreement \u2013 lacked Indigenous Peoples\u2019 meaningful participation. The Permanent Forum urges States to strengthen Indigenous Peoples\u2019 effective engagement when deciding on participation modalities in ongoing and future United Nations treaty negotiations. 42. The Permanent Forum expresses concern over the current implementation of the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, where reliance on State and non-State intermediaries and on efforts designed by States continues to marginalize Indigenous Peoples whose lands and territories are central to restoration efforts. The Forum calls upon the United Nations Environment Programme to fulfil the Decade\u2019s transformative promise by ensuring the recognition of Indigenous Peoples as rights holders and ecological stewards, ensuring direct access to finance and embedding their leadership in the next five-year strategic plans in the mechanisms supporting Indigenous-led restoration. 43. United Nations entities should ensure the inclusion, equality and equity of Indigenous Peoples in humanitarian responses. 44. The Permanent Forum urges WHO to establish a standing Indigenous-led advisory committee to the Director General regarding Indigenous Peoples\u2019 health to steer, monitor and report annually on the implementation and ongoing operationalization of World Health Assembly resolution 76.16.",

The committee should be majority-Indigenous, gender-balanced, regionally diverse, and chosen through Indigenous representative institutions, in line with free, prior and informed consent. Human rights dialogue with the Special Rapporteur on the rights of Indigenous Peoples and the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples; annual review of progress on the implementation of general recommendation No. 39 (2022) (item 5 (d)) 45. The dialogue with the Special Rapporteur on the rights of Indigenous Peoples and the Chair of the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples highlighted recent developments and challenges related to Indigenous Peoples\u2019 rights. The Permanent Forum welcomes the two mechanisms\u2019 thematic focus on the right of Indigenous Peoples to determine their identity, the need for a clear distinction between Indigenous Peoples and local communities, the criminalization of Indigenous Peoples E/2025/43 E/C.19/2025/8 25-07572 11/23 and the encroachment upon their territories by criminal gangs and extractive industries. 46. Collaboration between the Indigenous Peoples\u2019 mechanisms, the United Nations treaty bodies and the Human Rights Council special procedures can be mutually reinforcing to advance the recognition and protection of Indigenous Peoples\u2019 rights. Such engagements should be not mere procedural exercises (so-called \u201crights ritualism\u201d) but aimed at concrete outcomes. 47. The Permanent Forum looks forward to the finalization of the study of the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples on \u201cIndigenous People\u2019s right to data, including data collection and disaggregation\u201d. In addition, the Forum is concerned that the underfunding of the United Nations human rights system seriously limits the Special Rapporteur on the rights of Indigenous Peoples and the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in discharging their mandates. 48. The Permanent Forum welcomes the preparation of the forthcoming study on Indigenous justice systems by the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers and invites her to present it to the Forum at its twenty-fifth session. Recommendations for Member States 49. The Permanent Forum commends the progress of numerous States in recognizing Indigenous Peoples and their rights in constitutional reforms to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, including on free, prior and informed consent legislation. Several countries spoke with pride of their policies of non-discrimination and equal access to public services. Still, some countries stopped short of engaging in meaningful discussions on the right to self-identification. The Forum recommends that States initiate dialogues on identity and non-discrimination with Indigenous Peoples concerned. 50. Truth-telling is a prerequisite for reconciliation; it helps to build new constructive arrangements and treaties between Indigenous Peoples and States. States and Indigenous Peoples are invited to initiate and support studies to document internal colonialism cases predating, coinciding with and surviving external colonialism. Those studies can offer policy guidance for dismantling such structures and restoring Indigenous Peoples\u2019 self-governance. States and Indigenous Peoples are encouraged to contribute to debates on ways in which the United Nations system can redress and mediate the situations of internal colonialism at future sessions of the Permanent Forum. 51. The lack of disaggregated data hides the realities confronting Indigenous Peoples and prohibits efforts to redress the inequalities and discrimination suffered and devise effective targeted measures. This problem can be exacerbated when Indigenous Peoples are not recognized. States should develop and operationalize comprehensive, rights-based disaggregated data frameworks in collaboration with Indigenous Peoples. 52. Several speakers emphasized the role of Indigenous women in peacebuilding. States are called upon to ensure Indigenous women\u2019s participation in peace negotiations and peacebuilding.",

Several speakers emphasized the role of Indigenous women in peacebuilding. States are called upon to ensure Indigenous women\u2019s participation in peace negotiations and peacebuilding. Although adversely affected by armed conflict and violence, the role of Indigenous Peoples in conflict resolution and peacebuilding is largely ignored. States are encouraged to ensure the inclusion and participation of Indigenous Peoples in ongoing peacemaking processes and to fulfil the agreements achieved with the participation of Indigenous Peoples. The Permanent Forum reiterates previous calls upon Bangladesh to ensure effective progress on implementing the Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord of 1997. E/2025/43 E/C.19/2025/8 12/23 25-07572 53. The Permanent Forum heard testimonies on the many barriers in access to justice for Indigenous Peoples. It is deeply concerned about the disproportionate incarceration rates of Indigenous Peoples, especially children. States are urged to implement the internationally recommended age of criminal responsibility of at least 14 years. States must uphold the Convention on the Rights of the Child, under which incarceration must be a measure of last resort. The Forum condemns States\u2019 violations of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. The Forum calls upon States to remove existing barriers, ensure culturally appropriate access to justice and prevent the overcriminalization of Indigenous Peoples. 54. The Permanent Forum takes note of the efforts of Chile to promote the rights of Indigenous Peoples through the Presidential Commission for Peace and Understanding. The Forum invites Chile to implement general recommendation No. 39 (2022) by adopting the necessary legislation and public policies. It also urges Chile to replicate these positive developments with other Indigenous Peoples in its territory and to present progress to the Forum at its twenty-fifth session. 55. The Permanent Forum calls upon Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan and the Sudan to promptly end violence against Indigenous Peoples, particularly Indigenous women and children, in the context of armed conflict, counter-terrorism and mining activities. Any peace process must involve Indigenous Peoples, in line with General Assembly resolution 79/159. 56. The Permanent Forum heard about the retreat of New Zealand/Aotearoa from honouring Te Tiriti o Waitangi (The Treaty of Waitangi), which sparked the country\u2019s largest-ever protest. The Forum calls upon New Zealand to recommit to the Treaty. 57. The disproportionate impact of Russian aggression against Ukraine on Indigenous Peoples in the region includes conscription, mass displacement and attacks on identity, violating their individual and collective rights. In occupied Crimea, Indigenous women are persecuted and detained for defending human rights. The Permanent Forum calls upon the Russian Federation to engage in constructive negotiations to achieve just and durable peace. 58. Following the recent coup in Myanmar, political instability persists, with planned military-led elections widely seen as a means to entrench power rather than restore democracy. Ongoing air strikes, even amid a 7.7 magnitude earthquake, highlight the crisis. The Human Rights Council and relevant mechanisms are urged to strengthen protection measures and establish more robust, locally grounded human rights monitoring for Indigenous Peoples facing violence and displacement. Interregional, intergenerational and global dialogue (item 5 (e)) 59. The Permanent Forum held an interregional, intergenerational and global dialogue on the theme \u201cThe rights of Indigenous women\u201d. The Forum extends its appreciation to the Minister of Environment and Sustainable Development of Colombia, Lena Estrada A\u00f1okazi, for her participation during the twenty-fourth session. 60. The systemic challenges that Indigenous women and girls experience include gender-based violence, marginalization, discrimination and violations of their sexual and reproductive health rights. Indigenous women who advocate for their individual and collective rights also face retaliation. The Permanent Forum heard testimonies asserting that Indigenous women had been imprisoned for organizing peaceful events, even on International Women\u2019s Day. 61. Indigenous women continue to face intersectional forms of discrimination and systemic racism.",

The Permanent Forum heard testimonies asserting that Indigenous women had been imprisoned for organizing peaceful events, even on International Women\u2019s Day. 61. Indigenous women continue to face intersectional forms of discrimination and systemic racism. The Permanent Forum urges States to promote the leadership of E/2025/43 E/C.19/2025/8 25-07572 13/23 Indigenous women in order to address contemporary intersectional discrimination and intergenerational and historical trauma, including for those living outside their ancestral homelands. 62. Despite facing immense adversity, Indigenous women continue to be resilient advocates. They call upon Member States to uphold their international commitments to gender equality and to prioritize the inclusion of Indigenous women in decision- making on development policies and programmes. Global Indigenous women\u2019s rights movement 63. Thirty years ago, Indigenous women delegates at the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing made a historic promise: never again would Indigenous women return to advocate at the United Nations alone. 64. The unity of Indigenous women is exemplified through three decades of the Continental Network of Indigenous Women of the Americas \u2013 a coalition of 26 national Indigenous women\u2019s organizations across 23 countries \u2013 and 25 years of the International Indigenous Women\u2019s Forum. These organizations have played a crucial role in establishing and transforming international platforms, including the Permanent Forum, the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the Special Rapporteur on the rights of Indigenous Peoples. 65. Indigenous women have played an invaluable role in shaping global standards, notably through the adoption by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women of its general recommendation No. 39 (2022) on the rights of Indigenous women and girls. The Permanent Forum had called upon the Commission on the Status of Women to prioritize gender equality and the empowerment of Indigenous women and girls as an emerging theme within its multi-year programme of work. 66. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women must guarantee equal access and non-discrimination of Indigenous women in respect of its communications procedure under the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. States are encouraged to report annually on their progress in implementing general recommendation No. 39. 67. The Permanent Forum urges the representatives and institutions of Indigenous Peoples to submit candidates, especially Indigenous women, for the Working Group on Business and Human Rights of the Human Rights Council. It also encourages the Forum on Business and Human Rights to establish an ad hoc committee for Indigenous Peoples during the nineteenth cycle of the Human Rights Council. The Permanent Forum invites relevant mechanisms of the Human Rights Council to devote attention in their reports to the situation of Indigenous women and children. 68. States must ensure equitable and direct access to funding for Indigenous women\u2019s organizations, with a view to enhancing their participation and leadership in decision-making processes. 69. The Permanent Forum acknowledges the commitment by Australia to develop a national action plan to address violence against Indigenous women and children \u2013 a milestone championed by Indigenous women. The Forum urges Australia to meet that commitment and provide sufficient resources to implement the plan and calls upon other States to adopt similar strategies. Indigenous children and the health of Indigenous women 70. Reports of Indigenous children being forcibly removed from their mothers by State agencies evoke painful parallels with discriminatory assimilationist laws of the E/2025/43 E/C.19/2025/8 14/23 25-07572 past. The high rates of child removal by welfare systems are alarming and are often justified through processes that fail to account for the unique cultural contexts of Indigenous Peoples. 71. Forced sterilizations and coerced contraception campaigns are serious violations of reproductive health rights, disproportionately targeting Indigenous women and adolescents worldwide. These practices often stem from systemic racism, colonial ideologies and attempts to control population growth. States must adopt a human rights-based approach to investigate and address these practices.",

These practices often stem from systemic racism, colonial ideologies and attempts to control population growth. States must adopt a human rights-based approach to investigate and address these practices. In addition, the Human Rights Council, at its fifty-ninth session, is urged to establish a commission of inquiry \u2013 grounded in free, prior and informed consent and Indigenous-run health systems \u2013 to document the global impact of such practices. 72. Recognizing the dangers of mercury and other harmful contaminants in the context of extractive industries, the Permanent Forum urges States to implement comprehensive monitoring and regulation of toxic contaminants on the lands and territories of Indigenous Peoples, including the restoration of sites and water resources that have been affected. It highlights the urgent need to address the severe impact on the health of Indigenous women and children, including neurological damage from prenatal or dietary exposure, and calls for effective interventions and remediation from health and environmental impacts. Armed conflict and military occupation 73. Indigenous women and children are disproportionately affected by military occupation and armed conflict, which result in, among other things, forced displacement, gender-based violence, trafficking in persons, sexual violence, forced marriage and abduction. These actions are prohibited under international humanitarian and human rights law, including the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The Permanent Forum calls for the United Nations system, the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice and the humanitarian aid sector to ensure that targeted assistance is offered to Indigenous Peoples. The Forum also urges Member States to end impunity and prosecute perpetrators. Dialogue on Indigenous platforms established within United Nations entities (item 5 (f)) 74. There has been growing recognition of the need for formal United Nations mechanisms that ensure Indigenous Peoples\u2019 meaningful participation in global governance. These platforms must respect Indigenous Peoples\u2019 rights, governance, and decision-making bodies, systems and institutions. The Permanent Forum will continue to advise States, Indigenous Peoples and United Nations entities to strengthen Indigenous Peoples\u2019 roles in multilateral processes. 75. The Permanent Forum heard from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change secretariat to the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform; the secretariat of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa regarding the Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Caucus; the secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity regarding the newly established permanent subsidiary body on article 8 (j); the International Fund for Agricultural Development secretariat regarding the Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Forum; and the Coalition on Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Food Systems hosted by the World Food Programme. 76. The Permanent Forum strongly encourages United Nations entities to engage directly with Indigenous Peoples where applicable, including at the national and local E/2025/43 E/C.19/2025/8 25-07572 15/23 levels, even in countries where Indigenous Peoples are not officially recognized. This approach aligns with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the right to self-identification and can ensure that programmes are inclusive, culturally appropriate and responsive to Indigenous Peoples\u2019 needs. 77. The Permanent Forum urges all United Nations entities to institutionalize engagement with Indigenous Peoples in high-level events. The Forum also encourages the Conferences of the Parties to the Rio conventions to invite the Forum to participate in negotiations in its capacity as an advisory body within the United Nations system. 78. The Permanent Forum urges Member States, and the Convention on Biological Diversity secretariat\u2019s permanent subsidiary body on article 8 (j), in its new work programme, to include Indigenous Peoples\u2019 leadership at all levels, including as Co- Chairs, working group leads, expert groups and Bureau members from the seven sociocultural regions.",

The Forum reiterates its call upon United Nations entities and the Parties to biodiversity and climate agreements to recognize the distinct identities and specific rights of Indigenous Peoples. The Forum encourages the use of accurate and differentiated terminology and recommends avoiding the combined or interchangeable use of the terms \u201cIndigenous Peoples\u201d and \u201clocal communities\u201d as a single category. 79. The Permanent Forum calls upon Mongolia, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the Convention to Combat Desertification secretariat to ensure the meaningful participation of representatives of Indigenous pastoralists in the International Year of Rangelands and Pastoralism (General Assembly resolution 76/253) and in all related events and processes. Adequate and sustained funding must be secured for Indigenous Peoples\u2019 participation. 80. The Permanent Forum takes note with appreciation of the Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge of the World Intellectual Property Organization for the benefit of Indigenous Peoples. It urges Member States to sign, ratify and implement the Treaty, which contains measures to protect against biopiracy, includes Indigenous Peoples\u2019 full and effective participation in the Assembly of the Contracting Parties to the Treaty and acknowledges States\u2019 commitments to achieving the ends of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Thematic dialogue on the financing of Indigenous Peoples\u2019 work and participation across the multilateral and regional system (item 5 (g)) 81. The extraction of critical minerals, which is essential for the global transition to renewable energy, has far-reaching implications for Indigenous Peoples, whose lands and territories are often rich in these vital resources. While crucial to addressing climate change, unregulated or exploitative extraction risks repeating historical injustices and endangering Indigenous Peoples\u2019 rights, ecosystems and ways of life. Indigenous Peoples must be recognized as rights holders and essential partners in building a just and sustainable future, and not as barriers to development. 82. Indigenous Peoples continue to face systemic obstacles to accessing financial resources that would enable them to participate fully in policy processes. Funding often bypasses Indigenous Peoples, undermining their governance and self- determination. Financial institutions and global actors must establish equitable, direct and accessible funding mechanisms aligned with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Indigenous leadership and participation are critical to advancing climate action, biodiversity protection and inclusive sustainable development. E/2025/43 E/C.19/2025/8 16/23 25-07572 Critical minerals 83. Existing mining standards and initiatives must never substitute for legal obligations that ensure social and environmental safeguards. Extractive industries should be required to restore mining sites. 84. States should align legal frameworks with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the Indigenous Peoples Principles and Protocols for Just Transition 2 and the recommendations of the United Nations Secretary-General\u2019s Panel on Critical Energy Transition Minerals regarding extractive activities, environmental protection, human rights and Indigenous Peoples\u2019 collective and individual rights. 85. States, mining companies and financial institutions must uphold the right of Indigenous Peoples to free, prior and informed consent, including the option to reject proposed projects that would affect their lands and territories. The representation and participation of Indigenous Peoples must be gender-balanced; and their self- determination and self-governance structures must be respected. Special protection must be afforded to Indigenous Peoples in voluntary isolation and initial contact, in accordance with the Declaration and existing human rights standards, including respect for precautionary and no-contact principles. 86.

States, mining companies and financial institutions should ensure the establishment of accessible, independent and culturally appropriate grievance and redress mechanisms for Indigenous Peoples that should be available throughout the life cycle of the projects. These sectors should support sustainable development, track the origin and impacts of minerals throughout the supply chain and disclose human rights risks and environmental impacts. 87. States are urged to take necessary measures where appropriate to ensure the rights, protection and safety of Indigenous leaders and human rights defenders and to promote a safe and enabling environment in which human rights violations, killings, reprisals and abuses against or related to them are prevented and investigated, the perpetrators are held accountable and access to justice and remedy are ensured, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 79/159. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and States should ensure the meaningful inclusion of Indigenous Peoples when developing strategies to prevent and combat environmental and other crimes. This includes supporting capacity-building for the documentation and reporting of alleged crimes, Indigenous-led monitoring, and accountability and reparations for environmental harm on Indigenous lands and territories. Indigenous Peoples are encouraged to participate in and contribute to the Commission on Narcotic Drugs and the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice. 88. States should establish a buffer zone around Indigenous Peoples\u2019 lands and territories to protect their rights and resources from the impacts of extractive activities, including those involving critical minerals. This will protect the lives and ecosystems of Indigenous Peoples and is vital for biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation. 89. States must immediately halt mining projects in Argentina, Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Brazil, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Russian Federation and Sweden and other projects violating the right of Indigenous Peoples to free, prior and informed consent. Furthermore, States should align their legislation with the Declaration, ensuring that companies are liable for human rights violations committed overseas. __________________ 2 Available at www.indigenoussummit.org/summit-outcome. E/2025/43 E/C.19/2025/8 25-07572 17/23 90. It is recommended that the secretariat of the Minamata Convention on Mercury conduct a comprehensive assessment of mercury emissions and releases, in particular from gold mining and processing activities that use mercury. The report on the assessment should contain a specific examination of the effects of such emissions on ecosystems, livelihoods, culture and the health of Indigenous Peoples. 91. The intergovernmental negotiating committee to develop an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution, including in the marine environment, should guarantee the meaningful participation of Indigenous Peoples in all negotiations; their rights under the Declaration should be respected, and their knowledge systems incorporated into the instrument. Financing 92. To address global challenges, Indigenous Peoples must be urgently included in financial architecture reform. Multilateral development banks should develop policies that ensure direct access to financing for Indigenous Peoples, in particular for Indigenous women and young people. 93. All Parties and stakeholders to the Rio conventions should implement the principles and guidelines for direct access funding for Indigenous Peoples\u2019 climate action, biodiversity conservation and fighting desertification for a sustainable planet.3 The vision of the initiative that led to the drafting of the principles and guidelines is to establish a permanent, independent, Indigenous-led global fund to support coordination, knowledge-sharing and advocacy globally, advancing biodiversity conservation, climate action and the protection of life. 94. The Green Climate Fund, the Cali Fund for the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits from the Use of Digital Sequence Information on Genetic Resources, the Tropical Forest Forever Facility and the Adaptation Fund should ensure direct access to finance in support of Indigenous-led mitigation and adaptation projects and ensure the representation and participation of Indigenous Peoples in",

Indigenous Peoples are encouraged to participate in the Fourth International Conference on Financing for Development. States should explicitly reference issues of relevance to Indigenous Peoples, including direct access to financing and partnership with Indigenous Peoples, in the outcome document of the Conference. Future work of the Permanent Forum, including issues considered by the Economic and Social Council, the outcome document of the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples and emerging issues (item 6) 96. The Permanent Forum welcomes the request for the President of the General Assembly, through Assembly resolution 79/159, to convene a high-level panel to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in 2027. The meeting should be entitled \u201cSecond World Conference on Indigenous Peoples\u201d and should serve to review the implementation of the outcome document of the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples of 2014 and recent developments pertaining to the rights of Indigenous Peoples. The enhanced participation of Indigenous Peoples in the event must be ensured. The Forum urges United Nations entities, financial partners and others to support Indigenous Peoples in organizing the preparatory meetings for the high-level event. 97. The Permanent Forum reiterates the recommendations of its eighteenth session and urges the Secretary-General to appoint a special envoy or special adviser, in consultation with Indigenous Peoples, to raise awareness of and promote the rights of __________________ 3 Available at https://bit.ly/3Gz5PCu. E/2025/43 E/C.19/2025/8 18/23 25-07572 Indigenous Peoples and to provide support in the follow-up to the outcome document of the World Conference. 98. The Permanent Forum notes that Indigenous Peoples have long struggled to have their voices heard at the United Nations in New York, Geneva and other venues. The Secretary General\u2019s UN80 Initiative, under which all United Nations activities and the current liquidity crisis are being reviewed, should not result in the diminished participation of Indigenous Peoples\u2019 representatives at the United Nations; rather, it should serve as an opportunity to enhance the full and effective participation of Indigenous Peoples, including by finalizing the processes outlined in General Assembly resolution 71/321. 99. The Permanent Forum supports the convening of a fourth seminar on treaties, agreements and other constructive arrangements between States and Indigenous Peoples, to be organized in conjunction with the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. 100. The Permanent Forum welcomes the inclusion of Indigenous Peoples in General Assembly resolution 78/327 and requests that States ensure their effective and meaningful participation throughout the preparatory processes leading up to the United Nations Water Conferences of 2026 and 2028. This includes facilitating the registration of Indigenous Peoples\u2019 organizations and representatives, promoting full engagement in all process stages and adopting an approach aligned with the Declaration. 101. The Permanent Forum urges the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, ahead of its World Conservation Congress of 2025, to reaffirm Indigenous Peoples\u2019 inherent rights to their lands and territories in accordance with the Declaration, including where these overlap with protected areas. The Forum rejects conservation models that undermine Indigenous Peoples\u2019 governance and customary law. 102. The Permanent Forum recognizes the practical difficulties of organizing its sessions in New York due to barriers to participation faced by Indigenous Peoples. In line with Economic and Social Council resolution 2000/22, it will consider alternate venues. 103. The Permanent Forum requests that Member States donate to the trust fund on Indigenous issues, which is managed by the Department of Economic and Social Affairs. The fund provides crucial support to the Forum and its follow-up on recommendations to fully implement the Declaration. 104.",

      "text": "it and investigations activities in 2024 (DP/OPS/2025/4), with the UNOPS Deputy Executive Director (Delivery and Partnerships) providing the management response. 7. The Chairs of the UNDP Audit and Evaluation Advisory Committee (AEAC), the UNFPA Oversight Advisory Committee (OAC) and the UNOPS Audit Advisory Committee (AAC) presented their respective annual reports for 2024. Management from the respective entities referred to these reports in their statements. 8. An Executive Board Bureau member welcomed the independence and essential role of oversight offices, emphasizing their value as a critical check on the system. They expressed appreciation for the informal briefings and raised three questions: (a) whether increased reporting indicates greater trust in the system; (b) clarification on the evolution of the investigation model of UNDP; and (c) whether the findings at UNFPA, though not affecting delivery, might impact credibility. They also encouraged continued discussion on protection from sexual exploitation and abuse (PSEA) during future deliberations. 9. Another Bureau member acknowledged the satisfactory ratings of UNDP and UNFPA and noted the partially satisfactory rating of UNOPS. They posed a broader question to the Board: should a \"satisfactory\" rating be considered the ceiling for oversight performance, or should entities strive for higher standards as systems mature? DP/2025/20 4 25-11430 10. A delegation underscored the critical role of OAI, OAIS and IAIG in promoting transparency, accountability, and responsible use of resources. They called for full operational independence, adequate resources, and direct access to the Executive Board- particularly in the context of ongoing reforms and budget constraints. They inquired how oversight bodies plan to contribute to broader efficiency and reform efforts. 11. Another delegation expressed appreciation for the work of the oversight offices and the value of informal dialogue. However, they voiced concern about fragmentation in addressing ethical breaches and disciplinary measures. They asked the UNDP AEAC to elaborate on its recommendation for a system-wide approach and sought clarity on coordination between oversight bodies at UNFPA and UNOPS to prevent siloed processes. 12. The UNDP Director of the Bureau for Management Services reaffirmed the organization\u2019s commitment to safeguarding independent oversight, particularly amid fiscal constraints. The Director underscored that these functions have consistently been protected to the fullest extent possible- an approach also acknowledged by the AEAC Chair. 13. The UNFPA Deputy Executive Director (Management), likewise reiterated the organization\u2019s commitment to a strong, independent, and well-resourced oversight function, noting its long- standing investments in this area despite financial constraints. 14. The UNOPS Deputy Executive Director (Delivery and Partnerships), confirmed the importance of ensuring the independence of IAIG, noting that adequate resources are key to effective oversight. 15. The Chair of the UNDP AEAC stressed that even \"satisfactory\" audit ratings require continued vigilance. He underscored the importance of collaboration among oversight bodies and identified the need to improve investigation timelines and compliance processes. He attributed the increase in reporting to expanded awareness-raising, the designation of ethics champions, and more visible management action on misconduct, particularly in the areas of whistleblower protections and safeguarding. 16. The UNFPA OAC representative confirmed that the committee operates with full independence and adequate resourcing, supported by management collaboration and unrestricted access to information. The representative reiterated the committee\u2019s readiness to respond to any further queries from the Board. 17. The Chair of the UNOPS AAC, responding to a question from a Bureau member on whether a \u201csatisfactory\u201d rating should be considered the ceiling for oversight performance, noted that the AAC generally considers it a matter of concern when more than 25 per cent of audit reports indicate a need for improvement. He added that the AAC monitors systemic issues, citing the case of Sustainable Investments in Infrastructure and Innovation (S3i) as both systemic and structural in nature. The Chair further underscored that the adequacy of the budgets and staffing of the IAIG and the Ethics Office remain areas of continued attention and regular dialogue with those offices. 18. The UNDP Director of OAI outlined a flexible approach to supporting UNDP through the United Nations reform initiatives, including enhanced advisory services to manage emerging risks.",

The UNDP Director of OAI outlined a flexible approach to supporting UNDP through the United Nations reform initiatives, including enhanced advisory services to manage emerging risks. He noted that any structural changes would also affect OAI and should be carefully sequenced to ensure continuity of support. Increased reporting was partially attributed to outreach efforts on protection from sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment (PSEAH), and to expanded training for staff. Updates to the investigations model include a more risk-based approach to case triage and internal reorganization to establish thematic specializations within the team\u2014focused on PSEAH, proactive investigations, artificial intelligence, and donor relations. He clarified that \u201cfully satisfactory\u201d remains the highest possible rating under the current system, although continued improvement is always the goal\u2014even when that rating is achieved. 19. The UNFPA Director of OAIS welcomed the role of oversight in supporting United Nations reform efforts, highlighting collaboration through networks such as UN-RIAS. He noted efforts to enhance reporting through multilingual tools, staff outreach via the Staff Council, and broader dissemination of findings. He emphasized that credibility stems from delivery and consistent enforcement of zero-tolerance policies, and commended management for its responsiveness. He DP/2025/20 25-11430 5 reaffirmed the role of OAIS in upholding strong internal controls and compliance in complex environments. 20. The UNOPS Director of IAIG confirmed that while IAIG has no formal role in the United Nations reform initiatives, it stands ready to provide advisory support upon request. He emphasized the importance of maintaining independence and avoiding conflicts of interest. He noted that regional training efforts had increased awareness of reporting mechanisms, reflected in the rise in complaints. He also reported that UNOPS had improved its audit rating to \u201cpartially satisfactory with minor improvement.\u201d While operational challenges persist in fragile settings, he stressed that IAIG\u2019s credibility depends on fairness, objectivity, and a rights-based approach. 21. The Executive Board adopted decision 2025/9 on the reports of UNDP, UNFPA and UNOPS on internal audit and investigation activities in 2024, and the corresponding management responses. III. Ethics 22. The UNDP Director of the Ethics Office presented the report on the activities of the UNDP Ethics Office in 2024 (DP/2025/11). The UNDP Director of the Bureau for Management Services delivered the management response. The UNFPA Ethics Adviser presented the report on the activities of the UNFPA Ethics Office in 2024 (DP/FPA/2025/7), with the UNFPA Deputy Executive Director (Management) providing the management response. The UNOPS Director of the Ethics Office presented the report on the activities of the UNOPS Ethics Office in 2024 (DP/OPS/2025/5), followed by the management response from the UNOPS Deputy Executive Director (Delivery and Partnerships). 23. A delegation commended the ethics offices for their essential role in upholding integrity, accountability, and ethical conduct across the three organizations. They underscored the importance of ensuring that ethics offices remain fully independent, adequately resourced, and actively engaged in supporting reforms and mitigating risks. They also posed a question regarding how the ethics offices would engage with ongoing reforms and what role they foresee for themselves in these processes. 24. The UNDP Director of the Ethics Office thanked the delegation for its comments and affirmed that, similar to the oversight offices, the Ethics Office stands ready to provide advice and guidance on emerging risks, and to support the implementation of decisions taken by the organization and Member States. 25. The UNFPA Ethics Adviser highlighted the critical importance of the Ethics Office during periods of restructuring, noting the potential rise in workplace concerns and risks of retaliation. She emphasized the continued relevance of the Ethics Office in safeguarding integrity and accountability, in line with its mandate under the Secretary-General\u2019s bulletin of 2007. 26.

He acknowledged the relevance of the question posed and expressed the Office\u2019s readiness to continue engaging in the dialogue. 27. The Executive Board adopted decision 2025/10 on the reports of the ethics offices of UNDP, UNFPA and UNOPS on activities in 2024, and the corresponding management responses. IV. Addressing racism and racial discrimination 28. The UNDP Director of the Bureau for Management Services, the UNFPA Deputy Executive Director (Management), and the UNOPS Deputy Executive Director (Delivery and Partnerships) updated the Executive Board on progress made in addressing racism and racial discrimination. The updates were provided on the implementation of the recommendations of the Joint Inspection Unit (JIU) contained in its note entitled Review of measures and mechanisms for addressing racism and DP/2025/20 6 25-11430 racial discrimination in United Nations system organizations: managing for achieving organizational effectiveness (JIU/NOTE/2022/1/Rev.1). 29. A Bureau member, speaking on behalf of a group of delegations, unequivocally condemned all forms of racism, affirming that such practices have no place in UNDP, UNFPA or UNOPS. They acknowledged the efforts made by the entities\u2014such as staff training in UNFPA, the promotion of a speak-up culture in UNDP, and data collection initiatives in UNOPS\u2014and encouraged greater transparency regarding persistent challenges. The speaker called for stronger inter-agency collaboration, particularly in the areas of voluntary self-identification and anti-racism efforts at the country level. They reaffirmed the need for sustained and holistic action to uphold human rights and zero tolerance for discrimination. 30. One delegation expressed strong support for the leadership of the Executive Board on this issue and condemned all manifestations of racism within the United Nations. Citing survey data, they welcomed actions undertaken by the three entities, while emphasizing the need to institutionalize anti-racism efforts, establish clear accountability mechanisms, and fully implement the JIU recommendations, including mechanisms for measuring progress. Another delegation commended the leadership and staff of the entities for their dedication to upholding integrity and preventing sexual exploitation, abuse, and harassment. They highlighted the importance of survivor-centred approaches and stressed the principles of transparency, accountability, and a respectful workplace culture. 31. The UNDP Director of the Bureau for Management Services noted that the organization\u2019s partnership policy prohibits collaboration with entities that act in contradiction to the principles of the United Nations Charter, including those engaging in racial discrimination. She highlighted the integration of anti-discrimination clauses in partnership agreements, strengthened engagement with marginalized groups, the rollout of anti-racism training, and the tracking of related cases through the Office of Audit and Investigations. Data on respectful behaviours and other elements of the organizational culture is monitored using various tools, including UNDPListens personnel surveys, in which participants are also invited to self-identify across a number of demographic categories, including race and ethnic origin. This enables more nuanced analysis of results and supports the identification of emerging issues. 32. The UNFPA Deputy Executive Director (Management) confirmed that all implementing partners are required to uphold United Nations principles, including a commitment to anti-racism. Since 2020, UNFPA has expanded its anti-racism initiatives, which include fostering diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), the launch of a new people strategy, and the facilitation of leadership dialogues. In 2024, a senior consultant was engaged to lead targeted learning initiatives on anti- racism. 33. The UNOPS Deputy Executive Director (Delivery and Partnerships) reiterated the organization\u2019s commitment to inter-agency collaboration on anti-racism.

The Executive Board adopted decision 2025/12 on addressing racism and racial discrimination. V. Protection against sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment 35. The UNDP Director of the Bureau for Management Services, the UNFPA Deputy Executive Director (Management), and the UNOPS Deputy Executive Director (Delivery and Partnerships) provided updates on efforts to prevent and respond to sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment (PSEAH). 36. A group of delegations commended the three entities for their continued commitment to fostering safe and inclusive organizational cultures. Underscoring that the protection of vulnerable populations is non-negotiable, they called for sustained funding, dedicated staffing, and victim/survivor-centred approaches. Delegations urged entities to focus on enhanced inter-agency DP/2025/20 25-11430 7 collaboration, harmonized tools, and expanded use of frameworks such as the Misconduct Disclosure Scheme (MDS). They also requested clarification on several entity-specific issues, such as the limits of UNDP\u2019s investigative authority, UNFPA\u2019s challenges in reporting, and UNOPS\u2019s efforts to engage with communities. 37. A delegation welcomed the prioritization of PSEAH and the adoption of a zero-tolerance stance by the three entities. Stressing the need to safeguard vulnerable populations, they called for improved coordination, prevention measures, and transparency. They emphasized the importance of an intersectional approach\u2014considering factors such as gender, age, disability, sexual orientation, and ethnicity\u2014and advocated for stronger whistleblower protections and more accessible, community-based complaint mechanisms, especially in fragile and conflict-affected settings. 38. The UNDP Director of the Bureau for Management Services reaffirmed the organization\u2019s commitment to PSEAH despite resource constraints. She highlighted the imminent appointment of a victim support officer and the establishment of a global network of over 170 focal points. She emphasized the value of inter-agency collaboration for enhancing efficiency and noted that while UNDP relies on its United Nations partners to deliver gender-based violence (GBV) services, this is challenged by funding reductions. The MDS is currently being piloted in five countries, with potential for expansion. It was clarified that, while UNDP does not have the mandate to investigate personnel of implementing partners, it works proactively to promote standards and provide advice on cases where investigation may be warranted. 39. The UNFPA Deputy Executive Director (Management) confirmed continued funding for PSEAH and announced the creation of a new specialist position. He noted the agency\u2019s leadership role on GBV prevention and response, its support for inter-agency coordination efforts, and the piloting of the MDS, with expansion under consideration. Complementarity with the ClearCheck platform is also being reviewed. Monitoring systems are in place, and a recent staff survey identified key deterrents to reporting\u2014such as fear of retaliation and lack of trust\u2014which are now being addressed to strengthen transparency and build confidence. 40. The UNOPS Deputy Executive Director (Delivery and Partnerships) reiterated that PSEAH remains a core organizational priority, integrated throughout operations and strongly supported by senior leadership. UNOPS is intensifying collaboration with UNDP and UNFPA, including joint efforts on prevention. The MDS is being piloted in three regions ahead of planned global implementation, and a context-specific PSEA community engagement guidance note is under development to support operations in remote areas. The Executive Board adopted decision 2025/11 on the joint update on protection against sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment. VI.

Update on the implementation efforts on the repositioning of the United Nations development system 41. The UNDP Associate Administrator, the UNFPA Deputy Executive Director (Management), and the UNOPS Deputy Executive Director (Delivery and Partnerships) provided updates on implementation efforts related to the repositioning of the United Nations development system. 42. A group of delegations stressed the urgency of fully implementing the United Nations development system reforms, particularly in light of growing demands and constrained resources. They welcomed the Secretary-General\u2019s UN80 initiative and identified four priority areas: (1) accelerating progress on shared services and common premises; (2) addressing delays in advancing the Management Accountability Framework (MAF); (3) strengthening the dual reporting model, including increased United Nations Resident Coordinator input into performance appraisals; and (4) ensuring full alignment of agency programmes with the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Frameworks (UNSDCF), including by sharing Resident coordinator alignment letters with the Executive Board. 43. Delegations reiterated their support for the UN80 initiative and for continued reforms of the Resident Coordinator system, highlighting the central role of the Resident Coordinator and DP/2025/20 8 25-11430 UNDP\u2019s function as a provider of common services and integrated policy advice. They emphasized the need to move from reform to full implementation of the 2024 quadrennial comprehensive policy review (QCPR), and to ensure agency activities are fully aligned with cooperation frameworks to reduce duplication and enhance coherence. 44. Delegations called for improved efficiency through shared services and common premises, stronger accountability, and better resource optimization, particularly in complex and fragile settings. Delegations also encouraged the mobilization of innovative, transparent, and domestic sources of financing, including from private and local actors, and called for inclusive, multi- stakeholder partnerships. They requested performance updates and clearer communication on the measurable impact of reform implementation. 45. The UNDP Associate Administrator reaffirmed the organization\u2019s support for joint business operations, implementation of the MAF, and coordination based on delivery capacity. He highlighted UNDP\u2019s leadership role in providing shared services\u2014including enterprise resource planning, payroll, and procurement\u2014which benefit over 70 United Nations entities, alongside the continued expansion of common back-office services. He confirmed that all UNDP country programme documents are aligned with the UNSDCFs, and that dual reporting has been institutionalized, although consistent input from Resident Coordinators remains a challenge. He underscored that, since 2018, UNDP has contributed over $120 million to the Resident Coordinator system\u2014comprising $80 million from its core resources under the UNSDG cost-sharing arrangement and an additional $42 million through the 1 per cent levy\u2014while cautioning that sustaining this level of contribution poses increasing risks in light of declining core resources. Cost- saving measures have included post reductions and relocations from high-cost duty stations. Further updates will be presented in the forthcoming strategic plan and integrated results and resources framework. 46. The UNFPA Deputy Executive Director (Management) emphasized that UN-to-UN transfers represent the largest source of UNFPA\u2019s non-core funding. He underlined UNFPA\u2019s leadership in joint business operations and participation in all six current common back-office locations, which have generated measurable cost savings. As co-chair of the Business Innovation Group, he called for broader engagement across agencies and trust-based collaboration. He reported that UNFPA had issued MAF guidance, conducted surveys to identify implementation challenges, and incorporated dual reporting into performance appraisal processes. Country programme documents are fully aligned with UNSDCFs, and Resident Coordinator confirmation letters are routinely submitted. UNFPA reiterated its strong commitment to the Resident Coordinator system, to timely cost-sharing contributions, and to performance transparency through the use of established reform indicators. 47.",

The UNOPS Deputy Executive Director (Delivery and Partnerships) outlined the organization\u2019s contributions to the efficiency agenda. She highlighted United Nations Web Buy Plus and human resources services as key global shared services provided by UNOPS to other United Nations entities. UNOPS also actively participates in the common back-office initiative, citing its partnership with UNICEF in Pakistan with a view to becoming a lead service provider. On the MAF, she welcomed efforts to streamline guidance and reaffirmed UNOPS support for the Resident Coordinator system and dual reporting, emphasizing the value of mutual feedback between Resident Coordinators and entity representatives. In 2024, UNOPS participated in 94 UNSDCFs and supported 13 common country analyses. In addition to the current indicators in the reform checklist, UNOPS is developing a set of results and performance indicators to inform its next Strategic Plan. She emphasized the importance of sharpening system-wide metrics to incentivize performance and enhancing collective communication to demonstrate the impact of reform. 48.

Update on the assessment of how the Executive Board executes its governance and oversight functions 49. The Executive Board received an update from the Co-Chair of the Joint Working Group of the Executive Boards of UNDP/UNFPA/UNOPS, UNICEF, and UN-Women on the governance and oversight functions of the Executive Boards and to examine the recommendations of the JIU report entitled Review of the governance and oversight functions of the Executive Boards of the UNDP, UNFPA, UNOPS, UNICEF and UN-Women (JIU/REP/2023/7). 50. The Co-Chair of the Joint Working Group provided an update on the progress of the group\u2019s work to assess and advance the recommendations of the JIU report. He recalled the group\u2019s establishment following the 2024 annual session and expressed appreciation to the 15 Member State representatives for their active engagement and collaborative spirit. The Co-Chair emphasized that the swift adoption of the group\u2019s term of reference and working methods- based on inclusivity, structure, and consensus- demonstrated strong commitment to strengthening governance and oversight across the four Boards. 51. The Co-Chair outlined the roadmap guiding the group\u2019s work, organized into four phases: (i) mapping and categorizing the JIU recommendations; (ii) identifying areas for early action; (iii) conducting in-depth review of more complex or structural issues; and (iv) preparing thematic clusters with supporting sub-groups to enable focused discussion. He noted that the group had already consulted with the JIU to revisit the recommendations in light of evolving financial and institutional contexts and underscored the importance of building early momentum while recognizing that it was premature to present \u201cquick wins\u201d at this stage. Nonetheless, the group saw value in identifying non-contentious, actionable items to build trust and demonstrate early progress. 52. Looking ahead, the Co-Chair confirmed that the next meeting of the Joint Working Group was scheduled for mid-July, where substantive discussions would begin. While the Terms of Reference anticipated decision points at each Board session, the group agreed that a case-by-case approach to decision-making would ensure relevance and alignment with the group\u2019s pace of work. Regular updates will be provided to maintain transparency. The Co-Chair concluded by reaffirming the time-bound nature of the mandate, the group\u2019s commitment to an agile and Member State-driven process, and its openness to supporting broader reform efforts through governance insights that may emerge over the course of its work. 53. A group of delegations welcomed the update, commended the collaborative spirit and early achievements of the Joint Working Group, and reiterated their support. They emphasized the importance of streamlining Board operations, strengthening accountability, and maintaining a transparent and results-oriented approach.",

They acknowledged progress but noted that Sustainable Development Goal 5 (SDG 5) remained off track, calling for sustained resources and strengthened institutional accountability. Concern was expressed over the potential repositioning of gender equality from a strategic priority to an accelerator in the forthcoming Strategic Plan. These delegations urged full implementation of the current strategy, deeper engagement with women\u2019s rights organizations, continued use of institutional tools such as the Gender Equality Seal, and support for gender-responsive policies and care systems. They also emphasized the importance of maintaining clarity and commitment amid global pushback on gender and human rights. 110. One delegation emphasized the importance of using language that reflects biological sex distinctions. DP/2025/20 16 25-11430 111. Another delegation welcomed UNDP\u2019s ongoing commitment to women\u2019s rights and supported the inclusion of gender equality as an accelerator in the draft Strategic Plan, 2026\u20132029. They underscored the development value of integrating women\u2019s perspectives and called for clarity on how gender equality and a human rights-based approach would be embedded across the new Plan\u2019s strategic objectives. The delegation also emphasized the importance of continued collaboration with UN-Women and UNFPA and asked how system-wide commitments would be reflected in the new results framework and budget. Visible gender equality leadership across all levels of the organization was underscored. 112. In response, the Director of the Bureau for Policy and Programme Support acknowledged concerns regarding constrained resources and noted that the decline in core funding remains a particular concern for UNDP, especially given that commitments to gender equality rely primarily on core resources. He highlighted innovative financing approaches, including the gender funding window as well as the integration of gender expertise into thematic initiatives such as biodiversity finance. He also referenced continued training for Resident Representatives and senior leaders on gender-responsive leadership. 113. The Executive Board took note of the 2024 annual report on the implementation of the UNDP Gender Equality Strategy, 2022\u20132025. XIII. UNDP country programmes and related matters 114.

While acknowledging the organization\u2019s achievements, delegations expressed concern over declining core resources. They urged the protection of flexible funding to sustain long-term planning and support in underserved contexts and encouraged UNFPA to further strengthen its efforts to diversify funding sources. 126. One delegation expressed opposition to UNFPA\u2019s engagement with another Member State, citing concerns about coercive population practices and invoking national legislation as the basis for funding restrictions. The delegation also questioned the allocation of resources to countries with substantial domestic capacity and called for greater transparency and accountability in programming. In exercising its right of reply, the cited Member State firmly rejected the allegations as unfounded, defended its population and development policies, and reaffirmed that its cooperation with UNFPA aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework. The delegation further criticized unilateral funding withdrawals as politically motivated, asserting that such actions undermine multilateralism and negatively impact global humanitarian efforts. Both delegations reiterated the importance of respectful dialogue and cooperation in advancing UNFPA\u2019s mandate. 127. In response, the Executive Director thanked delegations for their support to UNFPA and the Strategic Plan, 2026-2029. She reaffirmed UNFPA\u2019s commitment to achieving transformative results through partnerships, innovation, and accountability. On funding, she underscored the importance of core contributions and the need to safeguard services for those most in need. 128. The Executive Director rejected as unfounded the allegations raised by one Member State regarding UNFPA\u2019s work, noting that such claims had been repeatedly disproven, including by the Member State itself. She emphasized that UNFPA unequivocally opposes all forms of coercive practices, including forced sterilization and coerced abortion, and consistently advocates against such human rights violations. She reaffirmed that supporting UNFPA- the only United Nations agency dedicated to reproductive health and rights- helps reduce the risk of such practices. The Executive Director reiterated UNFPA\u2019s willingness to maintain an open dialogue with the Member State. DP/2025/20 18 25-11430 129. The Executive Board adopted decision 2025/17 on the progress report on the implementation of the UNFPA Strategic Plan, 2022-2025. XIV. UNFPA evaluation 130. The UNFPA Director of the Independent Evaluation Office (IEO) presented the 2024 annual report on the evaluation function (DP/FPA/2025/5), followed by the presentation of the management response by the UNFPA Deputy Executive Director (Programme) (DP/FPA/2025/CRP.5). 131. A group of delegations welcomed the report and commended both the IEO and UNFPA management for strong performance, innovative approaches, and effective collaboration. They noted high achievement across key indicators, including full implementation of decentralized evaluations and the highest rate of management action on recommendations in a decade. Delegations encouraged continued investment to meet the 1-1.6 per cent evaluation budget target, stronger support for decentralized and humanitarian evaluations, and innovation- particularly in the use of responsible artificial intelligence. Emphasizing youth engagement, evidence-based decision-making, and institutional learning, they reaffirmed the importance of a well-resourced, independent evaluation function as central to UNFPA\u2019s effectiveness and reform efforts. 132. A delegation acknowledged the performance of the IEO and UNFPA\u2019s commitment to implementing evaluation recommendations. They stressed the value of evaluations in shaping the draft Strategic Plan, 2026\u20132029, while expressing concern over evaluation spending falling below the 1 per cent target. The delegation inquired about the implications of this funding gap and the availability of preliminary findings from the evaluation on leaving no one behind, and extended appreciation to the outgoing Director of the IEO. 133. In response, the IEO Director reiterated the importance of maintaining evaluation funding, especially during financial constraints, emphasizing that \u201cinvesting 1 per cent ensures the other 99 per cent is well-spent\u201d. He cautioned that underfunding limits the IEO\u2019s ability to incorporate project-level evaluations into its quality assurance system. He confirmed that preliminary findings from the leaving no one behind evaluation had already been shared with senior management.",

The Forum secretariat provided a brief update on its activities related to communication and outreach, including activities during the 2025 International Day of Forests. 12. During the general discussion, several representatives spoke, highlighting the following main points: (a) Many representatives welcomed the activities undertaken by the Forum secretariat in advancing communication and outreach work, including the Forum\u2019s monthly updates, and encouraged the secretariat to continue its work, raise awareness of forest issues across the United Nations system and related processes, modernize the Forum website and boost its social media presence; E/2025/42 E/CN.18/2025/7 25/36 (b) Many representatives referred to their national activities in celebration of International Day of Forests and considered it an opportunity to raise awareness of the significance of forests and strengthen commitment to sustainable forest management. The day brought together national institutions, civil society, traditional leaders and other relevant stakeholders and promoted sustainable forest management outside the forest sector; (c) Many representatives recognized and welcomed the initiative of the secretariat in organizing the Forest Pavilion during the twenty-ninth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, as it attracted many stakeholders outside the traditional forestry sector. They encouraged the secretariat to organize similar events during Conferences of the Parties to all Rio conventions, including the thirtieth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, as part of a wider communication strategy of the Forum secretariat to raise awareness of forests and promote synergy on forests, climate change, biodiversity and land; (d) Many other representatives recognized the important role of the Forum secretariat in raising awareness of forests in various global forums and in promoting synergy and coherence on forest-related issues. Considering the ongoing United Nations liquidity crisis, however, they encouraged the secretariat to take a flexible approach in advancing this task, assess the impacts and cost-efficiency of the Forest Pavilion and make the Forest Pavilion a \u201ccase-by-case\u201d initiative during Conferences of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and Conferences of the Parties to the other Rio conventions. In this respect, these representatives disagreed with the proposal to institutionalize the Forest Pavilion during Conferences of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; (e) The representative of the host country of the thirtieth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change clarified that the programme for the session had not yet been finalized and that more clarity on the issue would be given in Bonn, Germany, in May 2025. As of now, there were several thematic pavilions at the thirtieth session, including one on nature; (f) The representative of FAO, on behalf of the Collaborative Partnership on Forests, announced that \u201cForests and economies\u201d would be the theme of International Day of Forests in 2026. 13. In response to some comments about the Forest Pavilion, the Director of the Forum secretariat explained that the first Forest Pavilion was aimed at enhancing the coherence and contribution of forests to the global fight against climate change, in line with the Forum\u2019s guidance. The resources were provided by stakeholders who were outside the Forum\u2019s traditional donors, including the Asian Development Bank and the Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation.

During the interactive discussion, several representatives spoke, highlighting the following main points: (a) Several representatives indicated that the integration of ecosystem service valuations into policymaking and decision-making processes will enable more informed, evidence-based environmental management. Aligning investments and policies with the economic and ecological value of forests is critical to ensuring their effective management and conservation; (b) Several representatives indicated their actions at the national level for valuing forests, such as biodiversity valuation banks and conservation payment programmes. Some representatives highlighted market-based mechanisms such as payment for ecosystem services, as well as a forest environment tax to mobilize domestic resources, to distribute benefits to communities for the conservation and management of forests. Some representatives indicated that their countries had developed innovative mechanisms for the buying and selling of ecosystem services; (c) Several representatives highlighted the challenges they are facing in valuing forest services, including the data gap in valuation, and their organization. Diverse ecosystems also make it difficult to generalize the services and respective valuations. There is no established market for sellers and buyers of services in many countries, and a lack of standards makes it difficult to compare different valuations. In several places, there is underrepresentation of people in vulnerable situations, such as Indigenous Peoples. Values also shift over time, so how to make valuation time dynamic is challenging. Valuation is still at the micro level and needs to be scaled up to lead to macro solutions; (d) Many representatives shared their lessons learned regarding forest valuation. The efforts should be multidisciplinary. A modular approach should be adopted to advance national accounting. There is not one approach fit for all in an ecosystem, and it is important to apply an inclusive and participatory approach. Private family forests are important \u2013 it is important to value them \u2013 for the services they provide; (e) Several representatives pointed out that communicating forest values is important to further promote the integration of forest valuation into national policies and strategies. Consistent methods should be used. Institutionalization and creating a regulatory environment are important. Significant investment and financing are needed, through various innovative mechanisms. Summary of the discussion of agenda item 3 (e) 16. The Forum secretariat introduced the note by the Secretariat contained in document E/CN.18/2025/4. The Director of the secretariat also informed the Forum about the latest developments and progress in consultations on the establishment of the Global Forest Financing Facilitation Network office in China.

The head of the office operates and works under the direct supervision of the Director of the Forum secretariat. The programme of work of the office will be consistent with and complement the programme of work of the Forum secretariat on the Global Forest Financing Facilitation Network. The secretariat will be the interface with Member States, the Bureau of the Forum and United Nations bodies and entities. All requests by Member States for assistance from the Network will be sent to the Forum secretariat for an appropriate decision and follow-up action, including for execution by the office. 19. The office will regularly submit reports on its activities and the implementation of its programme of work to the Forum secretariat. The secretariat will report to the Forum on the activities of the office. The office will be managed and administered by the Department of Economic and Social Affairs, like all the Department\u2019s other offices in different countries, and will operate in accordance with applicable United Nations regulations, rules, policies and procedures. The full administrative and operational costs of the office will be funded from extrabudgetary sources from the host country\u2019s voluntary contributions. No office costs will be paid through the United Nations regular budget or the Forum trust fund. 20. The office is expected to be operational for a minimum of six years, from 2025 to 2030, which can be extended subject to mutual agreement. A steering committee consists of representatives from the Department of Economic and Social Affairs and the host Government and will be established by the Department to provide advice to the head of the office on the operational aspects of the work of the office, including its annual workplan, programme implementation and the use of funds by the office. In addition, to ensure the engagement of Forum members and partners, an international advisory group, consisting of a select number of Forum members and partners, will be established by the Department. The group will advise the steering committee on the substantive thematic focus of the annual programme of work of the office. 21. Furthermore, during the sixth formal round of consultations from 27 March to 1 April 2025, major progress was made by cleaning up three quarters of the pending legal issues in the draft host country agreement. There are a few legal, financial and operational issues in the memorandum of understanding that remain to be discussed. Both sides agreed to hold the next round of consultations soon after the twentieth session of the Forum, with a view to concluding the negotiation on the draft host country agreement and draft memorandum of understanding. 22. During the general discussion, several representatives spoke, highlighting the following main points: (a) Many representatives emphasized the significance of the provision of international financial, technological and capacity-building support to developing countries to supplement their national efforts in advancing the implementation of the United Nations strategic plan for forests 2017\u20132030 and its global forest goals; E/2025/42 E/CN.18/2025/7 28/36 25-08073 (b) Many representatives welcomed the support provided by the Global Forest Financing Facilitation Network to members of the Forum, such as joint work with the Global Environment Facility and the International Union for Conservation of Nature on primary forests, and the support provided to members of the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization, requested the secretariat to continue to provide such support to members and called for increased financial and human resources to support the work of the Network; (c) Many representatives supported the establishment of the Network\u2019s proposed office in Beijing as an effective means for scaling up capacity-building support for Forum members; (d) Many representatives emphasized that no resources from the United Nations regular budget and the Forum trust fund should be used for the operation of the Network\u2019s proposed office; (e) Some representatives highlighted the importance of ensuring a clear delineation of tasks between the Forum secretariat and the Network\u2019s proposed office in Beijing; (f) One representative questioned the need for an exter",

The representative also called for reconsideration of the Forum\u2019s decision on the establishment of the proposed office at the next session of the Forum; (g) Many representatives recognized the significance of the provision of and access to forest financing data knowledge and information, and called for improved collaboration among data providers, including within the Collaborative Partnership on Forests, as well as the important role of the Network\u2019s clearing house in this respect; (h) Referring to the proposal on developing a global hub as a one-stop shop for forest financing data, some representatives recognized the added value of the provision of access to comprehensive data, information and knowledge on forest financing, but indicated that a prior analysis of the impacts of the work of the Network\u2019s clearing house, the possible cost implications of developing the global hub and ensuring the engagement of relevant members of the Collaborative Partnership on Forests in this exercise are important factors to be considered in the process. 23. In response to some comments, the Director of the Forum secretariat indicated that the full administrative and operational costs of the office will be funded from extrabudgetary sources from the host country\u2019s voluntary contributions. No office costs will be paid through the United Nations regular budget or Forum trust fund. Staff of the Global Forest Financing Facilitation Network are needed at the Forum secretariat in New York to review country requests for assistance from the Network, the preparation of official reports on the Network to the Forum and other related normative work, as well as daily interaction and coordination with the office. With regard to the global hub, she emphasized that the aim is to strengthen partnership among the main global data providers, building on the work of the Network\u2019s clearing house, with the objective of serving countries and stakeholders, using existing mechanisms and resources. Developing the global hub is a long-term exercise that must be done through a stepwise approach and at this stage no resources are required. It is just to begin a systematic and strategic partnership among the main data providers. 24. Under agenda item 3 (e), a panel discussion was organized on the significance of a global hub on data, information and knowledge on forest financing opportunities and best practices and the role of the Global Forest Financing Facilitation Network E/2025/42 E/CN.18/2025/7 29/36 clearing house. The panel consisted of representatives of Germany, Brazil, FAO and the Global Environment Facility secretariat and was moderated by the representative of Canada. In their presentations, all panel speakers recognized the importance of the provision of and access to data, knowledge and information on forest financing and supported the proposal for developing a global hub, building on the work of the clearing house. Developing a global hub requires closer collaboration among members of the Collaborative Partnership on Forests. It paves the way for unlocking finance for forests. It is important to collect data related to different types of financing for forests, such as data on blended financing and biodiversity financing, and to address the challenges related to data gaps, the lack of a unified and agreed methodology and indicators to generate new data, and issues related to the harmonization and organization of available data. 25. During the interactive discussion, several representatives made statements, highlighting the following main points: (a) Some representatives emphasized the importance of strengthening the capacity of Forum members to be able to develop projects for submission to multilateral funding institutions and requested the Forum secretariat to conduct such training workshops, including through virtual means; (b) Some countries emphasized the need to ensure that forest financing is accessib",

In reacting to the feedback from representatives, panellists supported the organization of virtual training workshops and courses on project development for submission to multilateral institutions. The importance of sharing best practices among countries of the South was also emphasized. With regard to data about the share of forest cooperatives in financing forests, it was indicated that there were no specific data, and more work needed to be done on this matter in the future.

She reviewed the secretariat\u2019s responsibilities and staffing from 2000 to 2015 and its expanding activities in seven core work areas during the period between the reviews of the international arrangement on forests in 2015 and 2024, as well as its expanding activities as a member of the Collaborative Partnership on Forests and as its secretariat, as a division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs and as part of United Nations Headquarters in New York. She concluded that, while the secretariat\u2019s regular budget staff complement had remained fixed at 12 posts since 2016, the secretariat\u2019s responsibilities, activities and deliverables had significantly expanded over time in several core areas of the Forum\u2019s mandate. These expanding activities have created a challenging situation, which the secretariat has met primarily by relying heavily on extrabudgetary resources from the Forum trust fund to supplement its regular budget resources. However, this is not a sustainable situation due to its unpredictable nature and has created uncertainty for the supported staff and the deliverables on which they work. For the secretariat to perform its responsibilities and mandates in an efficient, effective and sustainable manner, she suggested five new regular posts: four focused on communication and outreach (P-3/P-4), finance and administration (P-3), capacity-building (P-4/P-5) and website management, including needed upgrades (General Service), and the post of a full-time secretary of the Collaborative Partnership on Forests (P-4). She suggested that the programme and budget implications of these suggestions be considered at the twenty-first session of the Forum in 2026. 30. During the general discussion, several representatives made statements, highlighting the following main points: (a) Many representatives recognized the detailed useful information provided in the information paper about the work of the Forum secretariat, which helps them __________________ 24 See www.un.org/esa/forests/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Information-Paper_Workload-Gaps- and-Needs-of-the-UNFFS.pdf. E/2025/42 E/CN.18/2025/7 31/36 to have a better understanding of the scope and nature of the activities of the secretariat; (b) Many representatives indicated that they needed more time to review the paper and its content, and suggested continuing discussion of the paper at the next session of the Forum; (c) Several representatives opposed the suggestion made in the paper regarding the preparation of a programme budget implication for consideration at the twenty-first session of the Forum on the addition of five new regular budget-funded posts; (d) Many representatives recognized the current global financial situation, the ongoing United Nations liquidity crisis and the limited resources of the secretariat, and indicated that the secretariat should prioritize and sequence implementation of the Forum\u2019s decisions, in close consultation with Member States; (e) Several representatives recognized the decline in the allocation of resources to the Forum trust fund and the secondment of Collaborative Partnership on Forests staff to the Forum secretariat, and encouraged the secretariat to use its resources more efficiently and focus on the priority tasks related to its core mandates, reduce its number of meetings and associated travel and make further efforts to mobilize funding from donors and various stakeholders to support its work; (f) Several representatives thanked the Forum secretariat for its activities in support of countries in the areas of monitoring, assessment and reporting, forest financing, data access and communication and outreach, and called for strengthened resources for the secretariat to continue its capacity-building support to Forum members; (g) One representative indicated that rebalancing regular budget-funded posts to support the Forum would be a more equitable way to address this issue. The Department of Economic and Social Affairs has over 400 posts and the representative suggested that, if Forum members believe that additional staff are needed for the Forum secretariat, the Council should consider the secretariat\u2019s staffing relative to the Department\u2019s other subprogrammes and that members make a recommendation to that effect at the twenty-first session of the Forum; (h) Some representatives said that they understood the challenges that the Forum secretariat was facing. However, consideration of the secretariat\u2019s resource needs and gaps should be made in the broader context of United Nations reform.",

However, consideration of the secretariat\u2019s resource needs and gaps should be made in the broader context of United Nations reform. In addition, this issue is also related to the result of the ongoing consultation on the establishment of the Global Forest Financing Facilitation Network office in Beijing; (i) One representative suggested that the Forum explore the possibility of transitioning towards a binding agreement or formal convention, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity or the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, and discuss it further in the next policy session in 2026. 31. In response to the comments, the Director of the Forum secretariat indicated that the secretariat\u2019s mandates had grown, but its capacity gap had not been addressed. The outcomes of the nineteenth session of the Forum contain over 120 actions, of which 35 are direct requests to the secretariat. As a division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs and part of United Nations Headquarters, the volume of the secretariat\u2019s work has also expanded in recent years due to the annualization of the United Nations programme and budget process; increased input to sessions of the Council, the high-level political forum and the General Assembly; contributions to new General Assembly forest-related initiatives; and compliance with new United Nations system-wide management initiatives. The ongoing United Nations liquidity crisis is directly and significantly affecting delivery of the mandate, as there is E/2025/42 E/CN.18/2025/7 32/36 25-08073 currently a complete hiring freeze, and the secretariat is unable to fill an existing P-4 vacant post, has lost a P-5 position in support of the Global Forest Financing Facilitation Network and is highly unlikely to be able to replace a G-6 support staff role when the incumbent retires in a few months. The Director stressed that reliance on extrabudgetary resources to support the Forum\u2019s long-term core issues is unsustainable, although the secretariat continues its resource mobilization efforts. Summary of the discussion of agenda item 5 32. The Forum secretariat introduced the note by the Secretariat contained in document E/CN.18/2025/6. During the interactive discussion, several representatives made statements. The following main points emerged from the discussion: (a) Many representatives emphasized the importance of the provision of voluntary contributions to the Forum trust fund to enable the Forum secretariat to fulfil its responsibilities in the areas of monitoring, assessment and reporting, the Global Forest Financing Facilitation Network, communication and outreach activities; (b) Some representatives called for other countries beyond the traditional donor countries to contribute to the Forum trust fund and encouraged the secretariat to also reach out to philanthropic organizations to mobilize support; (c) Several representatives called for increased voluntary contributions to the Forum trust fund to support the continuation of the Forum secretariat\u2019s capacity development for members and partners, and expressed concerns over the lack of resources for the participation of representatives of developing countries and Forum partners in Forum meetings and events. Referring to the universal membership of the Forum and its inclusive nature, the representatives expressed concerns that the lack of resources to support the participation of Forum members and partners would lead to imbalanced and non-inclusive policy decision-making at the Forum and have a negative impact on the inclusive and participatory nature of the Forum. 33. The Director of the Forum secretariat thanked all those countries that had contributed to the Forum trust fund and indicated that the absence of resources in the fund would negatively affect the implementation of the outcome of the nineteenth session of the Forum. It is critical to implement the Forum\u2019s decisions in the lead-up to the final review of the international arrangement on forests in 2030. Summary of the discussion of agenda item 6 34. The discussion on emerging issues was facilitated by a panel on dryland forests comprising representatives of Mongolia,25 Saudi Arabia,26 Botswana27 and the Global Environment Facility28 and moderated by the representative of the Southern African Development Community secretariat.

E/2025/42 E/CN.18/2025/7 33/36 (a) Many representatives highlighted the significance of dryland forests due to the wide range of services and their role in addressing climate change, combating desertification, contributing to food security and eradicating poverty. These vulnerable ecosystems face important challenges and are affected by unsustainable land use policies and activities, droughts and high temperature, among other things. These forests are essential for combating desertification, protecting biodiversity, water regulation, combating dust and sand storms, improving livelihoods and protecting the soil. It is crucial to conserve these forests and enhance their resilience to droughts and wildfires; (b) Many representatives called for enhanced international cooperation and increased funding to promote the sustainable management of dryland forests. Members of the Collaborative Partnership on Forests and the Forum should support countries\u2019 efforts in the context of the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration; (c) Several representatives reported on their national activities for sustainably managing and conserving dryland forests. Despite these efforts, countries face several challenges, especially in the areas of finance, technology and capacity-building. They emphasized the Forum\u2019s mandate and the United Nations strategic plan for forests 2017\u20132030, as well as technical committees such as the FAO working group on dryland forests and agro-silvopastoral systems, and the need to address issues related to all types of forests in a holistic and integrated manner.

C. Input from the twentieth session of the Forum to the 2025 high-level political forum on sustainable development30 37. The contributions of forests and the ecosystem services they provide are often undervalued or unrecorded in both national and international policy and economic frameworks. To address this gap, the Forum, its members and its stakeholders have continuously taken a wide range of sustainable, inclusive and science- and evidence- based actions to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and leave no one behind, bearing in mind the environmental, economic and social dimensions of sustainable development and the interlinkages across the Goals and their targets. These include actions at the policy, technical and operational levels to address the root causes, such as drivers of deforestation and degradation of forests, and promote sustainable forest management through a multistakeholder and cross-sectoral approach. 38. In line with global forest goal 1, countries have taken legislative and policy steps to combat forest loss and degradation, using existing laws and strategies as frameworks. Many have updated these tools through stakeholder consultations. Some have enacted laws to ensure deforestation-free markets. Despite coordination challenges, efforts have been made to integrate forest concerns across sectors such as energy and agriculture. In line with global forest goal 3, many countries have taken concrete steps to protect and sustainably manage forests. They introduced laws and policies supporting protected areas, sustainable management and markets for sustainably sourced forest products. As a result, about 18 per cent of global forests are now protected, and more forests are under long-term management plans. However, progress varies across regions. In line with global forest goal 5, many countries have established forest-related laws and policies, but enforcement varies, affecting their effectiveness. To combat illegal logging and trade, countries have introduced monitoring systems and traceability measures and undertaken international cooperation efforts. 39. The following messages are suggested for inclusion in the ministerial declaration of the 2025 high-level political forum on sustainable development: (a) Recognize the broad economic, social and environmental benefits of forests, including watershed protection, food and medicine, and human well-being, and integrate forests into national and global responses to sustainable development challenges; (b) Address rising threats from forest fires and wildfires, pests and diseases exacerbated by climate change through active forest management and silvicultural practices, especially in dry and arid regions; __________________ 30 This input accompanies the input by the Bureau of the Forum at its twentieth session for the 2025 high-level political forum, which is available at https://hlpf.un.org/sites/default/files/ vnrs/2025/Inputs%202025%20UNFF.pdf. E/2025/42 E/CN.18/2025/7 36/36 25-08073 (c) Urgently advance implementation of the United Nations strategic plan for forests 2017\u20132030 and halt deforestation and land degradation by 2030; (d) Encourage participatory decision-making that includes Indigenous Peoples, local communities and women, ensuring that forest management is equitable, inclusive and reflective of diverse perspectives; (e) Mobilize and increase resources from all sources to mainstream forest management into development strategies, enhance cross-sector collaboration and contribute to sustainable development. D. Input from the twentieth session of the Forum to the 2026 high-level political forum on sustainable development31 40. The Forum, along with its members and stakeholders, has consistently undertaken a wide range of actions to accelerate implementation of the United Nations strategic plan for forests 2017\u20132030 in support of advancement towards Sustainable Development Goals 6, 7, 9, 11 and 17. These actions leverage the role of forests in delivering broad benefits across all three dimensions of sustainable development and reinforcing interlinkages among the Goals and their targets.",

These actions leverage the role of forests in delivering broad benefits across all three dimensions of sustainable development and reinforcing interlinkages among the Goals and their targets. Some countries and regions reported consistent efforts to promote sustainable and multifunctional forest management to enhance the effective use of forests and address the growing and competing demands for forest products and services. Countries, the private sector and academia have promoted the use of wood in construction and energy, supporting Goals 7, 9 and 11. They have used policies, incentives and investments to boost innovation in forest-based industries. Collaboration is driving technological advances in sustainable wood materials and energy products, aiding industry development. Innovative financing methods are increasingly used to support forest conservation and ecosystem services. 41. The following messages are suggested for inclusion in the ministerial declaration of the 2026 high-level political forum on sustainable development: (a) Recognize the multiple values and contributions of forests and sustainable forest management to sustainable development in its three dimensions in providing essential ecosystem services, livelihoods and raw materials, as well as enhancing environmental resilience, which serves as a foundation and safeguard for advancing Sustainable Development Goals 6, 7, 9, 11 and 17; (b) Emphasize the need for accelerated implementation of the United Nations strategic plan for forests 2017\u20132030 as an effective means for the achievement of the Goals and to enhance cooperation, coordination, coherence and synergies on forest- related issues at all levels in support of the implementation of the Paris Agreement, the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework and the Land Degradation Neutrality Target Setting Programme; (c) Mobilize resources from all sources for sustainable forest management and the achievement of the global forest goals as an essential measure to maximize the contribution of forests to the Goals. __________________ 31 The format of the input to the 2026 high-level political forum may need to be reorganized and adjusted to align with the relevant template to be provided by the President of the Council. 25-08073 (E) 130625 *2508073*",

The Executive Board adopted the annotated provisional agenda and workplan for the first regular session 2025 (UNW/2025/L.1/Rev.1) and approved the report on its second regular session 2024 held from 10 to 11 September 2024 (UNW/2024/8).

The Executive Board adopted four decisions (2025/1, 2025/2, 2025/3 and 2025/4), which are contained in the annex to the present report. III. Opening statements 5. The newly elected President of the Executive Board opened the session by stressing the Bureau\u2019s continued commitment to strengthening the effectiveness of the Executive Board\u2019s oversight function for improved governance while building on the hard work of the previous Bureaux. She outlined the different reports and briefings to be presented during the first regular session, and the decisions to be negotiated. 6. In her opening statement, the Under-Secretary-General/Executive Director congratulated the newly elected President and Bureau and thanked last year\u2019s President and Vice-Presidents. After highlighting the different milestones to be celebrated in 2025, she went on to detail the six sub-themes identified in the Secretary-General\u2019s report on the Beijing+30 Action Agenda: (1) bridging the digital gap; (2) addressing poverty; (3) ending violence against women and girls; (4) advancing women\u2019s leadership and decision-making; (5) advancing women, peace and security commitments; and (6) prioritizing women and girls in climate justice. She added that across these six areas, there is a critical cross-cutting goal: to meaningfully engage young women and girls. 7. Discussing the current financial situation, the Under-Secretary- General/Executive Director noted that the Entity is celebrating its 15-year anniversary in a vastly different operating environment: one in which multilateral action on the rights and empowerment of women and girls has grown increasingly complex and development finance continues to decline, while earmarking rises.",

She added that across these six areas, there is a critical cross-cutting goal: to meaningfully engage young women and girls. 7. Discussing the current financial situation, the Under-Secretary- General/Executive Director noted that the Entity is celebrating its 15-year anniversary in a vastly different operating environment: one in which multilateral action on the rights and empowerment of women and girls has grown increasingly complex and development finance continues to decline, while earmarking rises. She added that UN-Women\u2019s 2024 resourcing underscored the acceleration of these trends, signalling a long-term trajectory of non-core resources outweighing core resources. She went on to explain that in the last two to three years, over half of UN-Women\u2019s top 20 core donors have shifted their development policy in ways that weaken support for the UN and UN-Women. She stressed that for UN-Women to fulfil its mandate, it is critical that it has the means to reach the women and girls it serves. The Head of the Entity said that she values the friendship with the Executive Board and asked for a financial commitment that matches this valuable friendship. She reiterated UN-Women\u2019s commitment to continuing to achieve the best possible results with the resources that Member States entrust to the Entity. Given the UNW/2025/1 3/20 constrained financial situation, the Head of the Entity assured the Executive Board that UN-Women was taking the necessary steps to contain costs and anchor its work in its founding resolution and the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, as well as other key intergovernmental standards. 8. Discussing the pivot to the country and regions initiative, the Under- Secretary-General/Executive Director shared that the pivot is about strengthening UN-Women\u2019s delivery on the ground and leveraging the Entity\u2019s triple mandate at the regional and country levels to achieve tangible changes in the lives of women and girls. The pivot includes prioritizing the country level and empowering UN-Women Representatives and Regional Directors with greater authority. It includes moving some 190 positions from New York to Nairobi and Bonn, to be closer to the women and girls that UN-Women serves and to leverage cost efficiencies. The Head of UN-Women shared that the Entity expects to save a minimum of $8 million per year once the changes are completed. She acknowledged that these post relocations are inevitably unsettling and disruptive for some of the workforce and she commended the workforce for the spirit with which they are approaching these changes. She thanked the Staff Council for their excellent support in making these changes work as best as they can for everyone who works for UN-Women and for being a key part of the extensive consultation process. She added that UN- Women aims to make this transition as smooth and successful as possible for its work and workforce. 9. Despite these organizational shifts, the Under-Secretary- General/Executive Director reaffirmed UN-Women\u2019s commitment to fulfilling Member States\u2019 promises to women and girls. She noted that UN-Women will remain resolute in its mission to end violence against women and to drive their economic empowerment, breaking the persistent cycles of poverty that hold them back. She further expressed UN-Women\u2019s continued support to women\u2019s political participation across the world, through helping amend electoral laws and building the capacities of female candidates. Additionally, she noted that UN-Women will continue to address the gender impacts of climate change and amplify the voices of women impacted by war. She added that UN-Women is leveraging its roles in the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) to bring a gender analysis to humanitarian responses, ensuring that every dollar not only meets the needs of women and girls, but also unlocks their full potential, empowering them to contribute to their communities\u2019 recovery and resilience. She underscored that UN-Women has worked to advocate for the rights of women and girls in the most difficult contexts, where their voices most need to be heard and the voice of UN-Women is most needed to support them. 10. In conclusion, the Under-Secretary-General/Executive Director urged Member States to breathe new life into the beleaguered multilateral system. She stressed that it is our most powerful tool and best path to peace, sustainable development and much more. She added that the United Nations was born out of challenging times and that the stressors upon its work only affirm its indispensability.",

She added that the United Nations was born out of challenging times and that the stressors upon its work only affirm its indispensability.

In turn, she asked Member States to match their stated support with action. UNW/2025/1 4/20 11. After the floor was opened, numerous delegations congratulated the President and Vice-Presidents on their election and thanked the Under- Secretary-General/Executive Director for her comprehensive remarks and steadfast leadership. Several delegations highlighted how 2025 is a defining year for gender equality as it marks the thirtieth anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, the twentieth anniversary of the UN Security Council resolution 1325 and the fifteenth anniversary of UN-Women, and only five years remain to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Delegations noted that despite the progress achieved, gender inequality continues to manifest in many forms. They shared that 2025 provides a critical opportunity to reflect on progress, address persistent challenges and reaffirm their collective commitment to gender equality. Several speakers reiterated their support for UN-Women\u2019s triple mandate and commended the Entity\u2019s pivotal role in promoting progress and honouring commitments to achieve gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment. Delegations noted that the development of the UN-Women Strategic Plan 2026\u20132029 offers an opportunity to set a strong course ahead, with some speakers calling on UN-Women to draw on lessons learned from past efforts and recent evaluations and reviews, and to consider including a chapter that defines its comparative advantages within the United Nations development system. Several speakers encouraged UN-Women to prioritize women\u2019s economic empowerment and women, peace and security in its next strategic plan, as well as to continue to leverage its coordination mandate to push for system-wide gender mainstreaming in line with the Gender Equality Acceleration Plan. One delegation urged UN-Women to avoid focusing on \u201cradical\u201d causes, such as diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) and gender \u201cideology\u201d. On the pivot to the regions and countries initiative, Member States welcomed the update by the Under-Secretary-General/Executive Director and encouraged UN-Women to provide regular updates to the Executive Board on the implementation of this organizational change, so as to ensure adequate oversight. Similarly, delegations expressed interest in receiving updates on the implementation of the recommendations from the Joint Inspection Unit\u2019s review of governance and oversight of the Executive Boards of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)/the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)/the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS), the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) and UN-Women. In a joint statement, 31 Member States reiterated the importance of the 2024 quadrennial comprehensive policy review (QCPR) as it provides the United Nations development system with a vital framework to accelerate SDG progress, and called on United Nations development system entities to harmonize reporting practices. Some delegations noted with concern the financial constraints facing UN-Women and underscored the importance of sustainable and predictable funding. Another delegation pressed UN-Women to stringently adhere to its mandate and encouraged the Entity to focus on promoting concepts that enjoy intergovernmental support. Finally, several delegations emphasized the importance of this year\u2019s Commission on the Status of Women to review the progress of the implementation of the Beijing Declaration Platform for Action and to reaffirm commitments made 30 years ago. IV. Audit matters 12. In her opening remarks for this item, the Deputy Executive Director noted with appreciation the collaborative efforts between the United Nations UNW/2025/1 5/20 Board of Auditors and UN-Women. She welcomed the thirteenth consecutive unqualified audit opinion from the Board of Auditors, while adding that UN- Women\u2019s revenue in 2023 reflects its partners\u2019 strong confidence in the Entity.",

In her opening remarks for this item, the Deputy Executive Director noted with appreciation the collaborative efforts between the United Nations UNW/2025/1 5/20 Board of Auditors and UN-Women. She welcomed the thirteenth consecutive unqualified audit opinion from the Board of Auditors, while adding that UN- Women\u2019s revenue in 2023 reflects its partners\u2019 strong confidence in the Entity. The Deputy Executive Director expressed gratitude to the Board of Auditors for their support of UN-Women. She highlighted that this is the first audit after the launch of the enterprise risk management system, Quantum. The Deputy Executive Director concluded by stating that the Entity has achieved a record 92 per cent implementation rate and a fourth consecutive year with no long- outstanding recommendations. 13. The United Nations Board of Auditors Representative and Director of External Audit of Brazil presented the report of the Board of Auditors on the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023 (A/79/5/Add.12). In the opinion of the Board of Auditors, the financial statements presented fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of UN-Women as at 31 December 2023 and its financial performance and cash flows for the year ended on that date, in accordance with the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS). The Board of Auditors identified that the Entity\u2019s formula for allocating core resources requires updating. Other areas of improvement include the assurance activities life cycle and timely reconciliation of payments through Quantum in collaboration with UNDP. Regarding follow-up of previous recommendations, the Board of Auditors noted that of the 26 outstanding previous recommendations, 92 per cent were fully implemented and 8 per cent were under implementation. 14. The Director of the Management and Administration Division ad interim introduced the financial report and audited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023 (A/79/5/Add.12), with total revenue of $619 million. Total expenses were $546 million and the Entity recorded an accounting surplus of $79.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2023, compared with $131 million in 2022. This accounting surplus represents contractual funds available to UN-Women\u2019s programmatic activities in future years. Total contribution revenue had decreased by $61 million, while total expenses had increased by $10 million compared with 2022. UN-Women assets include mainly cash and cash equivalents of $210 million, investments of $624 million and contributions receivable of $529 million. Total assets increased by 10 per cent to $1.5 billion, mainly due to an increase in cash, cash developments, and investments. On revenue by funding type, it was noted that regular resources increased to $164 million and investment revenue increased by $12 million. 15. The Director of the Strategy, Planning, Resources and Effectiveness Division gave an update on UN-Women\u2019s implementation of the recommendations of the Board of Auditors, as well as the resulting impact. She highlighted that UN-Women had achieved an unprecedented 92 per cent implementation rate of recommendations from previous years. She shared that the implementation of audit recommendations had positive impacts that aligned with five organizational effectiveness and efficiency output areas of UN- Women\u2019s strategic plan. These areas are: (i) principled performance, noting improvements in risk assessment and validation; (ii) advancing partnerships and resourcing, highlighting elevated transparency and communication; (iii) business transformation, citing the successful upgrade to Quantum; (iv) empowered people, noting targeted trainings for personnel; and finally, (v) products, services and processes, noting enhanced procurement monitoring. She UNW/2025/1 6/20 concluded by stating that UN-Women is fully committed to implementing all Board of Auditors recommendations, as the Entity recognizes their importance in enhancing its operations and, ultimately, in delivering gender equality and women\u2019s rights and empowerment. 16.

A joint statement delivered on behalf of a group of countries welcomed the thirteenth consecutive unqualified audit opinion and thanked the UN Board of Auditors for their report. The joint statement recognized UN-Women\u2019s efforts to implement the recommendations of the UN Board of Auditors, highlighting its 92 per cent implementation rate. The group of countries further noted areas of improvement identified by the report, including the allocation of core resources, and encouraged UN-Women to adhere to the Board of Auditor\u2019s recommendations in this regard. In addition, the group of countries encouraged UN-Women to strengthen its assurance activities life cycle by implementing an alert system. The joint statement urged UN-Women to perform monthly reconciliations with UNDP through the interfund cash clearing account to ensure timely payments are made by UNDP on behalf of UN-Women. Furthermore, UN-Women was encouraged to adhere to the recommendations to strengthen the support it gives to country offices to enable them to implement concrete actions that contribute to environmental sustainability. 17. In response, the Deputy Executive Director for Resource Management, Sustainability and Partnerships noted the progress made by UN-Women, highlighting the relative size and maturity of the Entity. The Deputy Executive Director went on to state that UN-Women is prepared to update its core resource allocation methodology ahead of the Executive Board\u2019s annual session 2026. She added that UN-Women is also working on the new integrated budget and internal core resource allocation tool in conjunction with updating its methodology. The Deputy stressed the importance of identifying priorities and opportunities through consultative processes while maintaining flexibility for allocating global funds at the regional level. The Director of the Strategy, Planning, Resources and Effectiveness Division confirmed that UN-Women is on track to update its core resource allocation methodology through reviewing its core resource allocation tool. The Director noted that the Entity is embedding procedures on social and environmental sustainability by building the capacities of staff at all levels through enhanced socialization. This will help personnel understand how to meet social and environmental requirements as part of a holistic approach to performance and planning. The Director of the Management and Administration Division ad interim concluded by stating that for the interfund cash clearing account, UN- Women and UNDP have made significant improvements to the reconciliation payment process and that UN-Women will continue to work with UNDP to further reduce discrepancies and maximize efficiencies in this matter. V. Joint Inspection Unit review of governance and oversight of the Executive Boards of UNDP/UNFPA/UNOPS, UNICEF and UN-Women 18. The President of the Executive Board representing the Western European and Others Group provided an update on the implementation of the assessment of how the Executive Board executes its governance and oversight functions following the Joint Inspection Unit (JIU) report JIU/REP/2023/7 and as mandated by Executive Board Decision 2024/3. She noted that in November UNW/2025/1 7/20 2024, the Bureau of UN-Women\u2019s Executive Board received preliminary comments from the Entity\u2019s management and independent offices on the JIU report which have since been posted online. The President shared that a working group comprised of 15 Member States with cross-board and equal regional representation was approved through a silent agreement procedure on 24 January 2025. She noted that the UN-Women Bureau collaborated with the Bureaux of UNDP/UNFPA/UNOPS and UNICEF to draft the terms of reference for the working group which have been approved by the other Executive Boards during their first regular sessions, and she expressed the hope that the Board of UN-Women would do likewise. The President underscored the importance of this process in ensuring the effectiveness and governance of the Board and the role it has in helping UN-Women deliver on its mandate, while urging Member States to remain committed in advancing shared goals in this regard. 19. After the floor was opened, a group of Member States emphasized the importance of the JIU review for enhancing the governance and oversight of the Executive Boards, with the objective of maximizing the ability of United Nations entities to deliver. The joint statement went on to recognize the importance of making use of lessons learned to make the Executive Boards fit for purpose in the context of changing circumstances regarding the role of multilateralism.",

The joint statement went on to recognize the importance of making use of lessons learned to make the Executive Boards fit for purpose in the context of changing circumstances regarding the role of multilateralism. In addition, the group of countries noted the need to align the JIU review process with the QCPR, which calls on United Nations Sustainable Development Group entities to strengthen their governance and oversight functions. Lastly, the joint statement welcomed the formation of the working group and forthcoming actions. 20. The Deputy Executive Director for Resource Management, Sustainability and Partnerships welcomed the statement made by the group of countries and extended the full support of UN-Women to support and guide the JIU review process to ensure effective governance and oversight of the Executive Board. VI. Organizational culture, anti-discrimination and anti- racism 21. The Under-Secretary-General/Executive Director presented an update to the Executive Board on the steps that UN-Women has taken to improve the Entity\u2019s working culture and to act on the JIU\u2019s recommendations to combat racism and racial discrimination (JIU/NOTE/2022/1/Rev.1) in accordance with Executive Board Decision 2024/6. The Head of the Entity underscored that listening to staff is central to the management approach in UN-Women, listing a range of measures put in place such as counselling services, flexible work arrangements, and conflict-resolution training. In addition, the Head of the Entity emphasized efforts to keep the workplace free from discrimination, harassment and abuse of authority, and said that an Ethics Adviser is now in place to strengthen confidential reporting mechanisms for these areas. Following the JIU recommendations, UN-Women has established a group chaired by both Deputy Executive Directors that focuses on enhancing accountability, investing in training, and reforming the human resources process to ensure fairness. The Head of the Entity concluded by stating that UN-Women is undertaking a transformative shift to decentralize its leadership and further align with local and regional priorities. The goal of this shift is to create a workforce that is better positioned to meet the needs of the people UNW/2025/1 8/20 who the Entity serves, while setting a high standard of ethical practices across the United Nations. 22. A joint statement delivered on behalf of a group of delegations celebrated the occasion of the first-ever stand-alone item on organizational culture during an Executive Board session. The joint statement went on to note that respect and fair treatment of all personnel in UN-Women is important for the effective delivery of its mandate. The joint statement emphasized the vital role that executive leadership has in promoting a healthy organizational culture, and the contributions that the Ombudsman and Staff Council make to guide leadership towards this goal. The group wanted to know how different elements of organizational culture are combined to create a holistic image, as well as what additional methods are used, other than surveys to monitor and measure organizational culture. The group urged UN-Women to collect reliable data on organizational culture to help ensure that all voices within the Entity are heard. In addition, the group wanted to know how system-wide learning on organizational culture is measured and how UN-Women oversight offices collaborate towards this goal. One Member State emphasized its support for the elimination of discrimination within the Entity and for equality of opportunity for all individuals. This delegation stressed its support of a merit- based advancement system as opposed to a preference-based system. Another delegation encouraged UN-Women to develop trainings and courses on anti- racism and unconscious bias, as well as suggesting the inclusion of dedicated budget items to combat racism. Another Member State stressed the importance of data and asked whether UN-Women had undertaken a culture audit by a third party. The Member State asked how the Entity has increased its awareness capacity for disability and LGBTQI+ inclusion and what impact the forthcoming pivot will have on this capacity. In closing, the delegation requested further clarity on the development of an accountability framework and asked for an update on the forthcoming Human Resource Strategy. 23.",

Responding to the points raised by Member States, the Deputy Executive Director for Resource Management, Sustainability and Partnerships recognized the significant underinvestment in the Entity\u2019s human resource function. She explained that UN-Women is currently undertaking a review of the Human Resource Strategy, the results of which will soon be reviewed by management. The outcome of this review will be reflected in the new strategic plan and integrated budget, which will seek to adequately resource the Entity\u2019s human resource function. She emphasized that recruitments, promotions and decisions are firmly based on merit and professional experience while ensuring a balanced global workforce and gender parity. 24. The Director of Human Resources responded to a delegation\u2019s question by stating that the Entity has not done a culture audit but will look at best practices from other United Nations entities to consider moving forward on a culture audit. The Director went on to note that UN-Women has implemented three of the six JIU recommendations, and plans to further update the Executive Board on implementation of the remaining recommendations at the annual session. The Director shared that the Entity actively monitors personnel through a framework of indicators focused on protection from sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment, as outlined in the strategic plan. He added that the Entity relies on support from other entities for the development of training, materials and other initiatives, drawing on best practices throughout the system and UNW/2025/1 9/20 preventing duplication of efforts in these areas. He further shared that the human resource function works closely with the oversight functions of the Entity, as well as the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) and the Ombudsman when needed. The Director concluded by informing the Board that UN-Women will soon begin implementing a new modality for affiliate personnel which will provide enhanced benefits and entitlements. The Deputy Executive Director for Normative Support, UN System Coordination and Programme Results concluded by emphasizing the importance of a healthy organizational culture in delivering on the Entity\u2019s triple mandate in multifaceted and sometimes challenging global contexts. 25. In her statement, the UN-Women Representative to the UNDP, UNFPA, UNOPS and UN-Women Staff Council recognized the lives lost in the ongoing conflict in Gaza, noting that this has been the largest loss of life of United Nations personnel in a conflict or natural disaster. She mentioned the sacrifices of personnel in other conflict areas such as Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ukraine and Haiti, among others. She went on to note efforts made by the Staff Council to strengthen representation and increase capacity-building by establishing the Global Forum of Local Staff and Personnel Associations. Critical personnel issues remain at the heart of Staff Council efforts, such as mental health, career development, and contractual equity, noting that the Council has undertaken strong advocacy work in these fields. These efforts have been able to expand consultations on UN-Women\u2019s ongoing pivot model and a human resource support plan for personnel. She noted that personnel continue to have concerns about the transparency of the pivot process and its impact on the Entity\u2019s effectiveness. In addition, personnel have requested more-detailed reports and opportunities to provide input as the process moves forward. The Staff Council Representative stated that personnel with non-staff contract modalities, as well as those unable to move, need to be handled with fairness and transparency. She concluded by welcoming the human resource support plan for the pivot and thanking management for their attentiveness to the concerns raised by the Staff Council. 26. The Deputy Executive Director for Resource Management, Sustainability and Partnerships thanked the Staff Council for their important work and acknowledged the losses suffered by United Nations personnel during the past year. She stated that UN-Women had engaged in intensive consultations across the Entity before beginning the pivot process.",

She stated that UN-Women had engaged in intensive consultations across the Entity before beginning the pivot process. The Deputy Executive Director noted that there are varying perspectives on the pivot in the Entity, but that UN- Women is committed to supporting its personnel during the process through the human resource support strategy. She concluded by recognizing the importance of implementing the pivot process with maximum fairness and transparency. 27. One Member State took the floor to note that further work is needed from UN-Women to provide details on the pivot, such as a risk assessment and a comprehensive cost\u2013benefit analysis. The delegation encouraged UN- Women to make use of all Executive Board sessions, as well as an informal briefing, to update Member States as the process develops. 28. The Deputy Executive Director for Resource Management, Sustainability and Partnerships responded to the delegation\u2019s comment by confirming that the Entity will continue to provide regular updates to the Executive Board on the pivot process. She reiterated the need for the pivot, noting that sustained funding viability for certain positions will not be able to continue without the pivot. The UNW/2025/1 10/20 Deputy Executive Director for Normative Support, UN System Coordination and Programme Results thanked the Executive Board for its guidance during the pivot process. She went on to note that while transparency is critical, a balance needs to be maintained to protect certain confidentialities. In her reply, the Under-Secretary-General/Executive Director thanked the Staff Council, management and Member States for their remarks during the segment. She emphasized that staff well-being takes top priority in the organization, as does the further implementation of UN-Women\u2019s triple mandate. 29. The Ombudsman for United Nations Funds and Programmes presented his annual report to the Executive Board. He shared that during 2023, his office handled 31 cases pertaining to UN-Women, while in 2024 there had been 52 cases. Some common observations from these cases included a reluctance among UN-Women personnel to engage on the topic of mental health. In addition, there was a fear of reprisals, which constitutes a considerable barrier for conflict resolution. He went on to mention other common types of cases, including discrimination and a perceived lack of respect. He concluded by thanking UN-Women and the Staff Council for their strong collaboration with the Office of the Ombudsman and noted that the office continues to be a confidential space to raise concerns and find ways of addressing them. 30. The Under-Secretary-General/Executive Director welcomed the Ombudsman\u2019s presentation and noted that the increasing number of cases handled by his office is an indication of growing trust placed in it by colleagues. She concluded by thanking the Ombudsman for the ongoing support that his office provides to UN-Women. VII. Risk management 31. The Deputy Executive Director for Resource Management, Sustainability and Partnerships provided an update to the Executive Board on risk management. She noted that risk management practices are central to how UN-Women operates in a global setting in which increasing numbers of women and girls live in conflict-affected circumstances. UN-Women identified five interlinked critical risk areas prevalent in 2025: (i) funding; (ii) economic climate; (iii) global landscape of gender equality; (iv) climate change; and (v) cybersecurity. 32. The Director of Strategy, Planning, Resources and Effectiveness for UN- Women presented to the Executive Board highlights of the Entity\u2019s improving risk maturity and risk areas of strategic importance. She went on to note the high levels of engagement by senior management in risk maturity as shown by their engagement with the Risk Management Committee and a network of 80 global risk focal points. The Director stated that UN-Women has a long-established Risk Management Policy subject to routine review and a clear governance structure around risk management, reflecting thorough integration of risk into the Entity\u2019s operations. She went on to emphasize that the instability of UN- Women\u2019s core resources represents a pertinent risk which UN-Women seeks to mitigate through boosting cost recovery.",

She went on to emphasize that the instability of UN- Women\u2019s core resources represents a pertinent risk which UN-Women seeks to mitigate through boosting cost recovery. The uncertain global environment represents another significant risk that the Entity mitigates through focusing on gender-responsive budgeting. The third risk area of growing political instability is mitigated through active engagement with the IASC and support for multi- stakeholder partnerships. The fourth risk area, cybersecurity, is mitigated UNW/2025/1 11/20 through enhanced cybergovernance and data privacy measures. The final area of risk, climate change, is mitigated through the Entity\u2019s programmatic work. 33. After opening the floor, one Member State speaking on behalf of a group of countries noted the high priority placed on risk management and expressed its appreciation for UN-Women\u2019s efforts to recognize and mitigate risk. The joint statement encouraged UN-Women to use this item at Executive Board sessions to provide a forward-looking risk profile. The group asked several questions, requesting more information on UN-Women\u2019s risk appetite, on how the Entity adapts its risk management approach in fragile and conflict settings, and on how UN-Women collaborates with other entities to share information on risk. Another delegation requested to know what major internal risks the Entity is facing. One further Member State welcomed further updates on the pivot that UN-Women is undertaking as it pertains to risk. 34. The Deputy Executive Director for Resource Management, Sustainability and Partnerships responded to delegations\u2019 questions by stating that unacceptable levels of risk for the Entity are when the level of risk far exceeds any potential results. She added that UN-Women builds its risk management apparatus to be streamlined and efficient, keeping it flexible to respond to emerging risk such as artificial intelligence (AI). The Director of the Strategy, Planning, Resources and Effectiveness Division responded to Member States\u2019 comments by stating that when aggregated, the Entity has a medium risk appetite. However, when disaggregated, UN-Women has a very low risk appetite with regards to fraud, sexual exploitation, and harassment, but a higher risk appetite in conflict or crisis settings. In conflict and crisis settings, UN-Women has a robust security management system which works to identify and mitigate any security-related risks. In addition, the Entity works with partners in fragile contexts to develop capacity and build organizational resilience. Regarding coordination with other United Nations entities, UN-Women engages in system- wide discussions on risk at the country level. UN-Women contributes to the development of the Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework. Through robust reporting on UN-SWAP 3.0 and participation in the Gender Equality Acceleration Plan, UN-Women can increase its role in promoting gender equality in the United Nations system, leveraging its coordination mandate to provide technical support to other entities. On internal risks, the Director noted that underinvestment in the Human Resources Division and maintaining strong internal governance constitute the two most significant potential risks for the Entity. The Director went on to emphasize the importance of strong organizational culture in promoting healthy risk management through dedicated trainings, noting that these take place at the country level. 35. The Enterprise Risk Management Manager shared that for training development, UN-Women works very closely with the Programme Support Management Unit and the Ethics Function, noting that ethics and organizational culture are key aspects of good risk management approaches. On internal risk, the Manager added that UN-Women uses a top-down, bottom-up approach which allows for aggregated and disaggregated data to form a comprehensive picture of the Entity\u2019s risk profile. These data are then reviewed every quarter, the results of which are shared with the Risk Management Committee for reflection on how this affects the strategic objectives of the Entity. 36. Additionally, the Deputy Executive Director for Normative Support, UN System Coordination and Programme Results responded by emphasizing that UNW/2025/1 12/20 risks and issues may be very different in various local contexts.",

In this regard, she noted the importance of UN-Women\u2019s coordination mandate as it pertains to risk management, drawing on lessons learned from other entities. The Deputy Executive Director noted that the current financial environment poses a significant risk to achieving gender equality. In this setting, she noted the need to leverage best practices for gender equality, citing the UN-SWAP and Gender Equality Acceleration Plan as exciting initiatives in this regard. She concluded by assuring Member States that the pivot process will not minimize UN-Women\u2019s normative role at the global level, arguing that it will in fact enhance it. VIII. Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS Programme Coordinating Board meeting 37. In her opening remarks, the Deputy Executive Director presented key updates on the implementation of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) Programme Coordinating Board recommendations. She highlighted UN-Women\u2019s important coordination mandate, noting that UN- Women as a UNAIDS co-sponsoring agency ensures that gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment are prioritized and embedded at the core of the UN system agency efforts so that HIV strategies address the deep-rooted gender inequalities that fuel the epidemic. While she celebrated the groundbreaking scientific advances and other achievements for women and girls in health, particularly on HIV, she noted that persistent challenges require stronger accountability and financing for gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment in the HIV response. For example, she shared how HIV infections among women and girls aged 15 and older had increased in Eastern Europe and Central Asia and the Middle East and North Africa and remained largely unchanged in Latin America. She shared statistics demonstrating the compounded challenges in preventing HIV and accessing treatment. The Deputy Executive Director welcomed the establishment of a high-level panel to revisit the UNAIDS Joint Programme\u2019s operational model given the funding challenges in May 2024. She called on members to ensure that ending gender inequalities and investing in women\u2019s leadership at all levels remain central to the scope of the Joint Programme\u2019s work. She added that UN-Women has been responding and adjusting to the context around resources, but that the Entity is continuing to advance gender-responsive HIV policies and institutions and to support women\u2019s organizations and networks of those living with HIV. She went on to share examples of UN-Women\u2019s contributions to the HIV response across several countries, such as highlighting UN-Women\u2019s support of the Young Women for Life Movement in South Africa. She concluded by underscoring the importance of sustaining options and opportunities for people living with HIV, and highlighted the need to integrate the work on HIV into UN-Women\u2019s next strategic plan. 38. The UNAIDS Deputy Executive Director of the Policy, Advocacy and Knowledge Branch commended UN-Women for its impactful contribution to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS and recognized the Under- Secretary-General/Executive Director for her strong commitment to the programme. She highlighted the multiple forms of stigma and discrimination experienced by women and girls and the regressive social norms that continue to hold women back directly, increasing women\u2019s and girls\u2019 risks of HIV UNW/2025/1 13/20 infection. The Deputy Executive Director of UNAIDS emphasized how UN- Women\u2019s leadership role at the country level in advancing gender equality and advocating for and supporting the leadership of women living with and affected by HIV, particularly adolescent girls and young women, remains central to the success of the HIV response. While discussing the next Global AIDS Strategy 2026\u20132031, she highlighted that UN-Women\u2019s bold and consistent voice, presence and support are necessary for maintaining a focus on eliminating gender inequalities, which will help accelerate progress to achieve shared objectives. She mentioned that the Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS, through the collaborative advocacy and technical strength of its co-sponsors and civil society representatives, has achieved and supported incredible progress and results for people, especially women living with a",

She concluded by noting that ending AIDS requires sufficient resources and that the roles of the Joint Programme and UN-Women remain critical for accelerating action and ensuring all at risk are served. 39. A joint statement delivered on behalf of 19 countries commended UN- Women for its contributions to the United Nations Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS, welcomed gains made in the fight against HIV/AIDS and noted the ongoing need to focus efforts on delivering for women and girls in the context of HIV/AIDS. The group highlighted that women and girls constitute 45 per cent of the total number of HIV infections globally, while noting that many new infections could have been prevented by advancing gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment. They added that widening inequalities and significantly reduced funding constitute important roadblocks in achieving the common goal. The joint statement further argued that enabling legal environments are critical for addressing the inequalities fuelled by the HIV epidemic and that the regression of human rights globally must be urgently addressed. The group expressed support for UNAIDS efforts to work with governments on developing national HIV response sustainability road maps and welcomed the increased collaboration between UN-Women and other UN agencies, based on their comparative advantages. In the context of the challenging HIV funding landscape, the group asked how UN-Women is planning to sustain its work up to and beyond 2030 on the HIV/AIDS agenda. It asked about the lessons that UN- Women learned through implementing its current strategic plan and how these will inform the next strategic plan, as well as about UN-Women\u2019s approach to providing support and technical assistance to countries adversely affected by conflicts and crises. Speaking in a national capacity, one delegation welcomed the continued decline in new HIV and AIDS infections in sub-Saharan Africa and the critical role played by UN-Women in ensuring that gender-responsive strategies remain central to the global HIV and AIDS response. However, despite these achievements, the delegation expressed deep concern that girls and young women continue to bear the disproportionate burden of new infections, making up 85 per cent of new cases in their age group in sub-Saharan Africa. The delegation commended UN-Women\u2019s leadership in supporting Member States to implement policies that prioritize gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, and called for an increase of flexible and predictable funding for UN-Women to ensure the sustainability of its HIV- and AIDS-related programmes. 40. In response to the questions raised, the Deputy Executive Director shared lessons learned and underscored the importance of understanding the causes of transmission and addressing gender inequalities. The Director of the Policy, UNW/2025/1 14/20 Programme and Intergovernmental Division highlighted UN-Women\u2019s approach to responding to HIV and AIDS in its current strategic plan and discussed the funding challenges for co-sponsors of the Joint Programme. The Chief of HIV/AIDS shared that UN-Women is actively involved in the development of the new Global AIDS Strategy, including by convening women\u2019s organizations and networks of women living with HIV, to develop a holistic response. IX. Field visit 41. Speaking on behalf of the joint field visit delegation, the Second Counsellor of Mali reported on the joint field visit of the Executive Boards of UNICEF, UNDP/UNFPA/UNOPS, WFP and UN-Women to Cambodia from 28 October to 1 November 2024. She explained that the purpose of the field visit was to help members of the Executive Boards more effectively understand the extent to which, and the ways in which, United Nations organizations work together and contribute to the achievement of national development plans and SDGs. The delegation expressed its deepest gratitude to the Government of Cambodia for receiving the members of the Executive Boards at the highest level and thanked the coordinating UNFPA country office, supported by the country offices of the other five UN entities, for organizing a very fruitful visit focusing on the ma",

Such a multisectoral child- and adolescent-focused approach contributes both to preventing drug use and reducing other risk behaviours, as well as improving the quality of life and general mental health of children and adolescents, Noting with appreciation the development of tools such as the Review of Prevention Systems, derived from the International Standards on Drug Use Prevention, and their potential for enabling Member States to systematically assess the structure and functioning of their prevention systems, Expressing its appreciation for the launch by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime of the Children Amplified Prevention Services initiative, which is aimed at amplifying the resilience of children from birth to adolescence and preventing the use of drugs and other psychoactive substances and encourages Member States to adopt systems of prevention aimed at children and adolescents, 1.

Encourages Member States to assess and map out their national prevention systems, engaging all stakeholders through a systematic and multisectoral approach using, when appropriate, as a tool the International Standards on Drug Use Prevention and identifying local and regional evidence-based good practices to be evaluated and disseminated; E/2025/28 E/CN.7/2025/11 5 4. Invites Member States to strengthen partnerships with civil society, people affected by drug use, youth-led organizations, health and social service professionals, academia, educators, law enforcement entities and other relevant stakeholders, as appropriate, to fully realize comprehensive systems of prevention in order to align national efforts aimed at delivering extensive scientific evidence-based drug prevention services, fostering collaborative efforts that utilize the strengths and expertise of each sector to effectively address diverse needs and build resilience and protective environments against drug use, using as a tool, when appropriate, the International Standards on Drug Use Prevention; 5. Also invites Member States to enhance international cooperation and information exchange by promoting the sharing of experiences and best practices in the field of drug use prevention for children and adolescents; 6. Encourages Member States, in cooperation with universities and other research institutions, as well as civil society, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the World Health Organization and other relevant United Nations entities, and international organizations and programmes, in accordance with their mandates and national legislation, to develop and implement scientific research on the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and return on investment of their prevention systems; 7.",

Several speakers commended UNODC on the implementation of the UNODC Strategy 2021\u20132025 and expressed their views on the formulation of a new strategy for the period 2026\u20132030. 17. Some speakers recognized the challenges in addressing and countering the world drug problem and commended UNODC on its work in supporting Member States\u2019 efforts to implement all international drug policies and providing technical assistance to strengthen national capacities in a broad range of drug-related areas. Reference was made to the Office\u2019s research work, including the publication of the World Drug Report 2023, its youth initiatives and its capacity-building efforts in the field; the need for a comprehensive approach to the Office\u2019s research work was highlighted. UNODC was encouraged by some speakers to further mainstream gender and age perspectives into drug-related policies and programmes. The Office was also E/2025/28 E/CN.7/2025/11 28 called upon to intensify its efforts in strengthening results-based management, monitoring, reporting and evaluation to assess the impacts and effectiveness of its programmes in order to ensure accountability. 18. Many speakers recognized the standing open-ended intergovernmental working group on improving the governance and financial situation of UNODC as an important forum for dialogue between Member States and the Office and for enhancing governance and strengthening accountability and transparency. 19. Concern was expressed regarding the ongoing liquidity crisis of the regular budget of the United Nations, which adversely impacted the Office\u2019s financial stability and compromised its ability to effectively fulfil its mandates, including supporting the intergovernmental work of the Commission, as exemplified by the cancellation of the meetings of the subsidiary bodies of the Commission in 2024 and the lack of interpretation services for mandated intergovernmental meetings of that Commission. Some speakers mentioned that, despite the financial crisis, the implementation of mandates and support to Member States should not be subjected to limitations. 20. Other challenging financial constraints of the Office, including the decrease in the general-purpose funds and the dependence on extrabudgetary resources, were noted with concern. Concerns were also raised with regard to the percentage accounted for by programme support costs. The Office was invited to diversify its donor base and foster broader stakeholder engagement, and it was commended for its work on United Nations system-wide inter-agency cooperation to maximize available resources for a more comprehensive and effective response to the world drug problem. Member States were encouraged to provide UNODC with adequate, predictable, flexible, sustainable and unearmarked resources to fully implement its mandates. 21. Many speakers welcomed the efforts of UNODC to improve gender parity and geographical representation among its staff and urged the Office to make further efforts in that regard. At the same time, it was emphasized that the basis for candidate selection should be merit and competence, while due regard should also be paid to the importance of recruiting staff on as wide a geographical basis as possible, in line with article 101 of the Charter of the United Nations. 22. One delegate stated that her country defined the term \u201cgender\u201d in line with article 7, paragraph 3, of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and referred to her country\u2019s sustained commitment to protecting women\u2019s rights without generating inequities that it considered to go against the principle of non-discrimination. B. Action taken by the Commission 23. At its 3rd meeting, on 11 March 2025, the Commission endorsed the nomination of Magdi Ahmed Mofadal Elnour (Sudan) and Mostafa Shafizadeh (Islamic Republic of Iran) as Vice-Chairs of the standing open-ended intergovernmental working group on improving the governance and financial situation of UNODC for 2025.

      "text": "to abuse and produced ill effects similar to those of other opioids that were controlled under Schedule I of the 1961 Convention as amended, as there was evidence that its use caused substantial harm, including death, and as it had no known therapeutic use, WHO recommended that N-desethyl isotonitazene, also referred to as norisotonitazene, be added to Schedule I of the 1961 Convention as amended. (e) Consideration of a proposal from the World Health Organization to place hexahydrocannabinol in Schedule II of the 1971 Convention 35. The observer for WHO informed the Commission that hexahydrocannabinol, also known as HHC, was a semi-synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonist that had been described as a colourless viscous oil or resin. Hexahydrocannabinol-containing products included low-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) cannabis flowers and resins infused or sprayed with the substance, e-liquids and cartridges for electronic cigarettes, edible products such as gummies and marshmallows, tinctures resembling dietary supplements and distillate oils. The routes of administration included inhalation, oral and sublingual. Hexahydrocannabinol had been analytically confirmed in people driving under the influence of drugs and in clinical admissions for drug intoxication in adults and children in multiple countries, including cases in which hexahydrocannabinol was confirmed to be the only substance involved. Seizures of hexahydrocannabinol had been reported in many countries in a number of regions. The observer informed the Commission that, as hexahydrocannabinol had a mechanism of action and effects similar to those of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, which was controlled under Schedule II of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971, and as there was sufficient evidence that hexahydrocannabinol was used in such a way as to constitute a public health and social problem, warranting placement under international control, WHO recommended that hexahydrocannabinol be added to Schedule II of the 1971 Convention. (f) Consideration of a proposal from the World Health Organization to place carisoprodol in Schedule IV of the 1971 Convention 36. The observer for WHO informed the Commission that carisoprodol was a centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxant sold as a single-ingredient preparation and in combination products. It was available as a pharmaceutical product in tablet form, had been detected in falsified pharmaceuticals and was also found as a white powder. Fatal and non-fatal intoxications and cases of driving while under the influence of carisoprodol, either alone or in combination with other substances, had been observed. Non-medical use of carisoprodol was widely documented in multiple countries and regions, including in combination with opioids and benzodiazepines. Increased restrictions on the prescription of carisoprodol or removal of the drug from the market in several countries had led to decreased incidences of poisoning and other types of public health harm. Seizures of carisoprodol had been reported in many countries in several regions. There was increasing evidence that non-medical use of carisoprodol in a number of countries constituted a significant risk to public health. The observer informed the Commission that, as carisoprodol was a medicine that had been shown to produce a state of dependence, central nervous system depression and ill effects similar to those of other substances that were listed under Schedule IV of E/2025/28 E/CN.7/2025/11 32 the 1971 Convention, WHO recommended that carisoprodol be added to Schedule IV of the 1971 Convention. (g) Consideration of a proposal from the International Narcotics Control Board to move 3,4-MDP-2-P methyl glycidate (\u201cPMK glycidate\u201d) from the body of Table I of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988 to footnote 1 to that table, as the \u201cmethyl ester\u201d, so that it appears together with the other seven esters of 3,4-MDP-2-P methyl glycidic acid 37. The President of INCB reminded the Commission that on 4 September 2024 he had informed the Chair of the Commission of a proposal to move the methyl ester of 3,4-MDP-2-P methyl glycidic acid from the body of Table I of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988 to the footnote introduced pursuant to Commission decision 67/25 of 19 March 2024. That proposal followed on the Board\u2019s observation of an inconsistency with regard to the manner in which the esters of 3,4-MDP-2-P methyl glycidic acid were presented in Table I of the Convention.",

That proposal followed on the Board\u2019s observation of an inconsistency with regard to the manner in which the esters of 3,4-MDP-2-P methyl glycidic acid were presented in Table I of the Convention. Specifically, while seven esters of 3,4-MDP-2-P methyl glycidic acid had been included in a footnote to Table I of the Convention in accordance with Commission decision 67/25, the methyl ester, which had been added to Table I of the Convention in November 2019, was still included in the body of that table as 3,4-MDP-2-P methyl glycidate (\u201cPMK glycidate\u201d). The Board therefore proposed to the Commission that the methyl ester be removed from the body of Table I of the 1988 Convention and instead be included (as the \u201cmethyl ester\u201d) in the same footnote. 38. Under the same item, some speakers urged WHO to consider undertaking an evaluation of further substances, such as tramadol, ketamine and veterinary medicines such as xylazine. Some speakers also reported on their national efforts to control such substances even though they had not been placed under international control. 2. Challenges and future work of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs, the World Health Organization and the International Narcotics Control Board in the review of substances for possible scheduling recommendations 39. Many speakers expressed concern regarding the continued proliferation of synthetic drugs, new psychoactive substances, in particular synthetic opioids, and precursor chemicals, and emphasized the need to keep pace with the rapid changes in the drug market. The challenges posed by innovations in emerging substances and in the use of non-scheduled precursors for the illicit manufacture of drugs were highlighted. Some speakers mentioned innovative national responses, including the adaptation of their national legislation using approaches involving temporary scheduling and the scheduling of substances, including precursors, by class. 40. Some speakers highlighted the need for capacity-building, including on the analysis and identification of emerging drugs. The importance of monitoring, and the critical role of early warning in responding to, emerging threats, as well as promoting the exchange of data and best practices in that regard, were highlighted. The importance of international scheduling was mentioned, and support was expressed for the treaty-mandated roles of the Commission, INCB and WHO in the continuing efforts to schedule harmful substances and precursor chemicals. Reference was made to the recommendation of INCB to schedule groups of related chemicals so as to allow regulatory controls to outpace the activities of criminal networks. 41. Some speakers shared information on national supply and demand reduction strategies and highlighted that a comprehensive and balanced approach should be used to address the synthetic drug problem. Other proposed approaches included establishing public-private partnerships between customs and law enforcement authorities and courier services, online platforms and industry operators to enable them to share information and data on non-scheduled precursor chemicals and E/2025/28 E/CN.7/2025/11 33 substances, protect the integrity of supply chains and improve detection and interception efforts. 3. International Narcotics Control Board 42. Several speakers expressed support and appreciation for the work of INCB and welcomed its annual report for 2024. They also reiterated their commitment to the international drug control conventions and expressed appreciation for the Board\u2019s efforts to support Member States in carrying out their treaty obligations. Some speakers highlighted the work of INCB in the area of synthetic drugs and welcomed the focus of the thematic chapter of the Board\u2019s annual report for 2024 on possible responses to the rapid expansion of illicit synthetic drug manufacture. The support provided to countries in preventing the manufacture, trafficking and consumption of new psychoactive substances through the use of real-time communication tools by law enforcement officers was welcomed by some speakers. 43. Many speakers expressed appreciation for the INCB annual report for 2024, as it was an important tool for guiding Member States in their drug control treaty- mandated actions. Some speakers also made reference to the continued focus of INCB on human rights in its annual report and to the complementarity of the drug conventions and human rights instruments highlighted in it.",

Some speakers also made reference to the continued focus of INCB on human rights in its annual report and to the complementarity of the drug conventions and human rights instruments highlighted in it. One speaker suggested that the report should also address challenges that the international drug control system is facing and not focus exclusively on the achievements of the system. The speaker further expressed appreciation that the report provided information on the impact that illicit drug trafficking and production had on the environment. 44. Some speakers made reference to the proactive scheduling of 16 designer precursors of amphetamine-type stimulants in 2024 as a good approach to ensuring more effective and timely scheduling. The work of INCB to raise awareness among competent authorities of the tools available for the effective control and monitoring of drug precursors was commended. 45. The recommendation by INCB that Member States prioritize the submission of accurate and timely reports was welcomed, as reliable and comprehensive data were the basis for the work of INCB and for the efforts of Member States to develop effective, evidence-based drug policies. Some speakers highlighted the importance of the independent role of INCB in the evaluation of chemical precursors for possible scheduling. 4. International cooperation to ensure the availability of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances for medical and scientific purposes while preventing their diversion 46. The importance of ensuring adequate availability of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances for medical and scientific purposes was highlighted by several speakers, and the work carried out by INCB, WHO, UNODC and the Commission was recognized. The essential role of medicines containing internationally controlled substances \u2013 both narcotics and psychotropics \u2013 in treating mental health illnesses, drug use disorders and neurological conditions was also highlighted, as were concerns about their diversion and non-medical use. 47. The affordability of controlled substances for medical purposes was underscored by one speaker, who stressed as well the importance of engaging various stakeholders in efforts in that regard. Several speakers emphasized the need to ensure that safeguarding measures did not lead to scarcity, inaccessibility or compromises in quality, safety and efficacy. 48. Some speakers shared information on the major barriers and impediments to access and availability and the measures taken at the national level to address them. The issue of diversion was also mentioned by several speakers. Speakers drew attention to the relevance of having resilient pharmaceutical industries, using digital tools for supply chain effectiveness and employing traceability methods to mitigate E/2025/28 E/CN.7/2025/11 34 the risks of diversion to illicit markets, and they expressed concern over substandard and falsified medical products. 49. Some speakers underlined the need to consider the issue of access to and availability of controlled substances for the treatment of drug use disorders, including the development of new long-acting substances that were not at risk of diversion. Guidance was requested from UNODC and WHO on the use of long-acting medication for the treatment of opioid use disorders. Examples of national policies to address the problem were provided, with the focus being on legal instruments, national manufacturing and the training of health professionals. 50. Concern was expressed about the lack of adequate access to medications during armed conflicts, epidemics and natural disasters. The need to facilitate the import and export of controlled substances was mentioned in relation to the International Import and Export Authorization System (I2ES). 51. Calling for regional cooperation and balanced approaches, some speakers urged countries to step up support for developing countries by providing technical assistance and capacity-building to improve regulatory and distribution systems. 5. Other matters arising from the international drug control treaties 52. The increasing levels of both demand for and supply of controlled substances at the global level were highlighted and the need for comprehensive and integrated drug policies was underlined. 53.",

B. Action taken by the Commission 54. At its 5th meeting, on 12 March 2025, the Commission decided by 49 votes to none, with no abstentions, to include N-pyrrolidino protonitazene in Schedule I of the 1961 Convention as amended. (For the text of the decision, see chap. I, sect. B, decision 68/1.) 55. At the same meeting, the Commission decided by 50 votes to none, with no abstentions, to include N-pyrrolidino metonitazene in Schedule I of the 1961 Convention as amended. (For the text of the decision, see chap. I, sect. B, decision 68/2.) 56. At the same meeting, the Commission decided by 50 votes to none, with no abstentions, to include etonitazepipne in Schedule I of the 1961 Convention as amended. (For the text of the decision, see chap. I, sect. B, decision 68/3.) 57. At the same meeting, the Commission decided by 50 votes to none, with no abstentions, to include N-desethyl isotonitazene in Schedule I of the 1961 Convention as amended. (For the text of the decision, see chap. I, sect. B, decision 68/4.) 58. At the same meeting, the Commission decided by 49 votes to none, with one abstention, to include hexahydrocannabinol in Schedule II of the 1971 Convention. (For the text of the decision, see chap. I, sect. B, decision 68/5.) 59. At the same meeting, the Commission decided by 48 votes to none, with two abstentions, to include carisoprodol in Schedule IV of the 1971 Convention. (For the text of the decision, see chap. I, sect. B, decision 68/6.) 60. At the same meeting, the Commission decided by consensus to move 3,4-MDP-2-P methyl glycidate (\u201cPMK glycidate\u201d) from the body of Table I of the E/2025/28 E/CN.7/2025/11 35 1988 Convention to footnote 1 to that table, as the \u201cmethyl ester\u201d. (For the text of the decision, see chap. I, sect. B, decision 68/7.) 61. Statements in explanation of vote were made by the representatives of Brazil, the United States and Indonesia. 62. The representative of Brazil expressed a preference for postponing the vote on placing carisoprodol in Schedule IV of the 1971 Convention as he considered further impact studies to be necessary. He highlighted that the substance was not currently controlled in Brazil and there had been no significant reports of abusive use in the country. The possible inclusion in Schedule IV would require several administrative adjustments in the regulated sectors and in order for the national health surveillance agents to be able to comply with the Convention\u2019s control requirements. As the inclusion of the substance could lead to administrative and economic impacts, Brazil was of the view that it was important to assess the potential impacts before any decision on listing the substance was taken. 63. The representative of the United States said that his country supported the use of the international scheduling system to make scientifically informed decisions about international drug control, however he was unable to vote on the proposals to place hexahydrocannabinol in Schedule II of the 1971 Convention and to place carisoprodol in Schedule IV of the 1971 Convention. He noted that, nevertheless, both substances were already controlled in the United States at levels that would allow the country to meet its international obligations arising from the decisions of the Commission. 64. The representative of Indonesia expressed her country\u2019s support for the inclusion of the substances in Schedule I of the 1961 Convention as amended, as voted on. With respect to the 1971 Convention, Indonesia supported adding hexahydrocannabinol to Schedule II and carisoprodol to Schedule IV. Regarding carisoprodol, Indonesia had already implemented strict control measures that classified it as a Schedule I narcotic. The effectiveness of that measure had been demonstrated through successful enforcement actions by the National Narcotics Board in 2024.",

Regarding carisoprodol, Indonesia had already implemented strict control measures that classified it as a Schedule I narcotic. The effectiveness of that measure had been demonstrated through successful enforcement actions by the National Narcotics Board in 2024. Regarding the 1988 Convention, Indonesia supported the technical amendment to remove the methyl ester from Table I and to include it in the corresponding footnote alongside the seven other esters. That adjustment would enhance the clarity of international control measures, while maintaining comprehensive coverage of the substances. She reaffirmed that Indonesia remained committed to strengthening international cooperation in addressing the world drug problem and supporting evidence-based scheduling decisions that protected public health and safety. 65. At its 9th meeting, on 14 March 2025, the Commission took action on a revised draft resolution entitled \u201cStrengthening the international drug control system: a path to effective implementation\u201d (E/CN.7/2025/L.6/Rev.1) as amended by document E/CN.7/2025/L.10, sponsored by Belgium, Brazil, Colombia, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Ecuador, Honduras, Netherlands (Kingdom of the), Norway, Portugal, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Uruguay. (For the text of the resolution, see chap. I, sect. B, resolution 68/6.) 66. The representative of Colombia, noting that the amendments contained in document E/CN.7/2025/L.10 had been proposed after those contained in document E/CN.7/2025/L.9 had been proposed, requested that the Commission first take up consideration of the amendments contained in document E/CN.7/2025/L.10. The representative of the United States, however, disagreed and requested that consideration of the amendments contained in document E/CN.7/2025/L.9 be taken up first. The representatives of Mexico, the Russian Federation and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire made statements. The Chair informed the Commission that the matter raised complex questions of procedure, and that, after careful consideration of the rules of procedure of the functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council and the amendments contained in documents E/CN.7/2025/L.9 and E/CN.7/2025/L.10, in his assessment, the amendments contained in document E/CN.7/2025/L.9 were the furthest removed in substance from the contents of the original revised draft resolution. Accordingly, the Chair was of the view that the Commission was to first E/2025/28 E/CN.7/2025/11 36 consider the amendments contained in document E/CN.7/2025/L.9. In the case that the amendments contained in document E/CN.7/2025/L.9 were not adopted, the Commission would immediately consider the amendments contained in document E/CN.7/2025/L.10. The representative of Colombia disagreed with the Chair\u2019s ruling and requested that it be reconsidered, expressing the view that, as the amendments contained in document E/CN.7/2025/L.10 had been submitted subsequently, they should therefore be decided upon first. At that stage, the representative of Brazil moved for a vote on the Chair\u2019s ruling. The Commission rejected that motion by a vote of 20 against to10 in favour, with 20 abstentions, thereby confirming the ruling by the Chair that the Commission should first consider the amendments contained in document E/CN.7/2025/L.9. The representative of Brazil made a statement. The representatives of Mexico, Canada and the United Kingdom made statements in explanation of vote. 67. The representative of the United States then introduced the amendments contained in document E/CN.7/2025/L.9. The representative of Colombia subsequently requested a vote on those amendments. The Commission rejected the amendments contained in document E/CN.7/2025/L.9 by a vote of 25 against to 12 in favour, with 14 abstentions. 68. The representative of Colombia then introduced the amendments contained in document E/CN.7/2025/L.10. The representative of the United States subsequently requested a vote on those amendments. The Commission adopted the amendments contained in document E/CN.7/2025/L.10 by a vote of 31 in favour to 8 against, with 13 abstentions. 69. At its 10th meeting, on 14 March 2025, the Commission adopted revised draft resolution E/CN.7/2025/L.6/Rev.1 as amended by document E/CN.7/2025/L.10 by a vote of 30 in favour to 3 against, with 18 abstentions. 70.

Upon adoption of the draft resolution as amended, the representative of Colombia and the observer for Egypt made statements. Statements in explanation of vote were made by the representatives of the United States, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, China and the Russian Federation. 71. The representative of the United States stated that his country believed that the revised draft resolution, even as amended, had not been ripe for a decision by the Commission on that day, and that, like many of those who had voted against or had abstained from voting on that revised draft resolution as amended, the United States had many questions about the matter, including with regard to how the resolution could even be implemented; how INCB would, within its treaty-mandated role, appoint independent experts to participate in the panel to be established in accordance with the resolution; whether the sponsor of the revised draft resolution had asked INCB that question; how Member States would nominate experts who would act in their personal capacity only; how the five regional groups of Member States would consider those nominations; how the Commission would appoint a Co-Chair of the panel; whether that appointment would require an election by the Commission; how often the panel would meet; how the Secretariat would prepare a budget estimate when it was not known how often the panel would meet; and whether the sponsor of the revised draft resolution had asked UNODC the latter question. He also asked, in the light of the liquidity crisis of the United Nations and the budget constraints within UNODC, how much that effort would cost, and whether non-governmental groups with political agendas would be able to fund and drive that effort from outside, with disregard for the Commission\u2019s role. He stated that it was unfortunate that the final text of the resolution as adopted by the Commission had left all those questions unanswered, and that his assumption was that the Commission would need to meet again in the future to determine the answers to those questions. He indicated that the United States had called for a vote on the revised draft resolution as amended, and had voted against it because the United States believed that any discussions on strengthening the international drug control framework should remain within the Commission, the United Nations body that had been established for the very purpose E/2025/28 E/CN.7/2025/11 37 of addressing that issue, and that a high-level examination led by panel members selected by the Secretary-General, INCB and WHO would unnecessarily shift the debate beyond Vienna, introducing a more politicized process that would undermine the technical approach of the Commission. Lastly, he noted that, while the United States recognized the need to improve drug control efforts, it would remain convinced that the Commission was the appropriate forum for such discussions, as the Commission would ensure that reforms were guided by expertise rather than political dynamics. 72. The representative of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire stressed that his country aligned itself with the resolution and subscribed to everything contained in it. He welcomed what in his view was a very good analysis of the situation. In terms of harm reduction, he emphasized the need to have a clearer vision and a better analysis of the situation. 73. The representative of China stated that her delegation had been actively, responsibly and constructively participating in the consultations on the revised draft resolution submitted by Colombia and had clearly put forward the views of China on the establishment of the panel requested in it. She noted that, in the course of their consultations, Colombia, as the lead sponsor of the revised draft resolution, had held conversations with representatives of Member States, including China, on the above- mentioned issues, and that States supporting the respective sides of the debate had made efforts to move towards a common position. She stated, however, that, regrettably, the wording of the resolution as adopted regarding the composition of the panel failed to address the concerns of China, as could be seen by the vote on the revised draft resolution submitted by Colombia and the amendments thereto proposed by the United States and Colombia, respectively, as significant differences remained among States members of the",

      "text": "tions with representatives of Member States, including China, on the above- mentioned issues, and that States supporting the respective sides of the debate had made efforts to move towards a common position. She stated, however, that, regrettably, the wording of the resolution as adopted regarding the composition of the panel failed to address the concerns of China, as could be seen by the vote on the revised draft resolution submitted by Colombia and the amendments thereto proposed by the United States and Colombia, respectively, as significant differences remained among States members of the Commission on a range of issues that had not been properly resolved. She explained that China had therefore abstained from voting on the resolution as a whole. She also noted that China maintained that the panel to be established pursuant to the resolution should carry out its work in strict accordance with the mandates of the Commission, and that the panel should, in accordance with the principles of equality, mutual respect and genuine multilateralism, formulate recommendations for the consideration of the Commission that were generally acceptable to all parties and that would have the broad support of the members of the Commission. She expressed the hope that the above-mentioned efforts would contribute to the effective strengthening of the international drug control system based on the three drug control conventions, effectively promote the work of the Commission and strengthen the status and role of the Commission as the main policymaking body within the United Nations system for global drug-related matters. 74. The representative of the Russian Federation stated that her country had voted against the amendments contained in document E/CN.7/2025/L.10 and against revised draft resolution E/CN.7/2025/L.6/Rev.1 as amended because, in the view of her delegation, the adoption of that revised draft resolution as amended would have a detrimental impact on the authority of the international drug control system based on the three drug control conventions and would undermine the authority of the Commission. She noted that, at the same time, the Russian Federation was deeply disappointed that all of the draft resolutions submitted to the Commission at its current session had been put to a vote, noting that the Vienna spirit of consensus had \u201cflown out through the walls of the room\u201d, and that that was a source of great disappointment. She expressed the hope that, in future discussions, the consensual approach to decision-making would prevail on the basis of the common and shared responsibility for combating the world drug problem. E/2025/28 E/CN.7/2025/11 38 Chapter V Follow-up to the implementation at the national, regional and international levels of all commitments, as reflected in the Ministerial Declaration of 2019, to address and counter the world drug problem 75. At its 5th and 6th meetings, on 12 March 2025, and 7th meeting, on 13 March 2025, the Commission considered agenda item 6, entitled \u201cFollow-up to the implementation at the national, regional and international levels of all commitments, as reflected in the Ministerial Declaration of 2019, to address and counter the world drug problem\u201d. 76. For its consideration of item 6, the Commission had before it the following: (a) Report of the Executive Director on the activities of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (E/CN.7/2025/2-E/CN.15/2025/2); (b) Report of the Secretariat on the world situation with regard to drug abuse (E/CN.7/2025/5); (c) Conference room paper containing the Chair\u2019s summary on the thematic discussions on the implementation of all international drug policy commitments, following up to the Ministerial Declaration of 2019 and the 2024 midterm review by the Commission on Narcotic Drugs, following up to the Ministerial Declaration (E/CN.7/2025/CRP.1); (d) Conference room paper containing a note by the Secretariat on the follow- up by the Commission on Narcotic Drugs to the implementation of all international drug policy commitments (E/CN.7/2025/CRP.3). 77. Introductory statements were made by a representative of the secretariat of the Commission and by the Chief of the Drugs, Laboratory and Scientific Services Branch and the Chief of the Research and Trend Analysis Branch of UNODC. In addition, representatives of the Youth Forum, the UNODC-WHO Informal Scientific Network and the UNODC Young Doctors Network, and participants in the consultation between the International AIDS Society, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), WHO and UNODC on strategies to eliminate hepatitis B and C briefed the Commission on the outcome of their consultations held on the margins of the session. 78.",

Many speakers reaffirmed the commitment of their countries to the effective implementation of the international drug policy commitments as recalled in the high- level declaration by the Commission on the 2024 midterm review, following up to the Ministerial Declaration of 2019, and emphasized the importance of upholding those commitments in full conformity with the international drug control conventions, the Charter of the United Nations and other international instruments, including international human rights instruments. Many speakers recalled the central role of the Commission as the principal policymaking body of the United Nations with prime responsibility for drug control matters, and that the three international drug control conventions, together with other relevant international instruments, continued to constitute the cornerstone of the international drug control system. A group of speakers underscored the role of INCB in monitoring Member States\u2019 compliance with their obligations under the three international drug control conventions. In response, one speaker noted that the primary function of INCB was to assist States in implementing the conventions rather than acting as a compliance-monitoring body. 85. A group of speakers highlighted that the flexibility of the drug control conventions enabled Member States to implement national drug policies that reflected their unique contexts while limiting drug use strictly to medical and scientific purposes. That group of speakers emphasized the sovereign right to tailor drug policies to national circumstances and rejected the idea that there is a one-size-fits- all approach, cautioning against an exclusive focus on harm reduction measures as a policy response to address the drug problem. Furthermore, speakers expressed concern over the legalization of cannabis for non-medical use, urging all Member States to comply with their treaty obligations. 86. Several speakers called for human rights-based, people-centred approaches that addressed the root causes of drug production and trafficking. Some speakers emphasized that efforts to fulfil all international drug policy commitments should be aligned with the goals and objectives of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. 87.

Speakers provided updates on the implementation of their commitments under the \u201cPledge4Action\u201d initiative across all key areas. The continued focus on thematic discussions under the Commission\u2019s new workplan for the period 2024\u20132028 was welcomed by many speakers as an opportunity to address the implementation of all international drug policy commitments and respond to evolving drug-related challenges and other substantive matters. 88. A range of persistent and emerging challenges in implementing drug policies were highlighted by a number of speakers; they emphasized the evolving nature of the global drug threats. Those threats included the increasing proliferation and use of synthetic drugs, in particular synthetic opioids and cathinones, the shift of drug distribution to online platforms and the use of modern technologies for drug-related crimes. Concerns were also raised about the non-medical use of controlled medicines, the continued threat of new psychoactive substances, the risks associated with methamphetamine use, the emergence of new trafficking routes, the gaps in access to treatment and the environmental and societal impacts of illicit drug markets. An example was shared illustrating the growing challenge posed by money-laundering facilitated by modern technologies, which enabled anonymous transactions and the cross-border movement of illicit funds, thereby complicating efforts to track and disrupt drug-related financial flows. Speakers stressed the need for, inter alia, adaptive policy measures, technological innovations, stronger international cooperation, strengthened forensic capacities, and improved data collection to ensure evidence-based policymaking. The rising trend of polydrug use was identified as a challenge to traditional treatment interventions, and in that regard several speakers underscored the importance of enhanced health responses to address the consequences of synthetic drug use, in particular opioid overdoses, as well as stricter control over precursor chemicals. Concerns were also expressed about the impact of drug trafficking and organized crime on institutional stability and public security. 89. Many speakers emphasized the need for a balanced, integrated, multidisciplinary and evidence-based approach, highlighting national initiatives relating to legislation, policy development, institutional strengthening and capacity-building. Several speakers reiterated their commitment to zero-tolerance approaches to drug trafficking and the non-medical use of controlled substances, advocating for a world free from drug abuse. Several speakers underscored the importance of continuous evaluation as a means to assess the effectiveness of national policies and facilitate the exchange of best practices at the international level. The critical role of reliable data on different drug indicators in ensuring the effective implementation and assessment of drug policies was also highlighted, and emphasis was placed on the need for accurate, transparent and timely collection, analysis and sharing of data. 90.",

The critical role of reliable data on different drug indicators in ensuring the effective implementation and assessment of drug policies was also highlighted, and emphasis was placed on the need for accurate, transparent and timely collection, analysis and sharing of data. 90. Many speakers shared insights on national demand reduction efforts, highlighting initiatives in the areas of prevention, treatment, care, recovery, rehabilitation and social reintegration, as well as measures aimed at minimizing the public health and social consequences of drug abuse, referred to by many as harm reduction interventions. 91. Many speakers highlighted prevention, in particular early prevention, as a fundamental pillar of drug policies, and a strong focus was placed on national initiatives aimed at reducing the initiation of drug use and the progression to harmful patterns of drug use and drug use disorders. Many speakers shared examples of balanced approaches that integrated prevention and enforcement. Those initiatives, implemented in collaboration with municipalities, judicial partners and youth organizations, were presented as key elements of strategies to prevent the engagement of children and youth in crime. 92. The expansion of evidence-based prevention services was a recurring theme, and several speakers shared information on initiatives focused on supporting E/2025/28 E/CN.7/2025/11 41 individuals, families and communities. Capacity-building programmes to enhance the capacities of the prevention workforce and strengthen quality assurance in the implementation of prevention strategies were also highlighted. Several speakers shared examples of successful outcomes of school-based programmes and the successful integration of prevention curricula, social media campaigns, media outreach efforts and public events, whereby young people and the general public had been effectively engaged in raising awareness of drug-related risks and consequences. Some speakers reported that implementing comprehensive drug demand reduction strategies had led to a better understanding of drug use disorders and had increased community engagement, as well as public interest in addiction-related expertise and certification. A number of speakers welcomed UNODC initiatives such as the Children Amplified Prevention Services (CHAMPS) initiative, which supported comprehensive prevention systems to strengthen the resilience of children. 93. Several speakers emphasized the need for accessible, high-quality treatment and rehabilitation as a key component of drug policies. Reference was made to national efforts focused on expanding evidence-based treatment, aftercare and community- based services, including targeted interventions for children and women, aligned with international standards. Some speakers highlighted efforts aimed at integrating psychosocial and medical interventions in order to provide comprehensive treatment and rehabilitation, while also ensuring the availability of those interventions in prison settings. Speakers highlighted the establishment of rehabilitation centres, including specialized facilities for children, as well as investments in capacity-building through specialized training and knowledge exchange to enhance professional expertise. Some speakers referred to comprehensive national initiatives to prevent the transmission of HIV, viral hepatitis and other infections associated with the use of drugs. Investments in evaluation, research and technology-driven interventions, including artificial intelligence-based tools and digital treatments, were also highlighted as factors contributing to more effective approaches to prevention and treatment. 94. A number of speakers reported on investments in vocational and skills development programmes, as well as partnerships with civil society organizations engaged in prevention and treatment services, as means to promote long-term recovery. 95. A number of speakers emphasized that international cooperation was essential to preventing the diversion of controlled drugs while ensuring their availability for medical and scientific purposes. Speakers highlighted the importance of sharing information on domestic regulatory frameworks and facilitating access to narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances for legitimate use while preventing their misuse and trafficking. In that context, several examples were shared, including with regard to the need for national policies and laws to remain adaptable to the evolving nature of drug markets and associated public health risks.",

In that context, several examples were shared, including with regard to the need for national policies and laws to remain adaptable to the evolving nature of drug markets and associated public health risks. In addition, the harmonization of national lists of controlled substances was highlighted as a way to prevent criminal networks from exploiting regulatory discrepancies among jurisdictions. A number of speakers shared information on national initiatives related to the control of precursors and chemicals that were aimed at strengthening monitoring and regulation efforts in order to prevent the diversion of precursors and chemicals for illicit purposes. 96. Many speakers highlighted challenges encountered in supply reduction efforts, including the continued diversification of drug markets and the proliferation of synthetic opioids and cathinones, which posed significant risks to public health and security. Many speakers shared information on successful investigations, drug seizures and actions leading to the dismantling of organized criminal groups, including statistics on drug seizures. Some speakers detailed successful law enforcement operations, joint enforcement operations, expanded exchanges of intelligence and strengthened bilateral and regional partnerships to address illicit drug flows, which in some cases had resulted in significant seizures of controlled substances. A number of speakers highlighted ongoing efforts to enhance drug enforcement activities, including through the integration of advanced detection technologies, intelligence-sharing mechanisms and inter-agency collaboration, as E/2025/28 E/CN.7/2025/11 42 well as by strengthening the enforcement of customs laws and regulations at key entry points and deploying high-performance scanning equipment and specialized enforcement units to counter increasingly sophisticated smuggling methods. With regard to addressing money-laundering facilitated by modern technologies, speakers reported on national measures such as financial intelligence-related collaboration, banking surveillance and literacy programmes. 97. Other reported interventions focused on how to address the links between drug- related offences and other crimes and how to achieve better results in the investigation of drug-related cases, with particular emphasis on addressing illicit financial flows, money-laundering and asset forfeiture. Strengthening financial investigations and enhancing cooperation between drug control and financial intelligence units were highlighted as key measures to dismantle drug-related criminal networks. The importance of addressing the challenges posed by the criminal misuse of virtual currencies as part of money-laundering schemes and in view of the association of such currencies with several predicate offences, including drug-trafficking, was highlighted. 98. Several speakers emphasized the need for long-term, sustainable alternative development programmes, highlighting community empowerment as a key strategy in reducing the illicit cultivation of and trafficking in drugs. Speakers shared examples of initiatives and national strategies aimed at supporting cultivators in transitioning to licit crop production, including by promoting sustainable livelihoods through alternative crops such as rice, cocoa, coffee, potatoes and tomatoes, as well as addressing vulnerabilities in urban populations \u2013 particularly among adolescents \u2013 to prevent the non-medical use of drugs and involvement in microtrafficking. 99. Recognizing the complex and multifaceted nature of drug-related challenges, speakers emphasized the need for strengthened cooperation and coordination among national authorities at all levels. In addition, the importance of international, regional and bilateral collaboration was underscored, and the principle of common and shared responsibility was reaffirmed. In that context, regional cooperation and meetings were highlighted as key platforms for facilitating intelligence-sharing, exchanging best practices and coordinating enforcement efforts. In addition, some speakers drew attention to the impact of the world drug problem on transit countries.

In response, it was noted that sanctions and restrictions, implemented in full conformity with international law, could serve as lawful and effective tools to promote peace and security. 100. The importance of early warning systems was underscored, and speakers called for Member States to utilize existing tools to detect and respond swiftly to emerging drug-related threats. Strengthening those systems was recognized as essential to anticipating shifts in drug markets, identifying new psychoactive substances and mitigating public health and security risks before they escalate. Speakers also shared information on national efforts to enhance institutional capacities, including the establishment of forensic laboratories to improve drug analysis and detection and the creation of intelligence centres to strengthen inter-agency coordination. The use of advanced technologies, such as data integration systems, predictive analytics, artificial intelligence and information security tools, was highlighted as a means to enhance real-time monitoring and decision-making. 101. Many speakers also stressed the importance of ensuring the meaningful participation of civil society, the scientific community, communities, local stakeholders and affected populations in the development, implementation and evaluation of drug policies. 102. Meeting the need for enhanced technical assistance and resource mobilization was widely emphasized as a critical factor in strengthening responses to drug-related challenges. Many speakers underscored the importance of capacity-building efforts E/2025/28 E/CN.7/2025/11 43 aimed at equipping law enforcement agencies, national laboratories, healthcare professionals and civil society service providers with the necessary skills and tools. 103. Many speakers reaffirmed their strong support for UNODC and its central role in coordinating international drug policy responses, providing technical assistance and capacity-building and conducting research to help Member States effectively address drug-related challenges. B. Action taken by the Commission 104. At its 9th meeting, on 14 March 2025, the Commission adopted a revised draft resolution entitled \u201cPromoting comprehensive, scientific evidence-based and multisectoral national systems of drug use prevention for children and adolescents\u201d (E/CN.7/2025/L.2/Rev.1), sponsored by Albania, Algeria, Andorra, Armenia, Australia, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Egypt, Ghana, Guatemala, Honduras, Indonesia, Japan, Kyrgyzstan, Morocco, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, Poland (on behalf of the States Members of the United Nations that are members of the European Union), the Russian Federation, Singapore, Switzerland, Thailand, the United Kingdom and Uruguay. (For the text of the resolution, see chap. I, sect. B, resolution 68/1.) 105. Upon the adoption of the revised draft resolution, the representatives of Chile and Egypt made statements. Statements in explanation of vote were made by the representatives of the United States and Argentina. 106. The representative of the United States noted the strong support of his delegation for efforts to promote effective approaches to the prevention of drug use among children and young people. He indicated, however, that his delegation had decided to call for a vote on revised draft resolution E/CN.7/2025/L.2/Rev.1, as it was concerned that the revised draft resolution represented a reaffirmation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals set out therein, which, in the view of his delegation, advanced a programme of soft global governance that was inconsistent with the sovereignty of the United States and adverse to the rights and interests of Americans. He stated that the United States rejected and denounced the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals, and that it would no longer reaffirm them as a matter of course. Lastly, he indicated that the text of the revised draft resolution had failed to use precise language regarding the biological reality that there were two sexes: male and female.",

Lastly, he indicated that the text of the revised draft resolution had failed to use precise language regarding the biological reality that there were two sexes: male and female. For those reasons, the United States had voted against the revised draft resolution. 107. The representative of Argentina expressed the full commitment of his delegation to promoting comprehensive national drug use prevention systems for children and adolescents. He thanked Chile for the flexibility it had shown throughout the discussions on the revised draft resolution adopted. He noted, however, that the word \u201cgender\u201d, as it appeared in international treaties, in the view of his delegation, referred to the two sexes, male and female, and that, in the context of society, the term \u201cgender\u201d had no other meaning than that. Further, he noted that, for Argentina, the 2030 Agenda was composed of aspirations that were not legally binding, and that each State, in exercise of its sovereignty, had the right to pursue those aspirations freely. 108. At the same meeting, the Commission took action on a revised draft resolution entitled \u201cPromoting research on scientific evidence-based interventions for the treatment and care of stimulant use disorders\u201d (E/CN.7/2025/L.3/Rev.1), sponsored by Australia, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Ghana, Guatemala, Japan, Honduras, Morocco, New Zealand, the Niger, Norway, Peru, Poland (on behalf of the States Members of the United Nations that are members of the European Union), the Russian Federation, South Africa, Switzerland, Thailand and the United Kingdom.

The Commission adopted by a vote of 49 to 2, with no abstentions, revised draft resolution E/CN.7/2025/L.3/Rev.1. (For the text of the resolution, see chap. I, sect. B, resolution 68/2.) E/2025/28 E/CN.7/2025/11 44 109. Upon the adoption of the revised draft resolution, the representatives of Thailand and Norway made statements. Statements in explanation of vote were made by the representatives of the United States and Argentina. 110. The representative of the United States stated that his country supported efforts to promote research on pharmacological treatments for those battling the harms associated with the non-medical use of stimulant drugs. That support notwithstanding, his delegation had decided to call for a vote on the revised draft resolution, as it had concerns about the language used throughout the text. He stated that, firstly, the text failed to acknowledge the natural reality that there were two sexes, male and female, and that for the freedom and dignity of all men and women, the use of gender ideology-related terms must be stopped, and secondly, that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals advanced a programme of soft global governance that constituted an overreach into national decision-making and was therefore inconsistent with the sovereignty of the United States and adverse to the rights and interests of Americans. He stated that the United States rejected and denounced the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals, and that the United States would no longer reaffirm them as a matter of course. He concluded that for those reasons, the United States had voted against the revised draft resolution. 111. The representative of Argentina stated that, in the view of his delegation, the word \u201cgender\u201d, as included in international treaties, referred to the two sexes, male and female, and that, in the context of society, the term \u201cgender\u201d had no other meaning than that. With regard to the gender perspective, he underlined that the commitment of Argentina to women\u2019s rights was long-standing and was incorporated in its legislation and domestic practices, which went beyond international standards. He stated, however, that implementing a sectorized perspective on human rights led to inequities that were contrary to the goal of non-discrimination. He further stated that, for Argentina, the 2030 Agenda was composed of aspirations that were not legally binding, and that each State, in exercise of its sovereignty, was free to interpret those aspirations. 112.",

At the same meeting, the Commission took action on a revised draft resolution entitled \u201cComplementing the United Nations Guiding Principles on Alternative Development\u201d (E/CN.7/2025/L.4/Rev.1), sponsored by Albania, Armenia, Brazil, China, Colombia, Ghana, Honduras, Indonesia, Japan, Norway, Peru, Poland (on behalf of the States Members of the United Nations that are members of the European Union), Switzerland, Thailand and the United Kingdom. The representative of the United States requested a vote on revised draft resolution E/CN.7/2025/L.4/Rev.1. The Commission adopted, by a vote of 48 to 2, with one abstention, revised draft resolution E/CN.7/2025/L.4/Rev.1. (For the text of the resolution, see chap. I, sect. B, resolution 68/3.) 113. Upon the adoption of the revised draft resolution, the representatives of Peru, Germany and Thailand made statements. Statements in explanation of vote were made by the representatives of Guatemala, Argentina, the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran. 114. The representative of Guatemala stated that his delegation had voted in favour of the revised draft resolution entitled \u201cComplementing the United Nations Guiding Principles on Alternative Development\u201d, tabled by Germany, Peru and Thailand. Guatemala considered that the resolution was aimed at furthering the work in the area of alternative development and considered that work to be important for its region. He noted, however, that for Guatemala, any reference to Indigenous Peoples must respect the characteristics, nature and the origins of the rights of Indigenous Peoples, as well as the work done and recommendations made by established mechanisms to safeguard everything relating to Indigenous Peoples, namely, the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the Special Rapporteur on the rights of Indigenous Peoples. The representative reiterated his country\u2019s strong reservation to the tenth preambular paragraph of the E/2025/28 E/CN.7/2025/11 45 resolution, especially because it considered the use of the term \u201clocal communities\u201d to be arbitrary and a surreptitious attempt to subsume the term \u201cIndigenous Peoples\u201d within a term empty of explicit content, that is, \u201clocal communities\u201d, in a specialized forum, namely, the Commission, which could not be accepted by Guatemala. Furthermore, he noted that there was no authoritative source for the term \u201clocal communities\u201d in international instruments and that the use of the term undermined the acknowledged rights of Indigenous Peoples. He stated that, for those reasons, his delegation would like its reservation to be reflected in the report. 115. The representative of Argentina stated that, in the view of his delegation, the word \u201cgender\u201d, as included in international treaties, referred to the two sexes, female and male, and that, in the context of society, the term \u201cgender\u201d had no other meaning than that. Further, he stated that, for Argentina, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was composed of aspirations that were not legally binding, and that each State, in the exercise of its sovereignty, had the right to interpret and pursue those aspirations freely. 116. The representative of the United States stated that his country was concerned about the use in the text of language reaffirming the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals. Although framed in neutral language, the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals, in the view of his delegation, advanced a programme of soft global governance that was inconsistent with the sovereignty of the United States and adverse to the rights and interests of Americans. He stated that the United States rejected and denounced the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals, and that the United States would no longer reaffirm them as a matter of course. He also stated that the text of the resolution failed to use precise language regarding the biological reality that there were two sexes, male and female, and that, in the view of his delegation, it was time for a clear and overdue course correction with regard to gender ideology. He further stated that the resolution went beyond the scope of alternative development, which was intended to address illicit crop cultivation, and read more as a resolution on sustainable development. 117.",

He further stated that the resolution went beyond the scope of alternative development, which was intended to address illicit crop cultivation, and read more as a resolution on sustainable development. 117. The representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran stated that, while noting the efforts made by the sponsors of the resolution to achieve consensus, his delegation wished to express its serious concern about the fact that the resolution, as in the case of previous resolutions, once again departed from agreed text as reflected in similar draft resolutions tabled at the sixty-sixth session of the Commission. In that regard, he noted with concern that the resolution had refrained from reflecting one of the major challenges that some Member States had encountered with regard to unilateral coercive sanctions imposed on those States in contravention of international law. Regarding the issue of gender, he stated that, in the view of his delegation, the meaning of the term \u201cgender\u201d was restricted to the female and male sexes. With regard to sustainable development and the Sustainable Development Goals, he stated that his delegation believed that progress had been made in the implementation of the Goals; however, it was of the view that those were political commitments that were composed of all ideas, including respect for the national laws, regulations and policies of Member States, that should be highlighted with every effort in those kinds of resolutions. 118. At the same meeting, the Commission took action on a draft resolution, as revised, entitled \u201cSafety of officers in dismantling illicit synthetic drug laboratories, in particular those involving synthetic opioids\u201d (E/CN.7/2025/L.5), sponsored by Albania, Armenia, Australia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Ghana, Honduras, Japan, Mexico, Morocco, New Zealand, Norway, Poland (on behalf of the States Members of the United Nations that are members of the European Union), Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The representative of the United States requested a vote on draft resolution E/CN.7/2025/L.5, as revised. The Commission adopted by a vote of 48 to 1, with 2 abstentions, draft resolution E/CN.7/2025/L.5, as revised. (For the text of the resolution, see chap. I, sect. B, resolution 68/4.) E/2025/28 E/CN.7/2025/11 46 119. Upon the adoption of the draft resolution, as revised, the representatives of Poland and Mexico made statements. The representatives of the United States and Argentina made statements in explanation of vote. 120. The representative of the United States stated that his delegation was concerned about the use in the text of the resolution of language reaffirming the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals. Although they were framed in neutral language, in the view of his delegation, the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals advanced a programme of soft global governance that was inconsistent with the sovereignty of the United States and adverse to the rights and interests of Americans. He stated that the United States would therefore no longer reaffirm them as a matter of course. 121. The representative of Argentina reaffirmed his country\u2019s commitment, and the importance it attached, to the safety of officers in dismantling illicit synthetic drug laboratories, and explained that that was the reason why his delegation had abstained from voting on the draft resolution, as revised. He stated, however, that for Argentina, the 2030 Agenda, to which references were contained in the resolution, was made up of aspirations that were not legally binding, and that each State, in exercise of its sovereignty, was free to pursue those aspirations. 122. At the same meeting, the Commission took action on a revised draft resolution entitled \u201cAddressing the impacts of illicit drug-related activities on the environment\u201d (E/CN.7/2025/L.7/Rev.1), sponsored by Albania, Andorra, Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Brazil, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Ecuador, Ghana, Honduras, Japan, Morocco, Norway, Peru, Poland (on behalf of the States Members of the United Nations that are members of the European Union), Switzerland and the United Kingdom.

Upon adoption of the revised draft resolution, the representatives of France, Brazil, Morocco and Costa Rica made statements. Statements in explanation of vote were made by the representatives of Guatemala, the United States, Argentina, the Islamic Republic of Iran and China. 124. The representative of Guatemala indicated that his delegation had voted in favour of the draft resolution, as revised, and considered that it addressed a very important subject, namely, the environmental impact of illicit drug-related activities, and promoted the development of evidence-based policies to mitigate the negative impact of such activities on ecosystems. He noted, however, that for Guatemala, any reference to Indigenous Peoples must respect the characteristics, nature and the origins of the rights of Indigenous Peoples, as well as the work done and recommendations made by established mechanisms to safeguard everything relating to Indigenous Peoples, namely, the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the Special Rapporteur on the rights of Indigenous Peoples. The representative reiterated his country\u2019s strong reservation to paragraph 8 of the resolution, especially because it considered the use of the term \u201clocal communities\u201d to be arbitrary and a surreptitious attempt to subsume the term \u201cIndigenous Peoples\u201d within a term empty of explicit content, that is, \u201clocal communities\u201d, in a specialized forum, namely, the Commission, which could not be accepted by Guatemala. Furthermore, he noted that there was no authoritative source for the term \u201clocal communities\u201d in international instruments and that the use of the term undermined the acknowledged rights of Indigenous Peoples. He stated that, for those reasons, his delegation would like its reservation to be reflected in the report. 125. The representative of the United States stated that his country recognized that illicit drug-related activities could adversely affect the environment. He expressed the view that, unfortunately, the resolution deviated significantly from the worthy goal of addressing that issue and therefore the United States had called for a vote on the revised draft resolution and had voted against it because much of the text violated E/2025/28 E/CN.7/2025/11 47 current policies of the United States. He stated that a primary concern of the United States was the reference in the resolution to the Sustainable Development Goals, and that those Goals advanced a programme of soft global governance that was inconsistent with the sovereignty of the United States and adverse to the rights and interests of Americans. He noted that the citizens of all Member States should be concerned about the inclusion of the reference to the Sustainable Development Goals in that text, which was ostensibly focused on addressing the impacts of drug-related activities on the environment, a real and present problem that would not be resolved through the Sustainable Development Goals. He noted that the text of the resolution also failed to use precise language regarding the biological reality that there were two sexes: male and female. Of greatest concern, in the view of his delegation, was the mention of the terms \u201cgender-disaggregated data\u201d and \u201cgender-sensitive policies and programmes\u201d, concepts for which, he claimed, there were no agreed definitions. Moreover, he stated that those terms were used to endorse divisive cultural causes and champion the censorship of viewpoints online. Lastly, he expressed concern that the resolution called for UNODC to continue activities for which the United States was still evaluating its support, both financial and political. 126. The representative of Argentina explained that his country had voted against the revised draft resolution because it contained references to the word \u201cgender\u201d, which, as his country believed, was used in international treaties to refer to the two sexes, male and female, and stated that, in the context of society, the term \u201cgender\u201d had no other meaning than that.",

The representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran stated that, for his country, as a member of the Commission, in view of the activities of his country at the front line of efforts to combat narcotic drugs in the region and as a neighbouring country to Afghanistan, the decisions of the Commission were very important. He noted that his delegation had actively participated in the meetings and informal consultations on the revised draft resolution and had tried to harmonize the text so that it would reflect the concerns of his delegation and those of other members of the Commission; however, unfortunately, none or almost none of those concerns had been reflected by the co-sponsors. He stated that in any case his delegation had joined the decision. 128. The representative of China indicated that his delegation had voted in favour of the resolutions adopted at the session and had participated as a co-sponsor of some of them, although China had its own ideas and proposals for some of the content contained in the resolutions. He noted that China had been very flexible and proactive in participating in the drafting of the resolutions and had made its own contribution to the successful passing of the resolutions by landslide, overwhelming majorities. He emphasized that China had a positive attitude towards the content regarding the Sustainable Development Goals and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development contained in the above-mentioned resolutions, and noted that China, together with other States members of the Commission, including those that were developing countries, actively supported the Sustainable Development Goals and actively supported the view that the Commission should emphasize the Sustainable Development Goals and development-related issues in its resolutions. In addition, he mentioned the importance attached by developing countries and the global South to development-related issues, and that China would continue to work with the countries of the global South and the States members of the Commission in the continuing efforts to promote development-related issues in the work of the Commission.

Deliberations 136. Many speakers reaffirmed commitments to international cooperation in addressing the world drug problem and emerging challenges through a comprehensive and balanced response. Reference was made to the three international drug conventions, together with other relevant international instruments, as the cornerstone of the international legal framework, and to the Commission on Narcotic Drugs as the policymaking body of the United Nations with prime responsibility for drug control. 137. Many speakers highlighted the vital role of inter-agency cooperation among all sectors and at all levels, as well as among United Nations entities and with civil society, in implementing international drug policy commitments and resolutions, to effectively respond to the complex nature of the world drug problem. In this regard, reference was made to the importance of an evidence-based approach, science, the coordination of data collection and the sharing of data, as well as rule of law and human rights. 138. A number of speakers reaffirmed their continued commitment to the work of UNODC as the leading United Nations entity on drug-related matters and referred to activities implemented at the national and regional levels.

Reference was made to the importance of collaboration between UNODC, INCB and WHO in ensuring that drug policies remained evidence-based. Some speakers also referred to important collaborations with other relevant entities, such as INTERPOL, OHCHR, UNAIDS, the United Nations Development Programme and the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women), within their mandated functions, and the participation of those entities in the work of the Commission was welcomed. In the context of further enhancing synergies, reference was made to the recent signing of the UNODC-United Nations Industrial Development Organization memorandum of understanding and to the importance of the future participation of the United Nations Environment Programme in the work of the Commission. 140. Some speakers referred to the United Nations system common position supporting the implementation of the international drug control policy through effective inter-agency collaboration and expressed support to UNODC for leading the United Nations system coordination task team on the implementation of the United Nations system common position. UNODC was encouraged by some speakers to provide more regular briefings to Member States on the implementation of the common position. 141. Many speakers mentioned the threat posed by illicit drug use and illicit drug trafficking and related crimes, and highlighted the necessity of taking effective measures, including capacity-building, technical assistance and intelligence exchange. Reference was made to specific initiatives, in particular those aimed at preventing illicit drug use, as well as to enhancing access to treatment and care and recovery measures. Reference was also made to activities aimed at improving the capacity of law enforcement agencies at seaports, airports and land border crossings, as well as the role of laboratories, early warning systems and postal services. 142. Some speakers expressed commitment to a drug-free world. One speaker expressed the view that the international drug control system was unable to keep up with the evolution of drug-related matters.

E/2025/28 E/CN.7/2025/11 51 Chapter VIII Contributions by the Commission to the work of the Economic and Social Council, including follow-up to and review and implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 147. At its 8th meeting, on 13 March 2025, the Commission considered agenda item 9, entitled \u201cContributions by the Commission to the work of the Economic and Social Council, including follow-up to and review and implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\u201d. 148. The Chief of the Secretariat to the Governing Bodies of UNODC and the Officer-in-Charge of the Division for Policy Analysis and Public Affairs of UNODC made introductory statements. 149. Statements were made by the representatives of Thailand (pre-recorded video), Argentina, India, Colombia and the United States. 150. Statements were also made by the observers for OHCHR, INTERPOL, the Eurasian Harm Reduction Association, the Slum Child Foundation, Youth RISE and the Vienna NGO Committee on Drugs. Deliberations 151. Some speakers reiterated their commitment to implementing the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals and to addressing global challenges such as climate change, as well as the protection of human rights and the promotion of gender equality. 152. The importance of alternative development for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda was mentioned by some speakers, as well as the need to foster collaboration and knowledge exchange to enhance alternative development interventions. The use of meditation as a preventive strategy as well as an adjunctive treatment for those affected by drug use disorders was also noted. 153. One speaker stated that her Government defined the term \u201cgender\u201d in line with article 7, paragraph 3, of the Rome Statute and referred to her Government\u2019s sustained commitment to protecting women\u2019s rights without generating inequities that it considered to go against the principle of non-discrimination. In the view of her Government, the 2030 Agenda was made up of legally non-binding aspirations that each State, in the exercise of its sovereignty, had the right to interpret and freely pursue. The speaker further recalled her country\u2019s dissent on the Pact for the Future. 154. One speaker stated that her country opposed the link between the work of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs and the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals. The view was expressed that the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals advanced a programme of soft global governance that was inconsistent with that country\u2019s sovereignty and adverse to the rights and interests of the country\u2019s citizens. The speaker requested that the agenda item should instead reaffirm the Commission\u2019s core purpose of assisting the Economic and Social Council in supervising the application of the international drug control treaties.

There was strong interest in the theme among delegations. After consultations with regional groups, civil society and United Nations entities, an initial draft resolution, contained in an informal paper, was released by the Chair on 3 March.

During the negotiations, all aspects of the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development related to the special theme were discussed in a meaningful way, and compromise language was put forward by various delegations. Five delegations broke silence over the first revision of the draft resolution, which had been placed under a silence procedure by the co-facilitators. __________________ 1 Official Records of the Economic and Social Council, 2025, Supplement No. 5 (E/2025/25). 2 E/CN.9/2025/L.2. 3 E/CN.9/2025/L.5. E/2025/25 E/CN.9/2025/7 25-06558 5/14 On 10 April, after extensive bilateral outreach, the Chair circulated a text, contained in E/CN.9/2025/L.4,4 that was aimed at accommodating, to the extent possible, the concerns of delegations that had broken silence. One delegation continued to oppose aspects of the text, including at least one that was of critical importance to the vast majority of Member States: the reaffirmation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In the Chair\u2019s text, the Programme of Action and the outcomes of related United Nations high-level meetings were reaffirmed, and it was emphasized that their full implementation was crucial to achieving the objectives of the 2030 Agenda. Member States agreed to reaffirm the core principle that health was a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. The text served to acknowledge the root causes of adverse health outcomes such as inequalities, including gender inequality, food insecurity and malnutrition, poverty, and lack of access to education, healthcare and decent work. The negative impacts on health of humanitarian crises, pandemics, natural disasters and armed conflict were mentioned, and it was acknowledged that food security and food safety, adequate and accessible nutrition, and nutrition-sensitive food systems were important elements for addressing malnutrition. The structure of the text followed the stages of the life course, ranging from newborn and maternal health to the health needs of children, young people, adolescents and older persons. Specific needs of those groups were recognized, such as ensuring access to youth-friendly healthcare services, including young people in decision-making, addressing reproductive cancers, eliminating age discrimination and fostering a culture in which menstruation was recognized as healthy and natural and the needs of women in perimenopause or menopause were met. Member States found agreement on language about HIV/AIDS. The text also included language on physical and mental health, communicable and non-communicable diseases, tuberculosis and malaria, and antimicrobial resistance. The health needs of migrants and persons with disabilities were acknowledged, and Member States agreed to reaffirm the right of children to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. In the text, it was acknowledged that strengthening healthcare systems and primary healthcare was critical, including through community-based services and access to vaccines, medicines and medical countermeasures, especially against the background of rapid demographic change, and that investments in capacity-building were needed to ensure a skilled health workforce, including midwives. The text served to recognize the importance of health financing and the role of technologies in improving access to healthcare. In the text, the centrality of achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls and the realization of their human rights was recognized. It was also recognized that particular attention must be given to addressing the health needs and well-being of all women and girls, including by eliminating sexual and gender- based violence and harmful practices. The text served to highlight the role that healthcare services, including for mental health, and psychosocial support can play in responding to sexual and gender-based violence for victims and survivors. The need for the reduction and redistribution of unpaid care and domestic work was recognized, as was the association of such a need with job creation and sustainable economic growth.",

E/2025/25 E/CN.9/2025/7 6/14 25-06558 While differing views on sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights presented a challenge for achieving consensus, many delegations were ready to agree on three paragraphs on those topics in conjunction with a paragraph reaffirming the sovereign right of each country to implement the recommendations in the resolution in a manner that is consistent with its national laws and development priorities. In the text, Member States were called upon to ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive healthcare services and to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, including for family planning, information and education, fertility and infertility care, and the prevention, treatment and destigmatization of sexually transmitted infections and HIV. Some delegations proposed language on family that was not acceptable to others if not accompanied by language on comprehensive sexuality education or on multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination.

Mention of such a symbol indicates a reference to a United Nations document. ISSN 1728-0036 25-06882 3/26 Summary The Committee of Experts on Public Administration held its twenty-fourth session at United Nations Headquarters in New York from 7 to 11 April 2025. The theme of the session was \u201cGovernance and institutional perspectives on advancing sustainable, inclusive, science- and evidence-based solutions for the Sustainable Development Goals\u201d, in alignment with the 2025 theme of the Economic and Social Council and the high-level political forum on sustainable development. The Committee stressed that staying the course towards the Goals at times of polycrises, geopolitical tensions, conflicts and wars, disruption of basic features of globalization, declining trust in government, resource strain and fast-changing technology required an urgent shift of governments towards comprehensive systems thinking and action. Strengthening the conditions for scientists to conduct high- quality, independent research effectively was seen as pivotal. Referring to the application of the principles of effective governance, the Committee emphasized that the transformation towards sustainable development called for urgent attention to questions of inclusion and equity in governance systems. This was particularly important, as achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and leaving no one behind depended on the provision of substantive equality of opportunity for all across the three dimensions of sustainable development in a balanced and integrated manner. Building on its previous work, the Committee studied ways of ensuring the transparency and accountability of artificial intelligence systems in public administration. Various strategies were highlighted relating to the development of steering and oversight mechanisms and establishment of safeguards to mitigate bias and protect fundamental rights. Supreme audit institutions could play an important role in that area by developing common approaches to auditing artificial intelligence use in public administration, among other actions. Addressing shortcomings in sustainable public financial management was another area of concern. As no single initiative was likely to be sufficient to ensure the health of public finances on its own, the Committee recommended a comprehensive approach to public financial management reform. In the light of multiple ongoing crises in many countries, the Committee drew particular attention to the need for the proper management of emergency funding and to limit its use for non-emergency purposes. The Committee reiterated that, in order for governments to be able to perform a broad spectrum of functions and deliver public services, a dedicated and skilled public sector workforce was required. That in turn required various human resources strategies to attract and retain workers of all ages and backgrounds, including younger generations. Promotion of a wide-ranging social dialogue among all stakeholders could also help to strengthen public sector responsiveness to the needs of society, thereby reinforcing a core motivation of public sector workers and accelerating delivery of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. On institutions and climate action, the Committee emphasized that extreme heat and related events had become more frequent and more deadly due to the increase in global temperatures. Effective governance for extreme heat at all levels was required in response. This included strategies to prepare for and respond to such events, and to invest in energy resilience and adaptation. Enhancing collective resilience and responding to disparate mandates across institutions required strengthened 4/26 25-06882 collaboration among policymakers and regulators, as well as academia, civil society and private sector actors. The Committee underscored the impact of widespread mental health challenges in post-conflict countries on effective governance for sustainable development and the delivery of public services. Enhanced efforts by Governments to integrate effective and inclusive responses to the mental health and psychosocial support needs of individuals and communities into peacebuilding efforts were recommended, together with the strengthening of mental health systems to reinforce long-term recovery.",

Climate change and environmental policy, and health policy, were highlighted as areas in which a focus on science- and evidence-based solutions had enabled policymakers to move beyond ideological debates to focus on collaborative approaches to global challenges. Strengthening the conditions for scientists to conduct high-quality, independent research and effectively engage in policy processes was seen as pivotal. The Committee stressed that staying the course of Sustainable Development Goal implementation at times of polycrises, geopolitical tensions, conflicts and wars, declining trust in government, resource strain and fast-changing technology required an urgent shift of governments towards comprehensive systems thinking and action. 5. The Committee further examined the 2025 theme from a governance and public administration perspective at its twenty-fourth session and reaffirmed the main messages of its earlier contribution. The Committee also engaged in a peer exchange with four voluntary national review countries (Brazil, Burkina Faso, Namibia and Zimbabwe) with the objective of promoting direct interaction on the institutional aspects of Sustainable Development Goals 16 and 17. Each presented concrete experiences and good practices for discussion. 6.

Principles of effective governance for delivery of equitable and sustainable development for all 14. The Committee highlighted that, as the timeline for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals approached, vulnerable groups frequently lacked opportunities and socioeconomic resources, were particularly affected by ongoing multiple crises and at risk of being left behind. To achieve the vision of the 2030 Agenda, there was an urgent need to refocus attention on ending poverty in all its forms, address discrimination and exclusion and reduce inequalities and vulnerabilities that hindered human potential, especially at the local level, where disparities and inequalities were more evident. 15. Achieving equitable and sustainable development for all required a holistic and multifaceted approach that integrated economic growth with social equity and environmental sustainability. Such an approach could help to provide equal opportunities for all and reach even the most vulnerable, lifting them out of poverty, offering well-being and social protection, promoting dignity and fostering resilience. 16. Equitable governance, which referred to the rule of law and the fair distribution of power, responsibilities, wealth, resources and opportunities within society, was a significant factor. Political will also played a crucial role, notably the will to address structural and financial constraints and the determination to translate policies and knowledge into action. 17. The Committee noted that strong institutions, effective governance and commitment to human rights, the rule of law, accountability and transparency were prerequisites for equitable and sustainable development. Action in those areas also contributed to building trust in government and establishing a supportive and stable environment for economic growth. 18. Sound and targeted strategies were required to address the unique challenges and opportunities of each country, taking into account different national realities, capacities and levels of development and respecting national policies and priorities. In order to promote social cohesion and economic stability, various strategies and approaches, such as decent work, progressive taxation, increased access to social services and inclusive labour markets, should be pursued. Reforms that fought and curbed corruption, improved the effectiveness of the public sector, promoted local revenue autonomy and allowed for more participatory decision-making could be given greater priority. Public investment as an enabler of sustainable development for all 19.",

Reforms that fought and curbed corruption, improved the effectiveness of the public sector, promoted local revenue autonomy and allowed for more participatory decision-making could be given greater priority. Public investment as an enabler of sustainable development for all 19. The Committee stressed that the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the sustainable development of any country were based on the human potential of its institutions, organizations, territories and communities. Thus, investing in human capital needed to be seen as a priority. That implied the need to promote equal opportunities in education, science and knowledge-sharing, with expanded access to high-quality education at all levels, from early childhood to the post-secondary level, and including vocational and professional training. To improve life expectancy and lower the burden of diseases, investment in public health programmes and healthcare infrastructure and ensuring access to necessary health services were also critical. E/2025/44 E/C.16/2025/9 25-06882 15/26 20. The development of sustainable infrastructure and connectivity was another area of public investment that required attention, in particular to bridge digital divides. Infrastructure improvements in various areas, such as health, energy, water and sanitation, housing and transportation, could increase market accessibility, boost competitiveness and improve living standards, thereby fostering economic and social progress. Promoting multi-stakeholder partnerships and international cooperation 21. The Committee observed that providing opportunities for all required a change of mindset, adaptability and multi-stakeholder collaboration, including between the public and private sectors. That required a whole-of-society approach and a change in the way that public institutions, private businesses, civil society organizations, academic and research communities and citizens worked together to achieve equitable and sustainable development. Building sustainable communities and cities required localization of the Goals in a way that encouraged State and non-State actors to work together in the creation and design of innovative and sustainable solutions. Mapping and disseminating good practices, peer learning and review, benchmarking, empowerment and capacity-building could inspire others. 22. In line with Goal 17, international cooperation and partnerships were crucial for facilitating equitable and sustainable development. Engaging actively in multilateral forums, seeking strategic partnerships and leveraging technical and financial assistance would be crucial. Shared responsibilities were key to ensuring that no country was being left behind. Promoting diverse forms of international cooperation and partnerships, in particular South-South and triangular cooperation, was also key, as such partnerships could take into account the realities and needs of the partners involved. Strengthening governance systems in the transformation to sustainable development 23. The Committee further engaged in a dialogue with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the International Labour Organization and the United Nations Development Programme on strengthening governance systems in the transformation to sustainable development for all and underscored that the enhanced governance of energy, agrifood and labour administration systems could reduce poverty and inequality, create jobs, strengthen trust in institutions and benefit all of society. Decisive leadership, systems thinking, improved approaches, equipping stakeholders with a long-term perspective and improved capacities for collective action were needed. Digital technology, data and science could help. 24. The most delicate issue in a systems approach was finding appropriate governance arrangements to manage trade-offs. Challenges in institutional capacities and fragmentation across sectors commonly hindered action. At the same time, strong institutions for sustainable development across sectors had a critical role to play in navigating various interests. United Nations agencies had found it useful to refer to the principles of effective governance for sustainable development in strengthening governance systems and were committed to collaboration and partnerships in promoting coherent and transformative action.

E/2025/44 E/C.16/2025/9 16/26 25-06882 B. Ensuring transparency and accountability of artificial intelligence systems in public administration Steering and oversight mechanisms to guide deployment 25. The Committee noted that the use of artificial intelligence in the public sector was growing, which offered numerous potential benefits, such as enhanced operational efficiency, reduced costs and improved service delivery and decision- making in most policy areas relevant to the Goals. There were already many useful lessons to be learned from national and international experiences, for example, with respect to the use of risk-based approaches to technological diffusion, wherein the benefits of artificial intelligence systems were harnessed first in low-risk, high- benefit policy domains. 26. At the same time, deployment of such systems posed potential ethical, regulatory and operational risks that had not been sufficiently addressed and required continued attention. To that end, Governments should be encouraged to focus on establishing the necessary structures, rules and procedures to direct the responsible and ethical use of artificial intelligence technology in the public interest, ensuring that the functioning of such instruments was consistent with national and international law. 27. The adoption of clear ownership and accountability mechanisms for artificial intelligence initiatives was important for assigning responsibility, so that remedies could be sought if and when issues arose. Specific strategies to steer and supervise responsible deployment across the public sector included: \u2022 Creation of a robust governance structure and specialized supervisory body at the centre of government to coordinate deployment across the public sector in a consistent, strategic and responsible manner, assess and address potential risks, oversee and enforce artificial intelligence regulations, provide training for public servants and collaborate with sector regulators. \u2022 Adoption of specific, inclusive, accountable and human-centric policies and strategies that supported national development objectives. Those needed to be linked to broader digital government strategies and/or connected with data governance strategies. \u2022 Development of common guidelines that outlined ethical standards, operational protocols and compliance mechanisms. \u2022 Employment of dynamic and continuously updated risk assessment protocols and customization of risk regulations on the basis of the identified risks, while imposing stricter oversight for systems deemed higher risk. Artificial intelligence developers also needed to be encouraged to proactively manage risk through regular reviews and self-assessment tools. \u2022 Encouragement of experimental approaches and the testing of artificial intelligence applications in controlled environments to evaluate their reliability and societal impact, identify potential risks, refine algorithms and test fitness for purpose before wider deployment. 28. The deployment of artificial intelligence in government could also be supported through enablers to facilitate its uptake, such as: a solid and safe digital public infrastructure; a robust data infrastructure and governance frameworks; a high degree and high quality of digital connectivity to ensure digital inclusion; a high level of maturity of cybersecurity systems; adequate computing capacity and digital skills within government; and smart procurement rules and arrangements so that artificial intelligence was procured effectively and innovation encouraged. E/2025/44 E/C.16/2025/9 25-06882 17/26 29. Interdisciplinary cooperation and participation mechanisms to engage stakeholders in the development and evaluation process, alongside partnerships to support trust-building and reciprocal learning, could also promote transparency and accountability. Novel partnerships with private sector entities, including government technology start-ups, could lead to the co-creation of innovative digital solutions. Safeguards to mitigate bias and protect fundamental rights 30. The Committee emphasized that safeguards and approaches to mitigate bias and protect fundamental rights should be adopted as a matter of priority to build public trust and so that the diffusion of the technology in public administration reinforced the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and left no one behind.",

The Committee emphasized that safeguards and approaches to mitigate bias and protect fundamental rights should be adopted as a matter of priority to build public trust and so that the diffusion of the technology in public administration reinforced the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and left no one behind. The provision of robust human oversight was crucial to ensuring that artificial intelligence systems were ethical, transparent and accountable. 31. Specifically, Governments should take concrete steps to guard against bias by: \u2022 Adopting ethical standards and mandatory procedures and embedding ethical and transparency considerations in the rules and protocols for government procurement of artificial intelligence. \u2022 Adopting ex ante due diligence and impact assessment frameworks and ex post verification processes, including public participation, self-assessment and monitoring. \u2022 Developing protocols to allow for transparency, traceability and explicability of decisions reached using artificial intelligence. \u2022 Following a human rights-centric approach in which governments actively informed individuals when they interacted with artificial intelligence and in which artificial intelligence decisions were broken down and explained. \u2022 Ensuring public disclosure of the design, data sources and decision-making processes of artificial intelligence systems in a manner comprehensible to non-technical users. \u2022 Providing opportunities for users to challenge decisions made using algorithms, provide feedback on the performance of those systems and have access to means of redress, including judicial review. \u2022 Educating and raising awareness to address knowledge gaps and increase algorithmic literacy; supporting investigative journalism and oversight by civil society; and raising awareness among developers and users of algorithms of the importance of transparency and accountability measures. The role of supreme audit institutions 32. The Committee observed that supreme audit institutions played an important role as part of the broader accountability framework for public administration. Efforts by countries to empower and adequately equip them with the knowledge and information technology infrastructure required to use artificial intelligence systems themselves and to audit their use by government entities required attention. 33. To that end, the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions was encouraged to: (a) establish clear ethical and operational guidelines for the use of artificial intelligence systems by its members; (b) assist less advanced supreme audit institutions in developing artificial intelligence applications; and (c) develop common approaches for auditing artificial intelligence use in public administrations. E/2025/44 E/C.16/2025/9 18/26 25-06882 34. Regulators could assist in shaping the audit landscape by providing guidance on best practices and establishing mandatory requirements for algorithm audits in high- risk sectors. Developing open-source frameworks for algorithm auditing could facilitate collaboration and knowledge-sharing among auditors, researchers and practitioners, which could lead to more consistent practices across different organizations. C. Sound, inclusive, science- and evidence-based public financial management for the Sustainable Development Goals 35. The Committee, referring to the 2030 Agenda and the recently adopted Pact for the Future, pointed to the significant global financing gaps in implementing the Goals and noted various shortcomings in public financial management that, given the scope of national and international commitments and the volatility and complexity of the current global context, risked exacerbating an already difficult situation in many countries. Those shortcomings included a lack of fiscal buffers, a predicted rise in spending pressures owing to consecutive crises, lower government revenues owing to a slowdown in global growth and increasing debt service payments, all of which contributed to ever-growing public debt and narrowed the room for manoeuvre in fiscal policy, particularly in developing countries. Promoting comprehensive public financial management reform 36. The Committee observed that more rigorous medium- and long-term financial planning, strengthened transparency and integrity, reform of selected financing policy areas, capacity-building of the public sector workforce and enhanced stakeholder engagement in fiscal policymaking and public financial management were all part of the solution.",

      "text": "s, all of which contributed to ever-growing public debt and narrowed the room for manoeuvre in fiscal policy, particularly in developing countries. Promoting comprehensive public financial management reform 36. The Committee observed that more rigorous medium- and long-term financial planning, strengthened transparency and integrity, reform of selected financing policy areas, capacity-building of the public sector workforce and enhanced stakeholder engagement in fiscal policymaking and public financial management were all part of the solution. At the same time, no single reform on its own was likely to be sufficient to ensure the health of public finances. The Committee therefore recommended that a comprehensive framework of public financial management reforms be elaborated to support government efforts to achieve the Goals in the near term and serve as an enduring reference beyond 2030. 37. Many relevant practices had been studied in depth by the Committee in recent years, and/or were areas in which there existed expansive research networks and development cooperation offerings among the relevant United Nations organizations, regional organizations and professional and academic communities. The main elements had been elaborated in an expert paper on the topic that had been presented and discussed during the twenty-fourth session.8 38. All such reforms needed to be adapted to context, while taking into account strategic use of technical capacity and political incentives. Public financial management could also benefit from leveraging data analysis, statistical methods and economic theory to help to inform decision-making. The concept of evidence-based financial management actively promoted the use of research findings to guide financial practices. Regular reviews and the updating of financial strategies on the basis of new data and research findings were also needed, drawing on, among others, the work of the global Sustainable Finance Hub of the United Nations Development Programme; the assessment by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development of governance mechanisms; and the work of the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability programme. 39. The Committee noted that concerted national and international efforts were needed to strengthen subnational financial management systems in a whole-of- government approach. In many countries, the decentralization architecture was __________________ 8 See E/C.16/2025/5, sect. V. E/2025/44 E/C.16/2025/9 25-06882 19/26 outdated, with many subnational jurisdictions lacking the capacity to generate own- source revenues or raise funds for capital investment and highly dependent on intergovernmental fiscal transfers and central government authorization and support for the implementation of the Goals. While private sector investment might compensate to some extent, public-private partnerships had also presented difficulties due to corruption, mismanagement of public funds and limited oversight, which necessitated enforcement of effective regulatory frameworks. Budget and financial management in times of crisis 40. Against a backdrop of ongoing multiple crises, the Committee drew attention to the need for the proper management of emergency funding and to limit its use for non-emergency purposes. While beneficial as a way to fast-track crisis response when needed, the deployment of emergency funding carried risks, such as a lack of financial oversight, accountability and transparency, as well as diversion of funds from longer- term national sustainable development priorities. 41. Borrowing in times of crises needed to be sustainable and built on reserves formed during better times, when accountable Governments were expected to save. However, most Governments were not capable of doing that, for political or implementation capacity reasons. Strengthening the medium-term orientation of the budget and more systematically identifying and managing fiscal risks, including through the accumulation of adequate fiscal buffers, were critical components of sound public financial management. 42. The establishment of fiscal rules could strengthen a Government\u2019s position by restricting overspending and at the same time preventing it from engaging in reckless behaviour. Fiscal rules might need to be expanded to include public private partnership-related operational measures, as well as related accountability measures that helped to discourage opportunism and foster transparency and accountability. 43. Fiscal councils played an active role in influencing fiscal policy outcomes and might be well positioned to play a greater role in conducting analysis, raising public awareness and highlighting the reputational cost of imprudent spending or practices.",

Fiscal councils played an active role in influencing fiscal policy outcomes and might be well positioned to play a greater role in conducting analysis, raising public awareness and highlighting the reputational cost of imprudent spending or practices. Moreover, fiscal councils could present inputs to the budget process by analysing procurement plans, thereby providing technical expertise to prevent Governments from circumventing fiscal rules. 44. The Committee further emphasized the need to be able to refer to detailed guidelines on emergency public procurement in times of crisis and for all emergency procurement processes to be subject to audit and oversight, with effective follow-up action. The United Nations Commission on International Trade Law Model Law on Public Procurement (2014) could be used by countries outside the European Union as model legislation to inspire measures for standard procurement, urgent or emergency procurement, simple and low-value procurement and large and complex projects. 45. The functionalities of electronic procurement platforms could helpfully be expanded to keep specific records on the procurement of emergency items and allow the public to track all emergency purchases. In times of emergency, beneficial ownership transparency was key to detecting cases of non-competitive procurement. Governments were thus encouraged to incorporate beneficial ownership transparency in their public procurement regulations and to issue regulations on requesting and publishing beneficial ownership information for all public procurement contracts. E/2025/44 E/C.16/2025/9 20/26 25-06882 D. Strategies for changing mindsets in the public sector, retaining talent and attracting younger workers 46. The Committee reiterated that, in order for Governments to be able to perform a broad spectrum of functions and deliver public services in line with national sustainable development plans and objectives, a dedicated and skilled public sector workforce was required. That in turn required effective human resources strategies for attracting and retaining public sector workers of all ages and backgrounds across government and in diverse occupational groups. The weight given to various factors in the design of such strategies would depend on national and local priorities and resources, as well as labour market conditions that varied from place to place and over time. 47. Despite differences in national and local contexts, many good practices could be recommended to national planners, civil service commissions, human resources departments and others involved in ensuring that public sector capabilities were aligned with a country\u2019s needs and aspirations, including those of its younger generations. Applying the revised 2025 standards of excellence for public administration education and training, for example, could help to develop a pipeline of qualified individuals committed to public service values, the operationalization of the principles of effective governance for sustainable development, and digital transformation. 48. With regard to conditions of service, the Committee highlighted the merits of adopting various strategies for attracting and retaining a qualified public sector workforce and leaving no one behind, such as: \u2022 Establishing competitive compensation and recognition systems. Governments should aim to provide competitive compensation packages and benefits, alongside transparent reward structures consisting of both financial incentives and career growth opportunities. Recognizing the importance of validation and motivation and rewarding contributions could foster loyalty and commitment. \u2022 Enhancing opportunities for work-life balance. Governments should consider policies that promoted flexibility, such as remote work options, flexible schedules and openness to mobility, which could be especially attractive to young workers. Such measures could also improve employee satisfaction and productivity. \u2022 Creating a variety of opportunities for professional growth. Structured programmes for learning and skills development, mentoring, leadership training and merit-based recruitment and promotion were important examples. Succession planning was also needed to identify and prepare future leaders. Providing clear career pathways to rapid growth and meaningful responsibility was key to retaining highly qualified and motivated individuals, whether they be younger workers or more senior public employees.",

Providing clear career pathways to rapid growth and meaningful responsibility was key to retaining highly qualified and motivated individuals, whether they be younger workers or more senior public employees. \u2022 Promoting a purpose-driven workplace culture. Public sector entities should emphasize their role in societal improvement and the alignment of their missions with public values. If opportunities for contributing to significant societal challenges and their root causes, such as climate change and social equity, were highlighted, that could resonate deeply with younger workers and others and help to attract the best and brightest to public service. \u2022 Adapting human resources management systems to evolving conditions. Governments must continuously modernize and adapt their human resources practices. Unified and data-driven human resources management systems could E/2025/44 E/C.16/2025/9 25-06882 21/26 offer valuable insights into workforce dynamics and lead to new strategies that addressed generational differences, among other concerns. \u2022 Right-sizing the public sector workforce. Governments should adopt a forward- looking approach, continuously monitoring the size and composition of the public sector workforce and judiciously recalibrating workforce capacities and skills in accordance with evolving needs on the basis of cost-benefit analyses and sustainable development impact assessments. That could help to avoid ad hoc crisis management decisions, which might have implications beyond financial costs. \u2022 Ensuring diversity, equity and inclusion. Promoting diversity, equity and inclusion, including through inclusive workplaces, addressing biases and ensuring equal opportunities, could also help to motivate and retain qualified individuals with a wider range of skills and experience. 49. The Committee stressed, in addition, that promoting a wide-ranging social dialogue among all stakeholders could enhance the responsiveness of the public sector to the needs of society, thereby reinforcing a core motivation of public sector workers and accelerating delivery of the 2030 Agenda. Effective social dialogue required an investment of dedicated effort, as well as the active engagement of workers, employers and government, including entities responsible for national human resources development policies. For that to happen, an enabling environment needed to be established that provided subnational governments in particular with the authority and resources needed to institutionalize related initiatives. 50. The success of social dialogue often depended on strong political will at all levels; a firm commitment to engaging in social dialogue with workers\u2019 representatives on the basis of international and national labour standards; a legal framework that accounted for the subnational dimension; and ongoing institutional arrangements, such as a subnational tripartite consultative committee. Other factors included sufficient resources to conduct exchanges in a professional and effective manner, committed and ethical representatives of workers (e.g. through associations and unions) and promotion of equitable access to the requisite information and data by all concerned. 51. Partnerships between subnational governments and the International Labour Organization, Public Services International and other actors could contribute to the mainstreaming of international labour standards at the subnational level while building subnational capacities. The sharing of best practices remained a valuable way of encouraging interaction among all relevant stakeholders and advancing decent work for all. E. Effective governance for extreme heat: integrating institutional frameworks with the clean energy transition 52. The Committee emphasized that extreme heat and related events, such as wildfires, droughts and power grid failures, had become more frequent and far more deadly due to rising global temperatures. Effective governance for extreme heat at all levels was required in response. 53. Governments would be well advised to begin preparing for extreme heat events with the same sense of urgency and rigour as that associated with preparedness for other climate hazards.",

Effective governance for extreme heat at all levels was required in response. 53. Governments would be well advised to begin preparing for extreme heat events with the same sense of urgency and rigour as that associated with preparedness for other climate hazards. Vulnerable population groups with limited access to cooling, ventilation and water faced the highest level of risk during extreme heat events and should be prioritized in extreme heat policies and interventions to help to ensure that no one was left behind. E/2025/44 E/C.16/2025/9 22/26 25-06882 54. In addition to the threat to human health and safety, a direct consequence of extreme heat was an increased demand for electricity and the corresponding strain on power grids. Many power grids continued to rely largely on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas to generate electricity, which in turn contributed to climate change and an increased risk of extreme heat events. The impact of rising temperatures therefore made it imperative to accelerate the transition to renewable energy. 55. The fragmented nature of institutional responsibility for mitigating and adapting to extreme heat was cause for further concern. Preparing for rising temperatures would require strengthened collaboration and coordination among all stakeholders, including policymakers and regulators at all levels of government, as well as with the academic community, civil society and private sector actors such as insurance companies, banks and investors. Strategies to prepare for and respond to extreme heat events 56. The Committee underscored the value of effective heat action plans that set out preventive measures and response strategies during heatwaves, ensuring that vulnerable populations received the necessary protection and resources. Chief heat officers could helpfully be designated to lead interdepartmental task forces to design such action plans. The plans should include measures such as identifying triggers and warnings for extreme heat events, identifying populations at highest risk, designing targeted programmes to provide cooling shelters, setting workplace health and safety standards, including for those working in the informal sector, and providing financial support to ensure access to efficient cooling for low-income households. 57. Ensuring reliable electricity access in public institutions, including health centres and schools, was also crucial for maintaining essential services, such as healthcare and education, during extreme heat events. Those institutions might also serve as cooling centres for vulnerable populations. 58. While local governments played a vital role in such efforts, they often lacked capacity, particularly in establishing effective coordination mechanisms across departments and promoting multilevel governance structures. In addition, local governments needed to work with other stakeholders, particularly utility companies, emergency services, builders (e.g. to adapt building codes for better insulation) and energy and healthcare providers, in the design of extreme heat response plans. 59. Targeted awareness campaigns were found to be useful in educating the public and other stakeholders about sustainable urban cooling and available cooling measures (e.g. cooling centres). There was also a need to raise awareness within countries about the broader issue of extreme heat and the importance of addressing the inequalities it exacerbates. Investing in energy resilience and adaptation 60. The Committee observed that investment in modernizing power grids was required to manage increased cooling demand. Decentralized energy systems could be promoted by developing microgrids and community-level solar installations to enhance local energy autonomy. Increased investment in solar, wind and battery storage could also reduce fossil fuel dependence. Adopting energy-efficient cooling systems, including by developing new technologies, could further reduce cooling energy demand. 61. Access to international climate finance was crucial for building institutional capacity, enhancing resilience and facilitating the clean energy transition in developing countries most vulnerable to extreme heat. Subnational governments required particular support in implementing context-specific adaptation measures. E/2025/44 E/C.16/2025/9 25-06882 23/26 Reform of climate finance mechanisms and the establishment of a global heat task force could help in coordinating and accelerating action. 62.

Enhancing coordination and collaboration 63. The Committee agreed that global frameworks and multilateral partnerships should be leveraged to promote international collaboration and share best practices and resources, thus enhancing collective resilience and responding to disparate mandates across institutions. 64. Given the interconnected nature of the impacts of extreme heat across sectors, cross-sectoral coordination was crucial, leading to coherent and sustainable solutions and facilitating national resilience-building. In many cases, it was important to link all those policy elements through a coordinated approach under the broader umbrella of climate action while also understanding accountability framework requirements for effective oversight. 65. Governments should be encouraged to adopt participatory approaches to engage local communities and other actors to ensure that energy transition and extreme heat strategies reflected local needs and built resilience. Public-private partnerships could be effective in driving innovation and promoting investment in sustainable solutions aimed at combating extreme heat, if properly managed. 66. Robust data and monitoring systems were indispensable tools for managing the impacts of extreme heat. Collected data from diverse sources could be used for public alerts, early warning systems, community response plans, health surveillance and climate change research. F. Governance of mental health to leave no one behind in post-conflict countries 67. The Committee noted with concern that more than 1 in 5 people in conflict- affected settings experienced some form of psychological distress or mental health condition at some point in time, with almost 1 in 10 having a moderate or severe diagnosis. That was particularly alarming given the rising number of armed conflicts worldwide and the impact that mental health conditions had on effective governance for sustainable development, the delivery of public services and, more generally, on prospects for long-term recovery in post-conflict countries. In addition, mental health conditions had consequences for public sector workers, who might be suffering from post-traumatic stress that affected their basic functioning and the services they provided. 68. Building strong institutions at all levels and accelerating progress towards the Goals necessitated greater attention to the treatment of mental health in post-conflict settings, as those conditions could worsen over time if left unattended and further undermine development outcomes. Referring to World Health Assembly resolution 77.3 on strengthening mental health and psychosocial support before, during and after armed conflicts, natural and human-caused disasters and health and other emergencies, the Committee underscored that an increased focus on the management of mental health systems and leadership was required, in addition to the building of strong and resilient institutions that could support the delivery of community-based E/2025/44 E/C.16/2025/9 24/26 25-06882 solutions over the long term. A World Health Organization report on building back better contained practical examples of how better-quality and more sustainable mental health systems had been built in many emergency-affected areas despite challenging circumstances. 69. Given the significant implications for governance and institution-building, the Committee was of the view that approaches to mental health and psychosocial support needed to become structural elements of peacebuilding efforts. It was also critical to address the mental health and social needs of post-conflict populations in order to prevent future conflicts, provide a framework for societies to recover and build sustainable peace. Healing the conflicts within individuals could help them to resolve the conflicts around them. 70.",

It was also critical to address the mental health and social needs of post-conflict populations in order to prevent future conflicts, provide a framework for societies to recover and build sustainable peace. Healing the conflicts within individuals could help them to resolve the conflicts around them. 70. Mental health interventions in conflict-affected countries could draw on a variety of methods, including psychosocial support, training, creative art therapy, psychoeducation and in-person and remote counselling, in situations where they are found to be beneficial. At the same time, mental health support for affected populations needed to go beyond individual mental health and psychosocial support to include interventions that strengthened community self-help, as well as support and advocacy for security and protection, adequate humanitarian aid, access to basic services, including basic health services, and livelihood support. 71. The Committee concluded with a number of recommendations for building more effective and efficient mental health systems in post-conflict countries, including at the local level. They included ensuring access to quality and affordable mental health services, implementing inclusive policies, providing training for mental health providers, integrating mental healthcare into existing systems, and for all actors to work across sectors to address the determinants of mental health. Strengthened information systems, evidence and research on mental health in post-conflict settings, including additional longitudinal studies, were needed to improve understanding of treatment and to establish effective mental health and psychosocial support programmes. E/2025/44 E/C.16/2025/9 25-06882 25/26 Chapter IV Future work of the Committee 72. The Committee will continue to align its work programme with the needs and priorities established by the Economic and Social Council, with a view to contributing effectively to the deliberations of the Council and assisting it in the performance of its functions. At its twenty-fifth session, the Committee will work on the theme that was adopted for the 2026 session of the Council and the high-level political forum on sustainable development and prepare policy recommendations on the governance and institutional aspects of that issue. 73. The Committee reaffirmed that the principles of effective governance for sustainable development, endorsed by the Council in its resolution 2018/12, continued to provide a useful cross-cutting and interconnected framework for its work. Subnational perspectives could also be a cross-cutting component of the Committee\u2019s future policy analysis. Similarly, in preparation for and during the next session, the Committee could consider pursuing interdisciplinary approaches to the items on its agenda. Its analysis of problems would be accompanied by actionable advice on policy solutions. 74. The Committee recommended continuation of the practice of organizing informal intersessional working groups to lay the groundwork for its next session, bearing in mind the need to produce technical and expert analysis, assessments and policy recommendations to inform efforts to implement the 2030 Agenda, as stipulated in General Assembly resolution 72/305. 75. The ongoing contribution of observers was welcomed. Further attention could be given to improving interaction with observers from all regions, for example, through expanded member engagement with academic networks and communities of practice on specific agenda items during the intersessional period. 76. The Committee recommended continued engagement with the other subsidiary bodies of the Economic and Social Council and other processes, as well as the United Nations system, with a view to promoting links and informing the integrated view of the Council.

During its consideration of all communications, including the replies of Governments thereon, and its consideration of the question of whether any of those appeared to reveal a consistent pattern of injustice and discriminatory practices against women and girls, the Working Group expressed its concern about: (a) Violence against women and girls, such as domestic violence, rape, including gang rape and marital rape, incest and other forms of sexual violence, torture, trafficking in women and girls and harmful practices, such as female genital mutilation and child and forced marriage, and their adverse effects on the full enjoyment by women and girls of their human rights and fundamental freedoms; (b) Violations of the right of women to health, including sexual and reproductive health and rights, as stipulated in the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, as well as lack of access to comprehensive healthcare services, including for mental healthcare, maternal care, menstrual hygiene and contraceptive options; (c) The continued existence of legislation and/or practices in many areas that discriminated against women and girls or having the effect of discriminating against women and girls, the ineffective or inadequate implementation of existing laws aimed at protecting and promoting the human rights of women and girls and addressing persistent inequalities, as well as the lack of such laws, notwithstanding States\u2019 international obligations; (d) Discrimination and violence against women and girls in vulnerable situations, including women belonging to religious and ethnic groups and E/2025/27 E/CN.6/2025/19 16/21 25-05510 minorities, those with disabilities, those living in poverty and rural areas, Indigenous women, migrant and refugee women, and internally displaced women and girls, and targeted attacks on educational settings, hospitals and healthcare facilities where women and girls are most affected, including in conflict zones and disaster-affected areas; (e) Torture, violence, harassment, including judicial harassment, and arbitrary detention and arrest of women human rights defenders, some of which also target their family members, their activities and their lawyers; (f) Abuse of power, including in cases in which sexual and gender-based violence is perpetrated by law enforcement personnel, cruel and degrading treatment, including forced confessions and forced disappearances, as well as discrimination against women in legal and judicial proceedings based on gender stereotypes and sexist attitudes that undermine the credibility of women\u2019s testimonies, in particular in cases involving rape, domestic violence and sexual assault; (g) The failure by some States to adequately exercise due diligence in order to prevent all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls, and to effectively investigate and prosecute such crimes, punish perpetrators and provide sufficient protection and assistance to victims and survivors, especially in disadvantaged communities and in confli",

The Working Group expressed appreciation for the cooperation extended by the Governments that had submitted replies or clarifying observations with regard to the communications received, recognizing their importance. Expressing concern about the continuing gap between the number of communications and the number of replies received, the Working Group urges all Governments that had not done so to make such submissions in the future, as their cooperation is essential for fulfilling the Working Group\u2019s mandate. From the replies received, the Working Group was encouraged to note that most Governments had provided explanations of their positions, carried out investigations into the allegations made and/or taken measures, such as improving the enforcement of existing legislation, introducing programmes and services to better protect and assist women and girls, including those who were victims of violence, investigating, prosecuting and punishing perpetrators of violence and making efforts to guarantee the full enjoyment of human rights by women and girls, in accordance with international human rights law and relevant international standards. The Working Group, however, remained concerned about the adequacy and effectiveness of these measures, in particular in addressing the systemic and widespread nature of violations, and emphasized the need for stronger implementation and monitoring of existing frameworks and providing victim support systems.

The President opened the first regular session of the Executive Board of 2025 by congratulating the new Bureau members. He expressed appreciation to the Bureau members who had served in 2024 and noted that he looked forward to working with the Executive Board in providing UNICEF with guidance and support in its efforts to achieve meaningful results for children around the world. 4. The President noted that 2025 would be an important year for UNICEF as it prepared to finalize its Strategic Plan for the period 2026\u20132029. The Board would hear an update on the Plan\u2019s development at the first regular session, review a draft at the annual session and consider endorsement at the second regular session.

The Executive Director highlighted the importance of innovative financing and private sector engagement, noting that National Committee contributions now accounted for more than 50 per cent of UNICEF regular resources.

To this end, UNICEF was implementing a new anti-fraud and corruption policy and adopting a notification framework for resource partners. 9. The Executive Director outlined key priorities for the new Strategic Plan, including driving results through focus, scale and impact while addressing immediate humanitarian needs and building community resilience. She highlighted the Vaccine Independence Initiative as an example of the vital role of effective partnership and noted that between 2020 and 2024, the Initiative had supported more than 100 countries with a throughput of over $1.7 billion in essential supplies for children, which had included nearly 1 billion doses of vaccines. 10. The Executive Director highlighted the organization\u2019s renewed strategic emphasis on reaching the most vulnerable children, including the 240 million children with disabilities worldwide.

She noted progress in implementing the Disability Inclusion Policy and Strategy launched in 2023. The Executive Director also highlighted the commitment of UNICEF to girls\u2019 rights and agency, noting that programming across all major sectors explicitly focused on adolescent girls and that the organization was increasing its efforts to work with Governments and partners to ensure that girls were not left behind. 11. The Executive Director said that UNICEF estimated that more than 213 million children in 146 countries and territories would need humanitarian assistance in 2025. She highlighted that in 2024, nearly 50 per cent of humanitarian funding received by UNICEF went to only five emergencies due to earmarking. She emphasized the urgent need to reverse that trend by increasing the proportion of regular resources and flexible humanitarian funding. She stressed that all children had the same rights under international law and must have access to principled humanitarian action, regardless of location. 12. The Executive Director concluded by restating the mission of UNICEF and thanking those present for their collaboration and insights. 13. The President thanked the Executive Director for her remarks and opened the floor for general national statements. 14. A Vice-President of the Executive Board, speaking on behalf of the Executive Board Bureau, extended gratitude to the Executive Director for her insightful opening statement and recognized the extraordinary efforts of UNICEF personnel across headquarters and field operations. The Vice-President commended achievements in 2024, particularly in addressing the needs of vulnerable children amid escalating humanitarian crises, while noting that 2024 was one of the worst years on record for children in conflict, with over 473 million children living in conflict-affected areas. 15. A group of 31 delegations emphasized the importance of the 2024 Quadrennial Comprehensive Policy Review in providing a vital framework to accelerate progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals. The group called upon entities to include a chapter in their strategic plans defining their comparative advantages within the United Nations development system. They further recognized that reliable and sufficient funding was essential and welcomed the new funding compact. In response, the Executive Director acknowledged the importance of cooperation with United Nations agencies, emphasizing that joint programming should be strategic and purposeful to increase overall capacity and coordination. E/2025/34 (Part I) E/ICEF/2025/7 (Part I) 5/24 25-02116 16. A group of eight delegations highlighted the UNICEF 2024 State of the World\u2019s Children report, which had identified three mega-trends: demographic shifts, climate and environmental crises, and frontier technologies. The group emphasized the report\u2019s relevance to the African region, where the number of children was expected to reach 890 million by 2050. The group also expressed concern about the learning crisis for children worldwide, particularly African children, and the risk of squandering potential demographic dividends. The group noted that the new Strategic Plan and the strategy on the UNICEF contribution to Africa\u2019s development agendas would be important tools for both the implementation of the 2030 and the 2063 development agendas and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which provided the legal framework for the work of UNICEF.

Unless otherwise mentioned, it covers the period from April 2024 to March 2025. A/AC.109/2025/18 25-04657 2/6 I. Introduction 1. The General Assembly, in paragraph 2 of its resolution 79/113 of 4 December 2024, considered it important to continue and expand its efforts to ensure the widest possible dissemination of information on decolonization, with particular emphasis on the options for self-determination available for the peoples of the Non-Self- Governing Territories. To that end, it requested the Department of Global Communications, through the United Nations information centres in the relevant regions, to actively engage and seek new and innovative ways to disseminate material to the Non-Self-Governing Territories. In paragraph 3 of the same resolution, the Assembly requested the Secretary-General to further enhance the information provided on the United Nations decolonization website and to continue to include the full series of reports of the regional seminars on decolonization, the statements and scholarly papers presented at those seminars and links to the full series of reports of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. It also stressed that the Department of Global Communications and the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs continue to be jointly responsible for maintaining and enhancing the United Nations decolonization website. In paragraph 4, the Assembly requested the Department of Global Communications to continue its efforts to update web-based information on the assistance programmes available to the Non-Self-Governing Territories. In paragraph 5, it requested the Department of Global Communications and the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs to implement the recommendations of the Special Committee and to continue their efforts to take measures through all of the media available, including publications, radio, television, the Internet and social media, to give publicity to the work of the United Nations in the field of decolonization. 2. In implementing that mandate, the Department of Global Communications worked closely with the Decolonization Unit of the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, among other relevant United Nations offices and entities, and it will continue to do so. 3. The present report, prepared in response to the above-mentioned resolution, covers the period from April 2024 to March 2025, unless stated otherwise. II. 2024 Caribbean regional seminar on the implementation of the Fourth International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism 4. The Special Committee held its 2024 Caribbean seminar in Caracas from 14 to 16 May, within the framework of the Fourth International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism (2021\u20132030). The theme of the seminar was \u201cPursuing goals and addressing needs of the Non-Self-Governing Territories\u201d. 5. An information officer was assigned by the Department of Global Communications to cover the event. The information officer issued daily press releases, which were disseminated through the Department\u2019s various platforms. III. Coverage of issues before the General Assembly 6. The Department issued a total of 37 press releases, in English and French, covering meetings and statements relating to the work of the United Nations on A/AC.109/2025/18 3/6 25-04657 decolonization, including by the General Assembly, its Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee) and the Special Committee. 7. The Department\u2019s Media Accreditation and Liaison Unit continued to provide journalists with information on meetings, events and activities related to the subject matter through media alerts, including media advisories on the work of the Special Committee.

The Unit\u2019s Media Documents Centre distributed statements and resolutions related to meetings of the General Assembly, the Fourth Committee and the Special Committee to journalists and members of the media covering the work of the United Nations on decolonization. A. United Nations websites and social media 9. The \u201cGlobal issues\u201d section of the United Nations website, maintained by the Department\u2019s Web Services Section, continued to feature the issue of decolonization in the Organization\u2019s six official languages (www.un.org/en/global- issues/decolonization). The pages on the topic received a total of 183,247 views, a 2.5 per cent increase over the previous reporting period. 10. In the \u201cObservances\u201d section of the United Nations website, the pages for the International Week of Solidarity with the Peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories (25\u201331 May; www.un.org/en/observances/non-self-governing-week) in the six official languages were viewed 10,449 times. 11. The main United Nations social media accounts, with more than 73 million collective followers, promoted the subject of decolonization in the six official languages, as well as in Hindi, Kiswahili and Portuguese. The subjects covered ranged from the observance of various occasions, such as the International Week of Solidarity with the Peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories, to events and related meetings. Posts directed traffic to United Nations web pages on decolonization and supported the Organization\u2019s programme to ensure diverse audiences could be reached with detailed and current information about the work of the Organization in the area of decolonization. 12. The Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs continued to maintain and update the \u201cUnited Nations and Decolonization\u201d website in the six official languages (www.un.org/dppa/decolonization). However, updates could not be completed in the fourth quarter of 2024 because of a 50 per cent reduction in administrative and operational capacity caused by measures taken in relation to the liquidity situation of the Organization. In 2024, the website had a total of 1,760,184 page views and 1,117,300 sessions, representing an increase of 14.6 per cent and 21.2 per cent, respectively, compared with 2023. The number of users totalled 574,434, a 0.82 per cent decrease compared with 2023. 13. The Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs continued to keep the public informed of activities relating to decolonization, in particular the activities of the Special Committee, the Fourth Committee, the Economic and Social Council and the General Assembly, through the \u201cUnited Nations and Decolonization\u201d website. 14. As part of the commitment under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls, and as the Special Committee on Decolonization has consistently stressed in its annual reports, the dedicated section on the website subtitled \u201cWomen in the Territories: Highlights\u201d was updated to provide information regarding the role, contributions and achievements of women in the Non-Self-Governing Territories and the process of decolonization. In addition, in support of the Data Strategy of the Secretary-General for Action by A/AC.109/2025/18 25-04657 4/6 Everyone, Everywhere, an infographic entitled \u201cUN decolonization in numbers\u201d highlighting key numbers in decolonization and an interactive timeline of all regional seminars were produced in the six official languages. B. United Nations News 15. United Nations News, operating in multiple languages, continued to produce multimedia stories and features on relevant issues, with each of the language units contributing distinct perspectives to the decolonization discussion. For example, the Portuguese Unit of United Nations News organized a special event to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the Carnation Revolution of Portugal. The event featured a dialogue with the Secretary-General and ambassadors from Portuguese-speaking countries in which that revolution\u2019s historical significance to the issue of decolonization was highlighted. The coverage of that event was widely shared across 44 international media outlets, including TV Globo (Brazil) and Cable News Network Portugal.",

The Visitors\u2019 Services Section in New York continued to share information on decolonization with United Nations visitors through its guided tours, including on the former role of the Trusteeship Council and the work of the Fourth Committee, as well A/AC.109/2025/18 5/6 25-04657 as on the progress made on decolonization over the decades in the light of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples of 1960. During the reporting period, 191,953 visitors took an in-person guided tour at United Nations Headquarters, and an additional 1,672 people took a virtual tour. 21. During the reporting period, 477 visitors took an in-person Black history tour at United Nations Headquarters. The tour provides a unique look at the Ark of Return permanent memorial and highlights the contributions of people of African descent to the work of the United Nations in such fields as peace and security and human rights, with a special emphasis on decolonization. 22. The Visitors\u2019 Service at the United Nations Office at Geneva continued to introduce the theme of decolonization through a description of the mandate and past activities of the Trusteeship Council, reaching nearly 38,000 visitors. In parallel, the Visitors Service in Vienna continued to highlight the topic to its visitors during the general guided tours, when explaining the increase in United Nations membership over the years. The historical work of the Trusteeship Council was also presented to visitors participating in a lecture programme on the United Nations. In 2024, some 49,300 visitors participated in the guided tour and more than 2,700 participated in lecture programmes on various topics. 23. The Visitors Service at the United Nations Office at Nairobi also played a pivotal role in informing some 10,000 visitors about the subject through comprehensive briefings and detailed explanations that focused on the work of the Trusteeship Council and the act",

The Visitors Service at the United Nations Office at Nairobi also played a pivotal role in informing some 10,000 visitors about the subject through comprehensive briefings and detailed explanations that focused on the work of the Trusteeship Council and the activities of the Fourth Committee. In addition, the Service added Chinese to the list of languages in which offers its decolonization briefings, which were previously available in English only. It also continued to offer an insightful perspective on the historical context of decolonization in the region and to highlight the fact that 80 African countries have gained independence with the help of the United Nations. V. Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld Library 24. During the reporting period, the United Nations Digital Library, a digital repository developed and maintained by the Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld Library, recorded 851,810 new downloads of United Nations parliamentary and normative documents and publications relating directly to decolonization. 25. The Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld Library has digitized a collection of 11,700 historic United Nations parliamentary and normative documents and publications, spanning some 226,600 pages. Within that collection, there are 2,880 documents comprising 111,010 pages that pertain specifically to the subject of decolonization. During the reporting period, United Nations Headquarters analysed 85 parliamentary and normative documents and 285 entries for speeches, all relating to decolonization, and added them to the United Nations Digital Library and the Official Document System. Information services colleagues, who actively assisted researchers in their search for information on the topic, continue to carefully maintain two research guides on decolonization, namely, the guide on the documents of the Trusteeship Council (research.un.org/en/docs/tc/documents), which was viewed 24,784 times, and the documentation guide on decolonization, available in English (research.un.org/en/ docs/decolonization) and Spanish (research.un.org/es/docs/decolonization), which was viewed more than 3,500 times. 26. The Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld Library at Headquarters in New York continues to curate a large collection on the topic of decolonization that currently comprises 1,033 A/AC.109/2025/18 25-04657 6/6 electronic books, 5 electronic journals and more than 17,000 research articles, all sourced from a diverse array of small and large publishers. VI. United Nations information centres and services 27. The global network of 59 United Nations information centres continued to educate the public on the issue of decolonization through virtual and in-person briefings, guided tours and Model United Nations. On 24 January 2025, the People\u2019s Friendship University of Russia and the United Nations information centre in Moscow jointly organized an event to discuss key issues in the fight against colonialism and the role of the United Nation in that context. The discussion, which was devoted to the eightieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations, was held within the framework of a regularly held scholarly seminar entitled \u201cInternational law in the light of new challenges and threats\u201d. Some 100 experts, professors and undergraduate and graduate students from the Russian Federation and countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States attended the event in person and online. VII. Conclusions 28. The Department of Global Communications continued its efforts to cover and promote the issue of decolonization and to advance the goals of the Fourth International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism. The Department, in close collaboration with the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, leveraged its diverse multimedia and multilingual platforms to support the work of the Special Committee. The aim of this collaboration is to further the cause of decolonization and underscore the urgent need for the immediate and full implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples.",

As far as the obligations of Israel as an occupying Power in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, are concerned, I take note of the statement in the letter of the Permanent Representative to the effect that \u201cthe legislation enacted by the Knesset [see A/79/684-S/2024/892 for the full text of the unofficial translation by Israel from Hebrew] does not in any way undermine Israel\u2019s steadfast commitment to international law\u201d and that \u201cIsrael is committed to observing all the international legal obligations that are incumbent upon it, including those prescribed by the law of armed conflict\u201d. This statement is consistent with my identical letters to the President of the General Assembly and the President of the Security Council dated 9 December 2024 (A/79/684-S/2024/892), in which I stated that Israel, as the occupying Power in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, is bound by the rules of international humanitarian law concerning occupation, including those contained in the Regulations respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land (\u201cthe Hague Regulations\u201d) annexed to the Convention respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land of 18 October 1907 and the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949 (\u201cthe Fourth Geneva Convention\u201d). A/79/716 S/2025/18 25-00259 2/5 In the letter, I highlighted the key obligations of Israel vis-\u00e0-vis the Palestinian people and UNRWA in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and recalled that Israel may not invoke the provisions of its internal law, including the legislation mentioned above, as justification for its failure to perform those obligations. With respect to the part of the letter of the Permanent Representative that refers to the legal status of the Gaza Strip, while the International Court of Justice stated that it was \u201cof the view that the policies and practices contemplated by the request of the General Assembly do not include conduct by Israel in the Gaza Strip in response to the attack carried out against it by Hamas and other armed groups on 7 October 2023\u201d (Legal Consequences arising from the Policies and Practices of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, Advisory Opinion, 19 July 2024, para. 81), the Court did so in order to clarify that conduct by Israel in the Gaza Strip in response to the attack carried out against it by Hamas and other armed groups on 7 October 2023 was not within the scope of the request for an advisory opinion which the General Assembly made in its resolution 77/247 of 30 December 2022. The legal status of the Gaza Strip was addressed by the Court in a subsequent section of its Advisory Opinion. The Court thus concluded that it was \u201cof the view that Israel\u2019s withdrawal from the Gaza Strip has not entirely released it of its obligations under the law of occupation\u201d (para. 94 of the Advisory Opinion). Furthermore, the General Assembly, on 18 September 2024, adopted resolution ES-10/24, in which it referred to \u201cthe territory of the Gaza Strip, which constitutes an integral part of the Occupied Palestinian Territory\u201d, and, on 11 December 2024, adopted resolution ES-10/25 in which it referred to \u201cthe Occupied Palestinian Territory, namely in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem\u201d. In the light of the above, and as I mentioned in my identical letters dated 9 December 2024, Israel continues to occupy the Gaza Strip and is bound by the rules of international humanitarian law concerning occupation also with regard to the Gaza Strip.",

In the light of the above, and as I mentioned in my identical letters dated 9 December 2024, Israel continues to occupy the Gaza Strip and is bound by the rules of international humanitarian law concerning occupation also with regard to the Gaza Strip. I also take note of the statement in the letter of the Permanent Representative that \u201cIsrael has cooperated and coordinated with more than 40 [\u2026] actors [including United Nations agencies] to allow and facilitate the provision of necessary basic services and humanitarian assistance to the civilian population\u201d and that Israel \u201cstands ready to cooperate with international partners for the purpose of allowing and facilitating the continued free passage of humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza and reiterates that humanitarian needs should be put above political considerations\u201d. A number of United Nations entities other than UNRWA have been operating and will continue to operate in the Occupied Palestinian Territory to the extent possible and consistent with their mandates. However, this cannot replace UNRWA operations because of its unique mandate and the unique role it has played in providing services and assistance to Palestine refugees, including prior to the occupation of the Palestinian territory by Israel in 1967. In this regard, in my identical letters dated 9 December 2024, I highlighted the scale of activities that UNRWA has been carrying out in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, for millions of Palestine refugees, including an average of over 15,000 medical consultations per day and over 500,000 per month in Gaza despite the ongoing armed conflict in Gaza. However, it is not just the scale of activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory that makes UNRWA unique and irreplaceable. UNRWA has been carrying out activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory for more than 70 years. Following its establishment by the General Assembly in resolution 302 (IV) of 8 December 1949, UNRWA has been providing assistance to Palestine refugees in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, A/79/716 S/2025/18 3/5 25-00259 since 1950 and has thus accumulated unparalleled experience in providing assistance that is tailored to the specific needs of Palestine refugees. UNRWA is able to access Palestine refugees and swiftly provide the assistance they need, due to its personnel and infrastructure already being available across the Occupied Palestinian Territory to carry out its mandate. Its long-established and extensive presence has also enabled it to provide assistance to Palestine refugees as mandated by the Assembly across the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in East Jerusalem, in an effective and coordinated manner. Any cessation of UNRWA activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory would mean not only that millions of Palestine refugees who have been benefiting from UNRWA services and assistance would no longer be receiving them, but also that the Agency\u2019s long-established experience in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, its tailored assistance to Palestine refugees and its unparalleled access to Palestine refugees in the Occupied Palestinian Territory would be lost. It is in this sense that I say that there is currently no realistic alternative to UNRWA that could adequately provide the services and assistance required by Palestine refugees in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem. I recall, in this connection, that the General Assembly, in its resolution ES-10/25, affirmed that no organization could replace or substitute the Agency\u2019s capacity and mandate to serve Palestine refugees and civilians in urgent need of life-saving humanitarian assistance. As I mentioned in my identical letters dated 9 December 2024, in the event that UNRWA is compelled to cease its activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, Israel would be left to ensure that the range of services and assistance that UNRWA has been providing are provided in accordance with its obligations under international humanitarian law and international human rights law. While the competent United Nations entities are prepared to provide the necessary services and assistance to the Palestinian people to the extent possible and consistent with their mandates, this must not be viewed as releasing Israel from its obligations under international law vis-\u00e0-vis the Palestinian people in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem.",

I would also like to take this opportunity to address the reference made in the letter from the Permanent Representative to \u201cthe significant national security risks posed by Hamas\u2019s pervasive infiltration of UNRWA and the latter\u2019s persistent refusal to remedy this intolerable situation\u201d. Despite the explanations that I and the UNRWA Commissioner-General have given in the past on this matter, including to the General Assembly, I am concerned by the fact that attempts have continued to be made to disseminate misunderstandings and misrepresentations. I believe that it is in the interest of the United Nations to address these allegations, which continue to be very damaging to the United Nations in general and constitute an obstacle for UNRWA to operate effectively in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. I call on the Government of Israel to refrain from such misrepresentations. As mentioned above, the General Assembly established UNRWA and, as such, UNRWA has been operating at all times under the supervision of the Assembly. For this purpose, the Commissioner-General of UNRWA regularly provides updates to the Assembly on the mandated activities of UNRWA (see, for example, the latest annual report of the Commissioner-General to the Assembly (A/79/13)), including on the neutrality of UNRWA (ibid., letter of transmittal from the UNRWA Commissioner- General). UNRWA will continue to update the Assembly on this important matter. I wish to recall that, upon receiving allegations of breaches of UNRWA neutrality, I appointed, on 5 February 2024, an Independent Review Group on UNRWA, which issued its final report on 20 April 2024. The Review Group, inter alia, A/79/716 S/2025/18 25-00259 4/5 concluded that \u201cUNRWA has established a significant number of mechanisms and procedures to ensure compliance with the humanitarian principles, with emphasis on the principle of neutrality, and that it possesses a more developed approach to neutrality than other similar [United Nations] or [non-governmental organization] entities\u201d, while also \u201cidentif[ying] several measures to help UNRWA address its neutrality challenges in eight critical areas requiring immediate improvement\u201d. I am, alongside UNRWA, committed to fully implementing the review\u2019s recommendations, with the support of Member States. In this regard, I welcome resolution ES-10/25 in which the General Assembly recognized the necessity to further strengthen and sustain the Agency\u2019s compliance with the recommendations of the Independent Review (Colonna Report) through increased contributions, including from the assessed regular budget of the United Nations. I also welcome the Security Council press statement of 30 October 2024 in which the members of the Council \u201cwelcomed the Secretary- General\u2019s and the Agency\u2019s commitment to fully implement [the] recommendations [of the Independent Review Group] and called for their accelerated implementation, in line with UNRWA\u2019s commitment to the principle of neutrality\u201d (SC/15874). UNRWA has immediately begun implementing the recommendations, supported by a high-level action plan that is regularly updated, with progress shared transparently, including on the UNRWA website. I also wish to recall that UNRWA engages with Israel with regard to allegations raised against UNRWA and its personnel and takes the steps necessary to investigate those allegations in accordance with the Organization\u2019s regulations, rules and policies and in line with the status, privileges and immunities of the United Nations. In this regard, UNRWA has responded to every allegation that has been raised by the Government of Israel against personnel of UNRWA regarding possible political activity that may be against the interest of the United Nations or connections to acts of terror, based on its policy of zero tolerance for activities of this nature. This is demonstrated by the actions taken by UNRWA following allegations that its personnel may have been involved in the attacks of 7 October 2023. Upon receiving the allegations, immediate administrative steps were taken. I immediately referred the allegations to the Office of Internal Oversight Services for investigation under the Organization\u2019s regulatory framework.",

Upon receiving the allegations, immediate administrative steps were taken. I immediately referred the allegations to the Office of Internal Oversight Services for investigation under the Organization\u2019s regulatory framework. Such actions were consistent with the history of UNRWA engagement with the Government of Israel, whereby it has been responsive to allegations raised by the Government of wrongdoing by UNRWA personnel. In order for UNRWA to conduct a thorough investigation into the allegations received, there is a need for mutual cooperation between UNRWA and Israel. In this regard, UNRWA has shared with the Government of Israel a list of its personnel and has informed it of suspected military operations in and around UNRWA premises in Gaza. Moreover, UNRWA has repeatedly requested, in its letters to the Government of Israel, that the relevant authorities of Israel share evidence and other information with UNRWA of breaches of UNRWA neutrality in order that it may proceed with disciplinary processes, including dismissal, under its regulatory framework. To date, no response has been received from the Government of Israel to such requests. Furthermore, where requested, UNRWA has been prepared to facilitate the Government\u2019s investigation or prosecutorial process against those alleged to have engaged in wrongdoing, in accordance with the legal framework applicable to the Organization. To date, the Government has neither sought UNRWA assistance or cooperation in any investigation or prosecutorial process that it may have conducted, nor provided sufficient evidence to UNRWA to substantiate its allegations against UNRWA personnel. UNRWA and the Government of Israel have had a cooperative arrangement in the past, and I invite the Government to resume this level of engagement and cooperation. I recall, in this regard, that the General Assembly has, in its resolution A/79/716 S/2025/18 5/5 25-00259 ES-10/25, reiterated its demand that Israel comply without delay with all its legal obligations under international law, including, inter alia, to take all necessary and effective measures to ensure, in full cooperation with the United Nations, the unhindered provision at scale by all concerned of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance. I should be grateful if you would circulate the present letter as a document of the General Assembly, under agenda items 34, 35, 49 and 72 (b), and of the Security Council.

The Security Council subsequently approved an extension of the deadline to 30 April 2025, to allow for further assessment of the recommendations of the independent strategic review. The purpose of the independent strategic review was to enable the potential hybrid implementation, from 1 July 2025, of the framework established by Security Council resolution 2719 (2023) for the African Union Support and Stabilization Mission in Somalia (AUSSOM) from within existing resources made available by the rightsizing of UNSOS. I am pleased to transmit the report on the independent strategic review, which was co-chaired by Maman Sidikou (Niger) and Neil Cole (South Africa) and supported by a joint technical team from the African Union Commission and the United Nations Secretariat (see annex). The authors of the report on the independent strategic review identified an overall cost reduction of $61.6 million within the existing UNSOS resource ceiling. These reductions will be achieved through efficiency gains, optimization and reduced support activities where there is a low or medium risk to operational effectiveness. The $61.6 million in cost reductions identified by the independent strategic review would keep the overall cost of UNSOS and AUSSOM at the level of the previous overall cost of UNSOS and the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS), as recommended in the 26 November 2024 report produced jointly with the Chairperson of the African Union Commission. However, the reductions identified were not sufficient to meet the requirement set out by the Security Council, in its resolution 2767 (2024), that the hybrid implementation of the framework established A/79/907 S/2025/268 25-06872 2/24 by resolution 2719 (2023) for AUSSOM from 1 July 2025, including access to United Nations assessed contributions not exceeding 75 per cent of the annual total budget of AUSSOM, be undertaken within existing resources made available by the rightsizing of UNSOS. With a view to closing this gap, extensive consultations were held with the African Union, resulting in an agreement to reduce costs by a further $63.3 million beyond those identified by the independent strategic review. These additional reductions include maintaining the current troop reimbursement rate of $828, rather than increasing it to $1,000 as initially proposed; eliminating funding from assessed contributions for death and disability compensation; rationalizing military aviation and civilian air support capabilities; funding the Mine Action Service component through potential voluntary contributions, rather than assessed contributions; and committing to align contingent- owned equipment with the new authorized strength levels. In accordance with Security Council resolution 2767 (2024), these figures exclude possible one-off additional resource requirements for enabling the reconfiguration of UNSOS operations and the realignment of AUSSOM during phase 1 of the Mission. However, the exact costs associated with these additional requirements will be determined after detailed joint planning. The cost reductions proposed in the independent strategic review and the outcome of the further consultations between the African Union and the United Nations (amounting to a total of $124.9 million) reflect balanced and, in some cases, difficult compromises made to preserve the hard-won gains that have been made thus far. These reductions are considered operationally feasible and will entail no additional costs for Member States. In the light of this, I urge the Council to ensure sustainable, predictable and adequate financing for AUSSOM, as this Mission remains essential to supporting Somalia at this critical stage of its transition.",

These reductions are considered operationally feasible and will entail no additional costs for Member States. In the light of this, I urge the Council to ensure sustainable, predictable and adequate financing for AUSSOM, as this Mission remains essential to supporting Somalia at this critical stage of its transition. I should be grateful if you would bring the present letter and its annex to the attention of the members of the General Assembly and the Security Council and circulate it as a document of the Assembly and the Council. (Signed) Ant\u00f3nio Guterres A/79/907 S/2025/268 3/24 25-06872 Annex [Original: English] Report of the independent strategic review of the United Nations Support Office in Somalia pursuant to Security Council resolution 2767 (2024) Introduction 1. Following the adoption of Security Council resolution 2245 (2015), the United Nations Support Office in Somalia (UNSOS) replaced the United Nations Support Office for the African Union Mission in Somalia (UNSOA), which had been established in 2009 pursuant to resolution 1863 (2009). Over the years, UNSOS has continued to provide logistical support to the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), which was later reconfigured into the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS) and, more recently, the African Union Support and Stabilization Mission in Somalia (AUSSOM). The Security Council authorization for AUSSOM is contained in resolution 2767 (2024), which is for an initial period of 12 months, starting from 1 January 2025. 2. The Security Council, in its resolution 2767 (2024), requested UNSOS to continue to provide, in accordance with the existing assessed financial and administrative arrangements, a logistical support package for: (a) the deployment of up to 12,626 uniformed personnel, inclusive of 1,040 police personnel, to AUSSOM until 30 June 2025 for phase 1 of the mission; (b) the deployment of up to 11,826 uniformed personnel, inclusive of 680 police personnel, to AUSSOM from 1 July until 31 December 2025 for the first six months of phase two; (c) 85 AUSSOM civilians, to support the military and police tasks of AUSSOM and enhance coordination between the United Nations, African Union and Somalia; and (d) the United Nations Transitional Assistance Mission in Somalia (UNTMIS) on a cost-recovery basis. 3. The Council also requested UNSOS, in line with paragraphs 2 (f) and (g) of resolution 2245 (2015), to continue to support up to 20,900 personnel from the Somali National Army or Somalia National Police force, on joint or coordinated operations with AUSSOM until 31 December 2025 in full compliance with the human rights due diligence policy on United Nations support to non-United Nations security forces, through the provision of food and water, fuel, transportation, tents and in-theatre medical evacuation on an exceptional basis for joint Somalia National Army operations, with funding to be provided from an appropriate United Nations trust fund. 4. In addition, the Security Council requested UNSOS and UNTMIS, in full consultation with the Federal Government of Somalia, to continue to support Somalia in planning for and developing its sovereign capacity in logistical support, in line with paragraph 29 of resolution 2687 (2023). The Secretary-General was further requested to continue United Nations support to Somalia with training, equipment and mentorship to counter the threat of improvised explosive devices. The United Nations was also encouraged to consult with the Somalia Explosive Management Authority and other relevant agencies in Somalia, as well as the country\u2019s bilateral training partners, to ensure coordination and alignment. A/79/907 S/2025/268 25-06872 4/24 5. In mandating UNSOS to continue to provide the logistical package in accordance with existing arrangements, the Security Council also took note of the report produced jointly by the Secretary-General and the Chairperson of the African Union Commission, in consultation with Somalia and international stakeholders, that the Secretary-General submitted to the Council on 26 November 2024 pursuant to resolution 2748 (2024). In their joint report, the Secretary-General and Chairperson of the African Union Commission set out the overall mission design for AUSSOM and options for financing it. They also recommended a \u201chybrid implementation\u201d model, under which UNSOS would continue to be financed in accordance with existing arrangements, while AUSSOM would be financed by the framework under resolution 2719 (2023), that is, through access to United Nations assessed contributions not exceeding 75 per cent of the annual total budget of AUSSOM. 6.",

In the light of the joint report, the Security Council, in paragraph 44 of resolution 2767 (2024), requested the Secretary-General to carry out and submit to the Security Council and the General Assembly, by 1 April 2025, an independent strategic review of UNSOS, to enable the potential hybrid implementation of the framework established by resolution 2719 (2023) to AUSSOM from 1 July 2025 from within existing resources made available by the rightsizing of UNSOS, including the development of detailed recommendations for the optimization of the efficiency, performance, management and structures of UNSOS in the context of the authorization of AUSSOM, and an assessment of the potential operational implications for support to the activities of AUSSOM, as well as proposed mitigations. 7. In taking note of the options for financing AUSSOM set out in the joint report, as well as the proposed new mission specific reimbursement rate for the mission\u2019s troop- and police-contributing countries, the Security Council also requested the Secretary-General to accelerate preparations towards the implementation of the framework established by resolution 2719 (2023) to AUSSOM, including, jointly with the Chairperson of the African Union Commission, mobilizing the necessary extra- budgetary resources from the international community, in accordance with the principles of predictability, flexibility and sustainability. 8. In addition, it requested the Secretary-General to submit to the Security Council, by 1 May 2025, a report detailing the progress made in preparations for the implementation of the framework established by resolution 2719 (2023) to AUSSOM under the \u201chybrid implementation\u201d set out in the joint report, taking into account the strategic review requested in paragraph 44 of resolution 2767 (2024) to enable delivery within existing resources made available by the rightsizing of UNSOS. 1 Background and approach to the review 9. In January 2025, the Secretary-General and the Chairperson of the African Union Commission appointed Ambassador Maman Sidikou (Niger) and Neil Cole (South Africa) to co-lead the independent strategic review of UNSOS, supported by a joint technical team from the African Union Commission and the United Nations Secretariat. In February and March, the joint team conducted field visits and held consultations with key stakeholders in Addis Ababa, Baidoa, Mogadishu and New __________________ 1 In accordance with resolution 2767 (2024), the report should include: (a) timelines and actions taken for the necessary deliberations and approvals by relevant United Nations bodies in accordance with their mandates and the Charter of the United Nations; (b) the status of the 25 per cent of the annual total budget of AUSSOM to be jointly mobilized by the African Union and United Nations from the international community as extra-budgetary resources; and, (c) an update on preparations for the orderly and practical application of the \u201chybrid implementation\u201d of the framework established by resolution 2719 (2023) to AUSSOM from 1 July 2025.

With the support of successive African Union missions, Somalia has made significant progress over the past decade and has achieved key milestones on its journey from conflict to reconstruction, including on the political, security and economic fronts. Successive African Union missions in Somalia and the provision of uniformed and civilian personnel by African Union member States have made invaluable contributions to and sacrifices for Somalia and significantly contributed to the country\u2019s State-building efforts by degrading Al-Shabaab, providing security, developing the Somali security forces and supporting peace and reconciliation.",

      "text": "luding on the political, security and economic fronts. Successive African Union missions in Somalia and the provision of uniformed and civilian personnel by African Union member States have made invaluable contributions to and sacrifices for Somalia and significantly contributed to the country\u2019s State-building efforts by degrading Al-Shabaab, providing security, developing the Somali security forces and supporting peace and reconciliation. The United Nations supported these efforts through UNSOA and UNSOS, with Member States contributing more than $8 billion in assessed contributions since 2009. Similarly, the European Union has committed over \u20ac2.6 billion to African Union missions in Somalia since 2007. There is clear resolve among international partners, which have also contributed considerably through voluntary contributions and bilateral assistance, to continue supporting Somalia in consolidating these hard-won gains. 11. The review team took a careful, comprehensive and consultative approach in its efforts to maximize efficiencies in UNSOS and enable the hybrid implementation of the framework established by resolution 2719 (2023) for AUSSOM. Efforts to achieve predictable and sustainable funding for AUSSOM troop reimbursements must be balanced with the efficacy of UNSOS support to AUSSOM. In that regard, it is worth noting that the $499.8 million budget of UNSOS for 2024/25 was based on the funding requirements of ATMIS and AUSSOM. Accordingly, reductions in UNSOS resources and capacity had to be carefully considered against the potential degradation of support to the military operations. Moreover, while the focus of the review was on UNSOS and AUSSOM, the essential support that both missions provide to the Somali security forces also required careful attention. It was important to ensure that efficiency considerations, while important, did not inadvertently undermine an effective transition to the national actors. 12. Accordingly, the principles that guided the review were the need to identify efficiencies and cost reductions while ensuring support to the security transition to the Somali security forces and also enabling an effective AUSSOM through a capable and efficient UNSOS. In line with those principles, the review team sought to identify (a) costs that UNSOS could reduce while maintaining effectiveness; (b) what UNSOS and AUSSOM could do differently together to reduce costs, including through greater efficiency efforts; and (c) what AUSSOM could do to enhance efficiency and effectiveness, while remaining focused on supporting the final transition to the Somali security forces. Owing to the compressed timeline, the review was focused on __________________ 2 President of the Federal Government of Somalia, Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Minister of State for Defence, National Security Advisor, Chief of Defence Forces and Police Commissioner. 3 Chairperson of the African Union Commission, Commissioner for Political Affairs, Peace and Security, Head of the Peace Support Operations Division and Special Representative and Deputy Special Representative of the Chairperson of the African Union Commission. 4 China, France, Italy, Japan, Qatar, Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Sweden, T\u00fcrkiye, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and United States of America, as well as the European Union and the United Nations Office to the African Union. A/79/907 S/2025/268 25-06872 6/24 UNSOS. Nonetheless, continued efforts in all three of the aforementioned areas could help maximize the efficiencies and performance of both UNSOS and AUSSOM. 13. The review team notes that the joint report included a recommendation that the hybrid implementation model be implemented within the combined budgets of UNSOS and ATMIS, amounting to approximately $655 million. Nevertheless, the Security Council, in its resolution 2767 (2024), decided that the hybrid implementation model should be implemented within the existing resources available for UNSOS, amounting to $499.8 million. UNSOS, the review team further notes, is already a light footprint mission with the lowest mission support to uniformed personnel ratio of all United Nations peacekeeping operations, excluding the additional support the mission provides to the Somali security forces. In that regard, while there were some opportunities for efficiencies, much of the cost reductions in the UNSOS budget entailed operational implications that required risk mitigation measures. 14. Moreover, the review team notes that the withdrawal of UNTMIS by 31 October 2026 will put upward pressure on the budget of UNSOS in the future.",

Moreover, the review team notes that the withdrawal of UNTMIS by 31 October 2026 will put upward pressure on the budget of UNSOS in the future. Many categories of support for the work of the United Nations in Somalia rely on financial support from UNTMIS, including the United Nations Guard Unit at a cost of $16 million per year,5 local cost-sharing for security, facilities and infrastructure and field offices, and human rights due diligence policy monitoring and mitigation work carried out by the mission to facilitate UNSOS support to AUSSOM and the Somali security forces. 6 Many of those functions and costs will inevitably become the responsibility of UNSOS. African Union Support and Stabilization Mission in Somalia requirements 15. Under the AUSSOM concept of operations, the authorized strength of the mission is 11,911 personnel, comprising 11,826 uniformed personnel (11,146 military and 680 police personnel) and 85 civilians. The estimated budget for AUSSOM from 1 July 2025 to 30 June 2026 is $190.2 million and includes the following: (a) military, inclusive of contingents, mission and force headquarters staff ($152.9 million); (b) police, inclusive of police leadership, formed police units and individual police officers ($14.6 million); (c) international civilian personnel ($14.0 million); (d) operational costs covering official travel, facilities and infrastructure, ground transportation, information technology, medical, other services and supplies ($3.9 million); other support, including quick-impact projects ($0.8 million); and (e) thematic programmatic activities ($4.0 million). 16. The UNSOS budget provides for the delivery of a comprehensive non-lethal logistics package to AUSSOM, including reimbursement of contingent-owned equipment, as well as the provision of support in such critical operational areas as aviation, medical, mine action, life support and facilities and infrastructure. As pointed out in the joint report, this still leaves the sustainability and predictability of troop reimbursements to be addressed. While uniformed personnel conduct peace enforcement operations against Al Shabaab, incurring a high number of fatalities and __________________ 5 It is likely that the United Nations Guard Unit will remain in place through the liquidation period of UNTMIS but may have to transition to UNSOS after the liquidation. The United Nations Guard Unit was established by a decision of the Security Council and, therefore, a Council decision will be required in order for the transition to be made. Consideration could also be given to converting this third-layer of the security architecture to a private security company, as has been done with other missions, and thereby achieving some savings. 6 Human rights due diligence policy mitigation may also need to be absorbed into the UNSOS budget from the 2026/27 period, but it would need to be executed by another entity in order to avoid a conflict of interest. A/79/907 S/2025/268 7/24 25-06872 casualties, reimbursements for such personnel have lagged since November 2022, resulting in arrears of approximately $100 million. 17. In consultations held in the course of the review, the African Union Commission indicated that the total annual requirements for AUSSOM amounted to $190.2 million (see para. 15). Noting that the African Union had committed to financing the costs of the civilian personnel in the mission, as indicated in the joint report, the total requirements for AUSSOM would amount to $176.2 million, inclusive of death and disability benefits. 18. Consistent with the practice in peacekeeping missions, budgeting for AUSSOM and the reimbursements for military and police personnel of formed units deployed to the mission will take into account the actual deployment of these uniformed personnel in the mission area. Troop reimbursements will also be made in accordance with the relevant deductions for absent or non-functional contingent-owned equipment, as set out in General Assembly resolution 67/261, if any. Should there be instances of sexual abuse and exploitation, the policies on troop and police personnel reimbursement, as set out in General Assembly resolutions 65/289, 66/264, 70/286, will also apply. In addition to troop reimbursements, reimbursements for death and disability for these two categories of personnel will be budgeted at the average expenditure for death and disability reimbursements over the three",

In addition to troop reimbursements, reimbursements for death and disability for these two categories of personnel will be budgeted at the average expenditure for death and disability reimbursements over the three previous years, or approximately $5 million based on the current African Union rate for such reimbursements. 19. In applying the framework established by resolution 2719 (2023) for AUSSOM troop and police reimbursement, including for death and disability, 75 per cent of that reimbursement would come from the assessed budget, amounting to approximately $132.1 million, while the remaining 25 per cent, or approximately $44.1 million, will need to be jointly mobilized as extra-budgetary resources. Review of the United Nations Support Office in Somalia 20. The review of UNSOS for efficiency gains, optimization and cost reductions was done collaboratively by the United Nations and the African Union. Each section of UNSOS presented ideas to achieve savings within the 2024/25 budget ($499.8 million) to the review team and its co-chairs. In addition, teams from UNSOS and AUSSOM held technical meetings to jointly review implications and mitigation measures. The review was focused on identifying possible reductions in existing operational costs ($294.5 million) and the current staffing structure ($93.2 million) of UNSOS. A breakdown of the financial resources for UNSOS, as set out in the 2025/26 budget proposal, is provided in enclosure 1. 21. The review team took a risk-based approach to assessing potential reductions, operational implications and mitigating measures. Through this process, AUSSOM and UNSOS identified a list of measures that would result in a cost reduction of $43.2 million, or 15 per cent of the approved operating costs, in the following areas: aviation ($8.6 million); engineering and facilities ($6.7 million); medical ($0.4 million); life support ($6.7 million); field technology ($5.7 million); training ($0.8 million); UNMAS ($3.2 million); transport ($0.4 million); information and media ($3.2 million); supply chain ($1.0 million); and the possible conversion of Dhooble from a forward operating base to a tactical operating base ($6.4 million). 22. While the budget reductions may not immediately disrupt core operations, they will strain critical enabling capabilities essential for sustaining the effectiveness of AUSSOM. There is also a risk of a more significant impact as AUSSOM begins to implement the new concept of operations and the reductions start to manifest in the reduced ability of UNSOS to provide effective support. Within aviation support, the A/79/907 S/2025/268 25-06872 8/24 reductions will limit capacity for troop rotations, medical evacuations and resupply to remote bases. The reduction in the number of fixed-wing aircraft and standby capacity will increase reliance on rotary-wing assets and commercial flights, potentially creating scheduling constraints and reduced resilience. The elimination of the Q-400 aircraft will remove the capability to manage mass casualty evacuations and also impact the morale of the troops, as the aircraft is used for welfare flights between Mogadishu and Nairobi. In telecommunications, budget cuts may reduce the ability of AUSSOM to maintain robust networks for reconnaissance, intelligence- sharing and operational coordination, hampering situational awareness. 23. Reductions in funding may also compromise camp security infrastructure, potentially delaying upgrades or maintenance of surveillance systems, perimeter defences and security lighting. Threat analysis capabilities may suffer, limiting timely risk assessments and intelligence synthesis vital for countering the threats posed by improvised explosive devices. Community radio operations, crucial for countering extremist narratives and strengthening public outreach, will be handed over and run by local communities. Such a move may reduce broadcast reach and the ability of AUSSOM to follow, monitor and pre-empt Al-Shabaab propaganda. In addition, warehouse management may be impaired, causing delays in distributing critical supplies. Distribution delays may also endanger the decentralization drive of the mission, which is seen as an imperative to ensure operational effectiveness and enable the security transition. 24.",

In addition, warehouse management may be impaired, causing delays in distributing critical supplies. Distribution delays may also endanger the decentralization drive of the mission, which is seen as an imperative to ensure operational effectiveness and enable the security transition. 24. Reduced support to AUSSOM mission enabling units could lead to fleet servicing delays owing to limited technical expertise within the contingents. Such delays may increase vehicle downtime and impact mission mobility. The reductions in training will impact staff capacity enhancement, in particular for national staff. Moreover, reductions in facility management may potentially affect maintenance services that ensure hygiene standards and staff and troop welfare. Reduced availability of field defence stores and spare parts may compromise camp and base protection and response time to generator outages. Taken together, these reductions can potentially degrade the operational flexibility of AUSSOM and its response capacity and ability to secure the gains made in stabilizing Somalia over the years, even if immediate disruptions are avoided. In addition, support to the Somali security forces will also be affected by any disruptions to effective logistics support for AUSSOM, as these are an integral part of the joint or coordinated operations. 25. In line with the objective to rightsize UNSOS, the Support Office conducted an analysis of each of its pillars to determine possible post reductions, taking into account the new AUSSOM concept of operations and reduced support activities following the phased drawdown of ATMIS from 2022 to 2024. In conducting the analysis, the review team focused on identifying the number of staff required to ensure business continuity and operational effectiveness, noting that operational tempo is not expected to slow down in 2025/26. It is highly recommended that this initial analysis be followed by a thorough review of the staffing reductions needed to align resources with the operational adjustments outlined in the present review. This follow-up review should cover the advisory support that UNSOS will need to effectively implement an evidence-based rightsizing exercise. 26. Based on a preliminary analysis of potential reductions in staff positions that present a low or medium risk to operational effectiveness, the financial implications suggest a possible reduction of up to 20 per cent in civilian personnel costs, resulting in savings of approximately $18.4 million. That figures includes savings from posts and positions that will be abolished when UNTMIS closes in October 2026. Implementing a phased reduction approach would mitigate disruptions to operational support for AUSSOM. A/79/907 S/2025/268 9/24 25-06872 27. Accordingly, the estimated total reductions from efficiency gains, optimization and reduced support activities of UNSOS amount to $61.6 million (see enclosures 2 and 3), or 12.3 per cent of the 2024/25 budget ($43.2 million in operational costs and $18.4 million for posts and positions), with a view to enabling the hybrid implementation of resolution 2719 (2023) for AUSSOM. Impact of projected United Nations Support Office in Somalia savings on the hybrid implementation of resolution 2719 (2023) 28. As noted above (see para. 19), $132.1 million amounts to 75 per cent of the $176.2 million total requirement for AUSSOM. The $61.6 million savings from within the existing resources of UNSOS would leave AUSSOM short $70.5 million of the $132.1 million figure and $114.6 million short of its total requirements. Accordingly, should the Security Council decide to proceed under the hybrid implementation model, the General Assembly would have to appropriate an additional $70.5 million from the peacekeeping assessed budget, while international donors would have to contribute $44.1 million to meet the annual AUSSOM budget for troop reimbursements. 29. The review team believes that there are still opportunities to identify additional savings in future years in a phased manner. There are areas where AUSSOM could find more efficiencies, including in contingent-owned equipment (major equipment) and self-sustainment. The upcoming review of the statement of unit requirements, as part of the reconfiguration of AUSSOM, could be helpful in that regard. A comparative analysis may also be needed to determine whether it would be more economical for troop- and police-contributing countries to provide additional categories of self-sustainment7 or for UNSOS to continue providing such support.",

      "text": "tify additional savings in future years in a phased manner. There are areas where AUSSOM could find more efficiencies, including in contingent-owned equipment (major equipment) and self-sustainment. The upcoming review of the statement of unit requirements, as part of the reconfiguration of AUSSOM, could be helpful in that regard. A comparative analysis may also be needed to determine whether it would be more economical for troop- and police-contributing countries to provide additional categories of self-sustainment7 or for UNSOS to continue providing such support. In addition, there appears to be underutilization of military aviation assets in the mission, especially in the light of the lack of cross-sector air support, even when provided for in the concept of operations. A deeper analysis of actual usage of existing military aircraft may also present opportunities for cost reductions. Moreover, there are cost avoidance opportunities in the management of contingent-owned equipment beyond economic repair that should be destroyed in-country rather than repatriated at great cost. 30. As noted, AUSSOM and UNSOS can work together in various areas to find more efficiencies. The reconfiguration of AUSSOM could potentially yield savings if careful consideration is given to the most efficient and effective configuration of the mission\u2019s aviation fleet and the new layout of its bases. With such changes, it might be possible to find efficiencies in the resupply of life support to the bases, but it would take time to implement them. 31. Lastly, there are various areas in which UNSOS can strive to find more efficiency gains, by reviewing the manner in which it executes some aspects of its support package. Some potential areas to reassess are the mine action delivery model, which still relies predominantly on the United Nations Office for Project Services, and greater use of local procurement, in particular for delivery of supplies to the Somali security forces. __________________ 7 The Security Council, in its resolution 2010 (2011), decided, on an exceptional basis and owing to the unique character of the African Union Mission in Somalia, to extend logistical support to cover augmentation of some limited areas of self-sustainment, including catering equipment and training, communications equipment, sanitary and cleaning materials, furniture and stationery. A/79/907 S/2025/268 25-06872 10/24 Recommendations 32. The overall cost reduction of $61.6 million identified represents the balance between current UNSOS support for AUSSOM and the acceptable risk levels to its operations. Without additional budget assessments, this amount, as stated above (see para. 28), is insufficient to fully meet the $132.1 million needed from the assessed budget for troop reimbursements in the 2025/26 budget period at the mission specific rate of $1,000 proposed in the joint report. Moreover, the overall identified cost reduction will not be fully available on 1 July 2025 and will need to be phased over the course of the 2025/26 budget year. Furthermore, contributions from the African Union will be important to securing the $44.1 million that is to be mobilized as extra- budgetary resources. 33. On the operational support front, implementation of reduced support and costs would need to be phased, both to ensure mitigation measures are put in place and also to allow the necessary time to amend and terminate contracts. On the staffing front, while UNSOS can reduce positions that present a low or medium risk for its operational support to AUSSOM, a more thorough review should be done by UNSOS to ensure that an in-depth analysis is undertaken to guide reductions in staffing levels. In view of the light footprint of UNSOS, additional support in operational workforce planning can be sought from Headquarters in order to review and align staffing and structures with priorities and the concept of operations. Doing so is important because the staffing level and composition of UNSOS had been specifically configured to provide effective support to the successive African Union missions and the Support Office\u2019s concept of operations. Furthermore, the staffing reduction may have to be implemented in the light of the delayed reconfiguration of ATMIS to AUSSOM, as it entails several activity-intense components, including the reorientation and realignment of all troops (both African Union and Somalia security forces) to the new mission disposition, which itself entails the closing and handing over of forward and tactical operating bases. This reconfiguration will also include the repatriation of existing troops and equipment and the deployment of new troops and equipment.",

This reconfiguration will also include the repatriation of existing troops and equipment and the deployment of new troops and equipment. While these activities were initially forecasted to occur in phase 1 of the concept of operations, between January and June 2025, that is to say, within the 2024/25 budget period, consultations between the Federal Government of Somalia and the African Union, including the troop-contributing countries among its membership, were ongoing at the time of writing. A formal communication from the African Union on the composition of the troop-contributing countries in AUSSOM is still pending. Accordingly, adequate staffing capacities in UNSOS will be required to support the full realization of phase 1 of the AUSSOM strategic concept of operations, which can be expected to continue into the 2025/26 budget period. 34. The Security Council, in its resolution 2767 (2024), endorsed the recommendation in the joint report for one-off additional costs to enable the reconfiguration and realignment of AUSSOM during phase 1 of the concept of operations. UNSOS estimated that it would require between $43.2 million (scenario 1) and $50.5 million (scenario 2) as part of these one-off costs to facilitate phase 1 of the reconfiguration of AUSSOM, including the repatriation and emplacement of troops. Scenario 1 is based on the concept of operations, including the handover of 24 forward operating bases, the closure of 5 forward operating bases, the construction of 3 new locations (2 main operating bases and 1 tactical operating base) and the expansion of 16 main operating and tactical operating bases. Scenario 2, which is based on the force laydown proposed by the Federal Government of Somalia as presented to the African Union in February 2025, includes the handover of 9 forward operating bases, the closure of 2 forward operating bases, the construction of 3 new locations (2 main operating bases and 1 tactical operating base) and the expansion of 10 main operating and tactical operating bases. There is no agreement A/79/907 S/2025/268 11/24 25-06872 yet on the concept of operations, and implementation of phase 1 has not started. It is therefore anticipated that these one-off costs will be incurred within the 2025/26 budget year. A breakdown of one-off additional costs for phase 1 of the reconfiguration of AUSSOM is set out in enclosure 4. 35. Additional reduction of support and costs may be possible, but that would require a far more in-depth review of the entire UNSOS and AUSSOM operations, including the support provided to the Somali security forces, although this support is funded from voluntary contributions. The United Nations Secretariat and the African Union Commission should continue their collaboration to identify further efficiency gains across all three components (military and police, civilian personnel and operations) of the UNSOS budget. Given the proportion of the budget of UNSOS that is directly dedicated to AUSSOM operation, focusing exclusively on the Support Office will not yield sufficient savings. Accordingly, there is a need for a deeper analysis of what UNSOS and AUSSOM could do differently together to achieve greater efficiency and of what AUSSOM could do to enhance efficiency and effectiveness. 36. With enhanced efficiencies, optimization and cost reductions in both UNSOS and AUSSOM, serious consideration can be given to implementing resolution 2719 (2023) through a single budget model. Doing so would need to be complemented with robust and effective joint mobilization of the 25 per cent of the amount required for troop and police reimbursement that will not come from the assessed budget. Taking into account budget formulation timelines, the United Nations Secretariat and the African Union Commission could continue to work together to streamline their operations, maximize efficiencies and further reduce costs between now and December 2025, with a view to submitting a single budget under the framework established by resolution 2719 (2023) for the 2026/27 budget period. While efficiencies should be maximized, there should be flexibility to the current ceiling of $499.8 million for both missions, given that the current AUSSOM concept of operations is being supported by the light footprint of UNSOS. 37. The positive partnership of AUSSOM and UNSOS also extended to the Federal Government of Somalia.",

The positive partnership of AUSSOM and UNSOS also extended to the Federal Government of Somalia. All Government interlocutors appreciated the excellent tripartite relationship and commended UNSOS and its leadership for the collaborative engagements. While many of the discussions with Somali counterparts were centred on support and challenges related to voluntary contributions to the UNSOS- administered trust fund, the following considerations should be kept in mind. First, the support provided by UNSOS to the Somali security forces is based on the infrastructure established to support AUSSOM, and a significant change to that structure would affect the support available to the Somali security forces. Second, an increasing number of fatalities and casualties now occur among the Somali security forces. For example, in 2024, 87 per cent of the 723 casualty evacuation cases were for Somali soldiers. Accordingly, in order to ensure the transition process is not jeopardized, any assessment of support to AUSSOM must also take into account the critical requirements of Somalis, in particular because they assume greater security responsibilities. Third, UNSOS has developed a robust national capacity-building programme across several components, including aviation, and continued investments are essential to sustain the positive legacy of strengthening the sovereign capacity of Somalia. Conclusion 38. While questions of efficiency, efficacy and financing have been at the centre of the present review, it is worth recalling the importance of AUSSOM and UNSOS to the stability of Somalia, the region and beyond. There is a broad consensus that a A/79/907 S/2025/268 25-06872 12/24 capable and well-supported AUSSOM remains indispensable. The consolidation of hard-won gains in Somalia and the price already paid in financial resources and lives lost should be kept in mind as AUSSOM enters its final transition to Somali security forces. While there are understandable global financial constraints and multiple competing global priorities, the considerable progress made in and around Somalia has been worth the sustained attention and investment of the African Union and the United Nations and their member States. With the approach of the transition of security responsibilities to the Federal Government of Somalia, the international community needs to stay the course to the end. Given the vital role of AUSSOM in maintaining security in Somalia, it is critical that the international community establish a sustainable, predictable and adequate funding mechanism that has the full support of the Security Council. 39. UNSOS is an effective, high-value and efficient support office. Its budget has been reduced from a peak of $582 million in the 2017/18 budget period, when AMISOM comprised 22,126 personnel, to $499.8 million in the 2024/25 budget period for the support of 12,626 ATMIS personnel. As a light footprint office supporting a mission engaged in difficult peace enforcement operations, the staffing level of UNSOS does not lend itself to mathematical ratios of civilian staff to military personnel. The present review represents an effort to provide the Security Council and General Assembly with an in-depth, impartial and nuanced view of what cost reductions and efficiencies might be possible from within 2024/25 budget of UNSOS. A careful, phased and risk-based approach can support the strategic aim of the international community in Somalia, while also laying a solid foundation for the implementation of resolution 2719 (2023) for African Union-led peace support operations authorized by the Security Council.

In addition, the C-130 does not have permission to operate inside Somalia. By 1 July 2025 No applicable mitigation measures, and the residual risk is estimated to be low. 1 fixed-wing Citation II jet, standby air medical evacuation (located in Nairobi) 300 Medium: limited fixed-wing aircraft passenger and cargo movement. By 1 July 2025 The Mission will repurpose the DHC-8- 300 located in Mogadishu as the air medical evacuation standby aircraft. That standby aircraft will have a greater capacity to carry patients and life support supplies. In addition, by positioning the standby aircraft in Mogadishu, the reaction time will decrease significantly, from 2 hours to 30 minutes. The residual risk is estimated to be low. 1 fixed-wing DHC-8 Q400 (located in Nairobi) 4 500 Medium: no fixed-wing aircraft for mass casualty evacuation or for troop-contributing country or individual police officer rotations, or for staff welfare travel to and from Nairobi or Mogadishu. By 1 July 2025 African Union Support and Stabilization Mission in Somalia and United Nations staff will depend on commercial flights for travel. The residual risk is estimated to be medium. 8 600 Engineering and facilities Reduction of facility and grounds maintenance, cleaning, pest and vector control and plant and equipment maintenance 2 800 Medium: potential staff welfare, medical and hygiene-related issues. By 1 July 2025 Troops in sector headquarters will perform cleaning and ground maintenance services in their areas. The residual risk is estimated to be medium to low. Reduction in miscellaneous acquisitions of field defence supplies, Hesco protections, spare parts, chemicals and related containers and freight 2 700 Medium: reduced quantity of field defence supplies and generator requirements to be issued, risk of inability to absorb additional or unforeseen requirements. By 1 July 2025 The residual risk is estimated to be low. Bulk water supply service 600 Medium to high: risk is dependent on ability to drill boreholes.

By 1 July 2025 Flights or commercial travel tickets and subsistence allowances will be provided to patients to be treated in Nairobi. The residual risk is estimated to be low. 400 Life support Reduction in the individual cost of rations 4 000 Low: the budget for rations is based on the cost individual day rate from the ration contract, which represents the daily cost to feed each troop member. Currently, the rate is set at $6.04, but troops are ordering food with a lower rate. As a result, the average rate can be decreased to $5.10, potentially leading to savings on overall ration costs. By 1 July 2025 The residual risk is estimated to be low. Reduction of aviation fuel consumption related to fleet reconfiguration 2 000 Low: fuel reduction corresponding to the reduction of three fixed-wings, as described under \u201cAir operations\u201d above. By 1 July 2025 In the event of a sudden increase in the air fleet, the primary mitigation measure will be to utilize the local fuel reserves to ensure continuity of operations. The residual risk is estimated to be low. Reduction of the strategic fuel reserve 700 Medium: the fuel requirements have been calculated on the basis of current trends in historical consumption: (a) diesel reserves have decreased from 3 million litres to 2.4 million litres; and (b) Jet A-1 reserves have been reduced from 1 million litres to 0.8 million litres. In addition, the local reserve in Mogadishu for the Jet A-1 has been reduced from 300,000 litres to 260,000 litres. By 1 July 2025 The Mission will closely monitor consumption patterns and assess whether the strategic reserve levels need to be revised accordingly to ensure adequate supply.

By 1 July 2025 On-site and online sessions. The residual risk is estimated to be medium. Reduction of training sessions for staff 500 Low: impact on the capacity building of staff members, especially national staff. By 1 July 2025 On-site and online sessions. The residual risk is estimated to be medium. 800 Mine action Contractors 1 300 Low: change in management of services and potential longer response times; limited ability to deal with multiple tasks simultaneously and to manage unplanned or emergency situations. By 1 July 2025 Efforts will be made to streamline the contract process. The residual risk is estimated to be low. A/79/907 S/2025/268 25-06872 17/24 Category Proposed reduction Amount Impact of the reduction Estimated demobilization Mitigation measures Streamlining improvised explosive device disposal training and mentoring contract 1 400 Medium: fewer explosive ordnance disposal and improvised explosive device disposal trainers and mentors available to support troop-contributing countries. By 1 July 2025 Troop-contributing countries to maximize the deployment of troops that have previously been trained by the Mine Action Service and have operational experience in Somalia. Live mentoring will be replaced by after- action review. There will be a reliance on troop- contributing countries to fill the capacity gap. The residual risk is estimated to be medium. Streamlining mission enabling unit support. Reduction in support to mission enabling unit. Withdrawal of combat engineering support and training and licensing of heavy machinery operators and mechanics 500 Medium: reduction in non-counter-improvised explosive device support through mission enabling unit. Troops will not receive in-country training in the use of mission enabling unit-provided equipment, and no combat engineering technical advice will be provided. By 1 July 2025 Troop-contributing countries are to ensure that appropriate capacity in non-counter-improvised explosive device support (e.g. plant operators and operations officers) are deployed. The residual risk is estimated to be medium. 3 200 Transport Reduction in maintenance labour for mission enabling unit provided by third-party contractors 400 Medium: potential delays in maintenance and potential lack of technical expertise of the fleet composition within the troop contingents. By 1 July 2025 AUSSOM will provide labour for the maintenance and UNSOS will provide spare parts. The residual risk is estimated to be medium, due to the potential lack of technical capabilities and frequent rotations of troops and technicians of AUSSOM and their capacity to adhere to minimum maintenance requirements, which may result in accelerated degradation of the mission enabling unit fleet. 400 Public communication Discontinuation of UNSOS support to community radio stations 2 200 Low: the Mission is implementing a potential exit strategy earlier than planned. By 1 July 2025 Handing over radio equipment to the communities to maintain good relationships. The residual risk is estimated to be low. Termination of radio monitoring and interpretation services 100 Low: there will be no need for monitoring once radios are handed over. By 1 July 2025 Interpretation services will be provided by national staff from AUSSOM and UNSOS. The residual risk is estimated to be low.

The residual risk is estimated to be medium. 3 200 Supply chain Reduction in physical verification services 200 Low/medium: potential delays in reporting or discrepancies in asset verification. The cost of physical verification services will be reduced by decreasing the frequency of verification in regional locations while optimizing overall coverage to maintain efficiency (currently is performed by third-party contractor). By 1 July 2025 UNSOS is enhancing planning and logistics to maintain required coverage efficiently. The residual risk is estimated to be low. Reduction in Central Warehouse Section 600 Low: delay in issuance of materials. Reduction in cost by lowering labour and resource requirements by streamlining frequency of distribution and optimizing processes such as packing and issuance of items. By 1 July 2025 UNSOS is optimizing logistics, prioritizing shipments and proactively managing procurement to minimize any disruptions. The residual risk is estimated to be low. Reduction in Central Warehouse Section disposal services 100 Low: potential delay in disposal of armoured vehicles. The number of assets ready for disposal that require physical dismantling will be reduced, thereby lowering associated costs. By 1 July 2025 UNSOS will conduct reviews to ensure that disposal generates income rather than incurs additional costs. The residual risk is estimated to be low. Reduction in Central Warehouse Section material- handling equipment rentals 200 Medium: inability to move containers and therefore no access to stocks. Equipment rental from contractors will be discontinued and there will be a focus on collaborating with the Transport Section and warehouse service contractor to meet warehouse requirements for material-handling equipment. By 1 July 2025 Material-handling equipment will be integrated into the warehouse services contract, and the Mission\u2019s material- handling equipment will be maintained and repaired on schedule to prevent operational disruptions.

By 1 July 2025 Mitigation measures: UNSOS will assign aeromedical or utility helicopters to evacuate emergency casualties or provide logistical and administrative support to main operating bases and tactical operating bases within the operational area of the Kenya Defence Forces. The nearest available helicopters include one utility Mi-8 stationed in Kismaayo under a commercial long-term charter agreement and two aeromedical evacuation-configured helicopters based in Mogadishu under a similar agreement. The residual risk is considered high due to the reliance on alternative helicopters from Kismaayo or Mogadishu for emergency casualty evacuations in the northern part of the Dhooble operational area. This assessment is based on the Mission\u2019s inability to guarantee the transportation of casualties from a potential incident or accident site \u2013 primarily in the northern part of the area of responsibility \u2013 to the nearest level 2 medical unit within the critical two-hour timeframe. Such a delay could lead to loss of life and damage to the Organization\u2019s reputation. 3 200 Engineering Minimum and remote routine facilities management services 200 High: reduced maintenance services.

The residual risk is estimated to be medium. No routine pest control services 300 High: potential creation of an environment for insects and pests to thrive if troops do not cut grass and trim plants regularly. During the rainy season, stagnant water collects in overgrown areas, providing perfect breeding grounds for mosquitoes. If pest control measures are not in place, the risk of malaria outbreaks increases significantly. By 1 July 2025 AUSSOM to take over responsibility for grounds maintenance.

The plan stated that the Special Committee, with the cooperation of the administering Powers, should: (a) Prepare periodic analyses of the progress and extent of the implementation of the Declaration; (b) Review the impact of the economic and social situation on the constitutional and political advancement of Non-Self-Governing Territories; (c) Organize during the Decade seminars in the Caribbean and Pacific regions alternately, as well as at United Nations Headquarters, to review the progress achieved in the implementation of the plan of action, with the participation of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, their elected representatives, the administering Powers, Member States, regional organizations, specialized agencies, non-governmental organizations and experts. 8. In addition, the Special Committee was to continue to seek, as a matter of priority, the full cooperation of the administering Powers with regard to the dispatch of United Nations visiting missions to Non-Self-Governing Territories and, with the cooperation of the administering Powers, make every effort to facilitate and encourage the participation of representatives of Non-Self-Governing Territories in regional and international organizations, as well as in the specialized agencies of the United Nations system, the Special Committee itself and other United Nations decolonization bodies. 9. At its fifty-fifth session, the General Assembly adopted resolution 55/146 of 8 December 2000, in which it declared the period 2001\u20132010 the Second International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism, and called upon Member States to redouble their efforts to implement the plan of action, as contained in the annex to the report of the Secretary-General dated 13 December 1991 (A/46/634/Rev.1), updated where necessary, to serve as the plan of action for the Second International Decade.",

Maintenance of international peace and security 1. The Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization considered the question of the maintenance of international peace and security during the general exchange of views held at its 312th and 313th meetings, on 18 February 2025, and at the 1st meeting of the Working Group of the Whole, on 19 February. 2. In their general comments, several delegations noted the eightieth anniversary of the establishment of the United Nations and emphasized the paramount importance of the Charter of the United Nations for the maintenance of international peace and security. Several delegations called upon all Member States to strengthen their commitment to the Charter, including through upholding its purposes and principles, such as refraining from the threat or use of force, respecting territorial integrity and the peaceful settlement of disputes, faithfully practising multilateralism and upholding the international system with the United Nations at its core and on the basis of international law. Concern was expressed over the selective or accommodative interpretation of the provisions of the Charter and attempts to replace the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter with a new set of rules that had never been discussed in an inclusive and transparent manner. 3. Many delegations expressed serious concern about violations of the Charter and breaches of international law in ongoing conflicts in various regions of the world and reaffirmed the necessity of protecting the purposes and principles of the Charter and upholding international law. They reiterated their call for the redoubling of efforts towards the achievement of a just and lasting peace in accordance with the Charter. 4. A number of delegations expressed regret that the Special Committee had been unable to adopt a substantive report at its most recent three sessions owing to divergent views and a lack of consensus on difficult issues and expressed concern that the lack of a substantive report rendered it impossible to have an effective institutional A/AC.182/2025/L.2 25-02990 2/4 record of what had taken place during the sessions. Those delegations urged a return to consensus so that the Committee could adopt its report. 5. A number of delegations reiterated that the reform of the Organization should be carried out in accordance with the principles and procedures established in the Charter while focusing on preserving the legal framework of this constitutional instrument. It was underlined that the General Assembly remained the chief deliberative, policymaking and representative organ of the United Nations. A number of delegations reiterated their concern at the continuing encroachment by the Security Council on the functions and powers of the Assembly and the Economic and Social Council by addressing issues that fell within the competences of those organs, and at the attempts to enter areas of setting norms and establishing definitions that fell within the purview of the Assembly. The view was expressed that there was a need to achieve the right balance envisaged in the Charter between the functions and powers of the principal organs of the Organization, which were encouraged to intensify cooperation and dialogue with one another. It was also emphasized that the Special Committee was the appropriate forum for examining the legal aspects of those issues. A. Introduction and implementation of sanctions imposed by the United Nations 6. During the general exchange of views held at the 312th and 313th meetings of the Special Committee, on 18 February, and the 1st meeting of the Working Group of the Whole, on 19 February, reference was made to the issue of the introduction and implementation of sanctions imposed by the United Nations (see General Assembly resolution 64/115, annex). 7. During the general exchange of views and the 1st meeting of the Working Group of the Whole, a number of delegations noted that the Special Committee provided a channel of communication between Member States and the Secretariat regarding all aspects of the introduction and implementation of sanctions imposed by the United Nations. It was emphasized that sanctions should avoid double standards and selectivity.",

It was emphasized that sanctions should avoid double standards and selectivity. Others expressed the view that sanctions were blunt instruments, the use of which raised fundamental ethical questions as to their legitimacy, given that they could inflict suffering on vulnerable groups in the target country. 8. Delegations emphasized that sanctions should be implemented in full compliance with the provisions of the Charter and international law, including international humanitarian law and international human rights law, by ensuring that sanctions were fit for purpose, with clear and objective listing criteria. Some delegations welcomed the adoption of Security Council resolution 2664 (2022) on a humanitarian exception to asset freeze measures across United Nations sanctions regimes. 9. The adoption of Council resolution 2744 (2024), which introduced new procedures for delisting petitions submitted to the Focal Point Mechanism, and Council resolution 2734 (2024), which extended the mandate of the Office of the Ombudsperson to the Security Council Committee pursuant to resolutions 1267 (1999), 1989 (2011) and 2253 (2015) concerning Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Da\u2019esh), Al-Qaida and associated individuals, groups, undertakings and entities was also welcomed. The Secretary-General was congratulated for his continued efforts to assist States affected by sanctions imposed by the Council. 10. It was reiterated that sanctions should be imposed only as a measure of last resort when there existed a threat to international peace and security, a breach of peace or an act of aggression, and that they should be imposed in accordance with the Charter and on the basis of evidence. Some delegations considered that sanctions were not applicable as a preventive measure and should be predicated upon the exhaustion A/AC.182/2025/L.2 3/4 25-02990 of all other peaceful means. It was emphasized that the objectives of sanctions regimes should be clearly defined, so as to minimize the impact on the civilian population, and based on tenable legal grounds and imposed with a clear time frame, subject to monitoring and a periodic review, and lifted as soon as their objectives were achieved. It was noted that listed individuals and entities must have the right to challenge their inclusion through an effective review mechanism. It was also noted that the objectives of sanctions were not and should not be to punish or exact retribution on an entire population. Several delegations noted that sanctions should not produce unintended consequences in the target State or in third States that might lead to violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, nor should they hinder humanitarian assistance from reaching the civilian population. It was further noted that there was a need to keep due process under constant monitoring. 11. Several delegations reaffirmed that sanctions were an important tool for ensuring the maintenance of international peace and security without recourse to the use of force. The view was expressed that, in order to be effective, sanctions must be properly implemented by all States Members of the United Nations. Further discussions on strengthening the implementation of sanctions were encouraged, including the termination of sanctions where an individual or entity would no longer need to be subjected to such sanctions, and the readjustment of sanctions where fundamental rights of an entire population were disproportionately affected. The view was also expressed that sanctions outside United Nations auspices did not fall within the scope of the Special Committee. It was noted that there was no conflict between sanctions imposed under the United Nations framework and autonomous sanctions and that the latter were considered legal and legitimate tools to achieve foreign policy, security and other objectives. 12. A number of delegations reiterated their concerns about the imposition of unilateral sanctions by States in violation of international law, including the Charter, principles such as sovereign equality and non-intervention in the internal affairs of States, the rules of the World Trade Organization and the international rule of law. It was noted that unilateral coercive measures, in particular economic sanctions and financial restrictions, could disproportionately harm civilian populations, exacerbate humanitarian crises and undermine fundamental r",

It was noted that unilateral coercive measures, in particular economic sanctions and financial restrictions, could disproportionately harm civilian populations, exacerbate humanitarian crises and undermine fundamental rights, including the rights to development, health and life. The view was also expressed that unilateral coercive measures were punitive in nature and that sanctions should instead be imposed only in a multilateral context. Some delegations called for the practice of unilateral sanctions to cease immediately and emphasized that there was an urgent need to make progress on the subject. 13. Delegations expressed appreciation for the regular briefings by the Secretariat on the document entitled \u201cIntroduction and implementation of sanctions imposed by the United Nations\u201d, contained in the annex to General Assembly resolution 64/115. It was once again suggested that the Secretariat should develop its capacity to properly assess the unintended side effects of sanctions imposed by the Security Council, as such capacity had not been sufficiently developed in the past, in order to fully assess the short-term and long-term socioeconomic and humanitarian consequences of the Organization\u2019s sanctions regimes. Briefing 14. At its 1st meeting, the Working Group of the Whole was briefed by a representative of the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs on the document contained in the annex to General Assembly resolution 64/115, as requested by the Assembly in paragraph 4 of its resolution 79/125. The representative provided information on the elements of the document and general information about United Nations sanctions regimes, adjustments made to United Nations sanctions since the A/AC.182/2025/L.2 25-02990 4/4 previous briefing, developments in the implementation of sanctions following the adoption of Security Council resolution 2664 (2022), the adoption of resolution 2744 (2024), the role of the sanctions committees and expert panels in the implementation of sanctions, issues of due process, and the monitoring and review mechanisms. The briefing also referred to the Secretariat efforts to continue increasing the geographical diversity and gender balance among sanctions expert panels. She also responded to questions from delegations on several aspects of sanctions regimes. 15. Appreciation was expressed for the briefing and the efforts made to enhance the transparency of the procedures relating to sanctions and due process. 16. It was noted that strengthening due process was essential for the United Nations sanctions regimes, and reference was made to the adoption of Security Council resolutions 2744 (2024) and 2734 (2024). The Secretariat was asked what the key points were with regard to implementing resolution 2744 (2024) and ensuring the effectiveness of the Focal Point Mechanism. The Secretariat was also asked how the independence of the Ombudsperson could be further enhanced in the context of strengthening due process rights. The representative of the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs stressed the importance of due process in the implementation of the measures and noted that the procedures pursuant to resolution 2744 (2024) would become effective once the focal point was appointed. It was noted that the structure of the Office of the Focal Point for Delisting would be similar to that of the Office of the Ombudsperson. She emphasized the importance of raising awareness of the existence and functioning of delisting procedures. In relation to the possible improvement of the work of the Ombudsperson, she recalled that the Office of the Ombudsperson was dependent on the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs for administrative support but had a separate budget and enjoyed substantive independence. 17. The view was expressed that United Nations sanctions were to be implemented in full compliance with international humanitarian law, and the adoption of Security Council resolution 2761 (2024) was noted with appreciation. The Secretariat was asked about the impact of the humanitarian carveout to United Nations sanctions regimes, implementation challenges, and potential solutions.

In relation to challenges to implementation, a possible risk of overcompliance by financial institutions and other actors was noted, but the representative explained that the Emergency Relief Coordinator had observed that there had been a reduction in some delays that humanitarian actors faced to deliver or carry out their activities. 18. In the context of the termination of the mandate of the Panel of Experts for the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1718 (2006), the Secretariat was asked about the implementation challenges in connection with regimes with and without panels of experts and whether any specific challenges had emerged regarding the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea sanctions regime since the Panel\u2019s termination. The representative of the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs explained that sanctions committees were mandated by the Council to monitor the implementation of sanctions, and she noted that, where there was no panel of experts, the regimes lacked an independent monitoring mechanism. It was also noted that panels were often contacted for clarification regarding the implementation of sanction regimes.",

Consideration of the revised working paper submitted by Cuba on the strengthening of the role of the Organization and enhancing its effectiveness: adoption of recommendations 1. The revised working paper submitted by Cuba at the 2019 session of the Special Committee (A/74/33, annex I) was referred to during the general exchange of views held at the 312th and 313th meetings of the Special Committee, on 18 February, and was considered at the 1st meeting of the Working Group of the Whole, on 19 February. 2. At the 1st meeting of the Working Group of the Whole, the sponsor delegation explained that the revised paper envisaged a legal study of the powers of the General Assembly under the Charter, with a view to facilitating the active and effective exercise of those powers. The sponsor delegation reiterated its invitation to delegations to share their views so as to reach a consensus on the paper. 3. Some delegations expressed their support for the proposal contained in the revised working paper. It was considered that the paper would contribute to strengthening the role of the Organization and was not duplicative of the efforts for the revitalization of the work of the General Assembly, so should remain on the agenda of the Special Committee. 4. Other delegations were of the opinion that the functions of the principal organs of the United Nations were adequately defined in the Charter and that there would be no added value in considering the proposal because it was duplicative of revitalization efforts within other forums of the Organization.",

Maintenance of international peace and security C. Consideration of the revised working paper submitted by Belarus and the Russian Federation 1. During the general exchange of views held at the 312th and 313th meetings of the Special Committee, on 18 February, and at the 1st meeting of the Working Group of the Whole, on 19 February, the Special Committee considered the further revised working paper submitted by Belarus and the Russian Federation at the 2014 session of the Special Committee (A/69/33, para. 37), in which it was recommended, inter alia, that an advisory opinion be requested from the International Court of Justice as to the legal consequences of the resort to the use of force by States without prior authorization by the Security Council, except in the exercise of the right to self- defence. 2. The sponsor delegations recalled the continued relevance of the topic addressed in the further revised working paper, highlighting that the topic was key in the international agenda. A sponsor delegation emphasized that an advisory opinion by the International Court of Justice would make a significant contribution to safeguarding and to the progressive development of the principles and rules of international law, as well as to strengthening international peace and security. A sponsor delegation reiterated that the legal question proposed in the further revised working paper was of a generic character and was not intended to seek the Court\u2019s position on any specific situation. The sponsor delegations expressed their readiness to consider constructive proposals with respect to the further revised working paper. 3. A number of delegations reiterated their support for the proposal and the thorough and meaningful consideration of it by the Special Committee. Other delegations expressed their opposition to the request for an advisory opinion by the International Court of Justice as outlined in the proposal. It was indicated that the proposal did not pose a well-defined and specific question for the International Court A/AC.182/2025/L.4 25-02825 2/2 of Justice to provide a meaningful response. The view was also expressed that the proposal was not necessary, and it was suggested that the Special Committee could move on from the proposal.",

Repertory of Practice of United Nations Organs and Repertoire of the Practice of the Security Council 1. Reference was made to the Repertory of Practice of United Nations Organs and the Repertoire of the Practice of the Security Council during the general exchange of views held at the 312th and 313th meetings of the Special Committee, on 18 February, and at the 2nd meeting of the Working Group of the Whole, on 20 February. 2. During the general exchange of views and in the Working Group of the Whole, the significance of the two publications in providing analytical studies of the application and interpretation of the Charter and preserving the institutional memory of the Organization was recalled. Delegations commended the Secretariat on its continuing efforts to update the Repertory and the Repertoire and to eliminate the backlog in the preparation of the Repertory and expressed gratitude to those Member States that had made voluntary contributions to the trust funds for the preparation of the two publications. Several delegations noted with concern that the backlog in the preparation of the Repertory, in particular volume III, had not been eliminated and called upon the Secretary-General to address the issue effectively and as a priority. The Secretariat was commended for expanding the use of technology to make the Repertory and the Repertoire available electronically and accessible on their respective websites. The need to publish the two publications in all official languages of the United Nations was noted. 3. At the 2nd meeting of the Working Group, the representatives of the Secretariat gave a briefing on the status of the preparation of the Repertoire and the Repertory. 4. With regard to the status of the Repertoire, further to the most recent report of the Secretary-General on the Repertory of Practice of United Nations Organs and Repertoire of the Practice of the Security Council (A/79/188), it was reported that significant progress continued to be made in the preparation of the publication, with a focus on the completion of the twenty-sixth supplement and the commencement of the preparation of the twenty-seventh supplement, covering the years 2023 and 2024, A/AC.182/2025/L.8 25-02892 2/4 respectively. More specifically, it was noted that the advance version of the twenty- sixth supplement had been completed and posted online in December 2024. It was also reported that the preparation of the twenty-seventh supplement was well under way and that advance versions of sections of that edition were planned to be uploaded during the second quarter of the year, with a view to having the full publication available online by October 2025. It was also noted that the preparatory work on the twenty-eighth supplement, covering the year 2025, had commenced. In addition, it was reported that the editing and translation of prior editions of the Repertoire had maintained their scheduled course. The final version of the twenty-fifth supplement (covering 2022) had been published in October 2024, and the twenty-sixth supplement (covering 2023) was scheduled for publication in English in October 2025. It was noted that Repertoire editions covering the period from 1989 to 2021 were available online in all six official languages, and translation of the twenty-fifth supplement was expected to be completed by May 2025. 5. With regard to innovation and the use of technology, it was reported that the Security Council Practices and Charter Research Branch of the Security Council Affairs Division continued to prioritize the use of innovative technology as a means of highlighting various aspects of the practice of the Council and enhancing the effectiveness of the collection and analysis of relevant data. The Branch currently maintained over 20 online dashboards and data sets on the practice of the Security Council, including a new online dashboard covering the Council\u2019s practice on climate and peace and security, launched in June 2024. In January 2025, the 2024 edition of the annual Highlights of Security Council Practice was released. Furthermore, the monthly newsletter entitled \u201cUN Security Council in Review\u201d continued to be issued. 6. It was further reported that, in July 2024, the Security Council Affairs Division had launched a new and modernized Security Council website, which had made the Repertoire and the research tools on the work of the Council more visible, accessible and user-friendly. 7.",

It was further reported that, in July 2024, the Security Council Affairs Division had launched a new and modernized Security Council website, which had made the Repertoire and the research tools on the work of the Council more visible, accessible and user-friendly. 7. Gratitude was expressed for the enhanced support of Member States through their voluntary contributions to the trust fund for updating the Repertoire of the Practice of the Security Council. It was noted that the resources under the trust fund had enabled the Branch to hire temporary staff to assist in the research, drafting and data analysis work. In October 2024, the Branch launched a new interactive dashboard on the status of the trust fund, providing an overview of Member States\u2019 contributions since its establishment in 1999 and of their support for the Branch through the Junior Professional Officer (associate expert) programme. The generous contributions made by Member States were noted. At the same time, it was noted that the levels and overall predictability of funding remained a concern. 8. It was further recalled that the 2025 appeal for contributions to the trust fund had been launched, with the following three main objectives: maintaining the annual publication schedule of the Repertoire; meeting the increasing demand of Member States for real-time data on the Council by creating new data sets and enhancing some existing data sets; and improving data collection methodology in support of the first two objectives. 9. Concerning the status of the Repertory, a briefing was given on the main developments since the issuance of the most recent report on the Repertory and Repertoire. 10. With regard to new studies in preparation, it was reported that, with regard to the call made upon the Secretary-General to address, effectively and on a priority basis, the backlog in the preparation of volume III of the Repertory (General Assembly resolution 79/125, para. 16), four studies pertaining to that volume were in preparation by the Faculty of Law at the University of Ottawa, on Articles 31 and 37 A/AC.182/2025/L.8 3/4 25-02892 of the Charter (for Supplement No. 11 (2010\u20132015)) and on Article 47 (for Supplement No. 11 and Supplement No. 12 (2016\u20132020)). It was noted that the Faculty was also in the process of preparing three studies for volume II, on articles 19, 20 and 22 (for Supplement No. 12), and two studies for volume IV, on Article 57 (for Supplements Nos. 11 and 12). That brought the total number of studies in preparation to nine. 11. It was also noted that Volume II of Supplement 10 (2000\u20132009) had been published on the Repertory website in English, French and Spanish and that one study on Article 13 (1) (a) (second part of the sentence) for Volume II of Supplement No. 11 had been completed. It was also reported that one study on Article 13 (1) (a) (second part of the sentence) for volume II of Supplement No. 12 had been reviewed by the author department (various divisions within the Office of Legal Affairs) and was in the process of being finalized. Furthermore, one study on Articles 104 and 105 for volume VI of Supplement No. 11 remained under review by its author department, the Office of Legal Affairs. 12. With regard to the participation of academic institutions in the research and drafting of studies for the Repertory, gratitude was expressed to the Faculty of Law at the University of Ottawa for its continued support. 13. Delegations were once again invited to increase the interest of academic institutions in their countries or regions in participating in the preparation of studies for the Repertory, while taking into account the importance of geographical diversity in that respect. 14. The attention of delegations was also drawn to the call for contributions to the trust fund to eliminate the backlog in the preparation of the Repertory. In that regard, it was noted that, as at 31 January 2025, the available balance of the fund was $93,030. 15. Following the reports by the representatives of the Secretariat, several delegations noted the efforts made to update the Repertory and the Repertoire, while reiterating their calls upon the Secretary-General to address the backlog in the preparation of the Repertory effectively and as a priority. 16.",

Peaceful settlement of disputes B. Proposal by the Russian Federation to recommend that the Secretariat be requested to establish a website on the peaceful settlement of disputes and update the Handbook on the Peaceful Settlement of Disputes between States 1. During the general exchange of views held at the 312th and 313th meetings of the Special Committee, on 18 February, and at the 2nd meeting of the Working Group of the Whole, on 20 February, the proposal by the Russian Federation to recommend that the Secretariat be requested to establish a website on the peaceful settlement of disputes and update the Handbook on the Peaceful Settlement of Disputes between States, as revised in 2014 (A/69/33, para. 52), was considered. The sponsor delegation reiterated the importance of its proposal, highlighting that the Handbook was a valuable source. It recalled that the Handbook had been prepared at the initiative of the Special Committee in 1992 and had not since been updated. The sponsor delegation emphasized the need to reflect the developments in the field of the peaceful settlement of disputes, in particular in the light of the statements made in the context of the annual thematic debate on the means for the settlement of disputes in the Special Committee, as well as to create a dedicated website. The sponsor delegation welcomed the support expressed by some delegations for the revised proposal, while questioning statements made by other delegations regarding the potential strain on the budget of the Organization should the proposal be implemented. The sponsor delegation requested information from the Secretariat on the availability of resources to implement the proposal or parts thereof. It noted the absence of objections by delegations to asking the Secretariat to provide estimates, for the next session of the Special Committee, of the costs involved in implementing the proposal. 2. During the general exchange of views and in the Working Group of the Whole, several delegations voiced support for the proposal, reiterating that the Handbook was A/AC.182/2025/L.7 25-02889 2/2 a valuable document. It was stated that the Special Committee was instrumental in the preparation of the Handbook and that updating it would be useful, in particular taking into account the best practices shared by Member States in the Special Committee during the annual thematic debate on the means for the settlement of disputes. It was also stated that establishing a dedicated website and updating the Handbook would have a crucial impact on the popularization of international law and a positive impact on efforts to strengthen the work of the Organization. 3. Other delegations continued to question the added value of the proposal, given the availability of online resources on the peaceful settlement of disputes, reiterating their concern that it would not be a proper prioritization of the existing limited resources allocated to the Secretariat. Some delegations indicated their openness to considering additional information from the Secretariat on how the Handbook could be updated within existing resources. 4. The Secretary of the Special Committee clarified that any information on the possibility of implementing the proposal within existing resources would depend on the precise scope of the proposal.",

Maintenance of international peace and security B. Consideration of the revised proposal submitted by Libya with a view to strengthening the role of the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace and security 1. The revised proposal submitted by Libya with a view to strengthening the role of the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace and security (A/53/33, para. 98) was referred to during the general exchange of views held at the 312th and 313th meetings of the Special Committee, on 18 February, and at the 1st meeting of the Working Group of the Whole, on 19 February. 2. The sponsor delegation recalled the background to the proposal and highlighted that it had been considered by the Special Committee since 1998. It also recalled that the proposal was aimed at, inter alia, reforming the work of the United Nations and reorganizing its organs based on the principles of justice, democracy and the sovereign equality of States. The sponsor delegation stated that the proposal was based on the following key ideas: considering ways and means by which the role of the General Assembly in the maintenance of international peace and security could be strengthened, in line with Articles 10, 11 and 14 of the Charter of the United Nations, given the common responsibility of all Member States in the maintenance of international peace and security; considering ways to enhance the relationship between the General Assembly and the Security Council, in line with Articles 15 and 24 of the Charter, ensuring that membership of the latter reflects equitable geographical distribution; and considering ways in which Chapter VII of the Charter had been evoked. The sponsor delegation further recalled comments from other delegations suggesting that the proposal duplicated ongoing revitalization efforts in other forums. In that regard, the sponsor delegation stated that there were elements of the proposal that remained valid and were not subject to contradictions or duplication, which needed to be highlighted.

Several delegations reiterated their support for the continued consideration of the proposal and emphasized that the proposal merited further meaningful, results- based deliberations and discussions. It was stated that the proposal, if implemented, would have a positive impact on strengthening the work of the Organization. 4. Other delegations reiterated their view that the proposal was unnecessary, as it was among those that were duplicative or inconsistent with ongoing revitalization efforts undertaken elsewhere within the Organization. Some delegations stated that the relationship between the different organs within the Organization was adequately and well defined in the Charter, and that clarification by the Special Committee was thus not needed. It was also stated that the proposal had not developed into an actionable proposal, nor had it been aimed at filling gaps in existing revitalization processes. The sponsor delegation was encouraged to withdraw the proposal, as it had been on the agenda of the Special Committee for years without generating consensus.",

Working methods of the Special Committee and identification of new subjects A. Working methods of the Special Committee 1. The issue of the working methods of the Special Committee was considered during the general exchange of views at the 312th and 313th meetings of the Special Committee, held on 18 February, and at the 3rd meeting of the Working Group of the Whole, held on 21 February. 2. During the general exchange of views, delegations stressed the importance of the Special Committee in strengthening the role of the Organization in furtherance of the principles and objectives of the Charter, strengthening international cooperation and fostering dialogue and advancing the development of international law, as well as the role of the Special Committee in the clarification and interpretation of provisions of the Charter. A number of delegations emphasized that the Special Committee could contribute to the reform process of the Organization, in particular in the examination of legal aspects thereof, and to its revitalization. 3. The Special Committee was encouraged to improve its efficiency and productivity, including by considering shortening its sessions or transitioning to biennial meetings to make better use of limited Secretariat resources. It was reiterated that the Special Committee should focus its attention on proposals that were practical, non-political and not duplicative of efforts elsewhere in the United Nations and that it should not be used as a forum for raising bilateral concerns. Some delegations emphasized the need to streamline the working methods of the Special Committee, to remove outdated or duplicative proposals and to move beyond repetitive debates towards concrete and time-bound proposals. 4. It was stated that the working methods of the Special Committee should be practical and effective, ensuring that all proposals were fairly and equitably examined A/AC.182/2025/L.9 25-02993 2/5 and focusing on results that could strengthen the role of the United Nations. It was stressed that the Special Committee must find a balance between the competencies of the main organs of the United Nations, while adhering to the provisions of the Charter and promoting enhanced cooperation and coordination among the various bodies in order to avoid any duplicative efforts. Several delegations opposed the biennialization of the Special Committee, highlighting the importance of annual thematic debates. 5. It was reiterated that the full implementation of the mandate of the Special Committee depended on the political will of States and on the full and effective implementation of the methods of work of the Special Committee. Concern was expressed at the lack of willingness of some States to engage in meaningful discussions to consider proposals that had long been before the Special Committee. It was stated that the Special Committee had been paralysed since 2022, as it had been unable to adopt substantive parts of its report owing to a lack of consensus among its members. 6. Delegations were encouraged to participate actively in the annual thematic debates, engage in constructive exchanges and ensure more interaction and thematic discussion. Delegations were also encouraged to use the annual thematic debates to share their best practices and successful examples of the use of procedures for the peaceful settlement of disputes. The importance of maintaining a balanced agenda was also highlighted to ensure that the work of the Committee was thoroughly documented and that all viewpoints, including divergent ones, were accurately reflected in the annual report. B. Identification of new subjects 7. The issue of the identification of new subjects was considered during the general exchange of views held at the 312th and 3013th meetings of the Special Committee, on 18 February, and at the 3rd meeting of the Working Group of the Whole, on 21 February. 8. During the general exchange of views, several delegations stated that the Special Committee could contribute to the examination of legal matters relating to the reform and revitalization of the Organization and its organs, including issues surrounding the roles and prerogatives of the General Assembly and the Security Council. The view was expressed that new subjects could assist in providing ways to improve the implementation of the Charter and strengthen the Organization and, in that connection, delegations were urged to exercise flexibility with reg",

During the general exchange of views, several delegations stated that the Special Committee could contribute to the examination of legal matters relating to the reform and revitalization of the Organization and its organs, including issues surrounding the roles and prerogatives of the General Assembly and the Security Council. The view was expressed that new subjects could assist in providing ways to improve the implementation of the Charter and strengthen the Organization and, in that connection, delegations were urged to exercise flexibility with regard to the inclusion of new subjects in the agenda of the Special Committee. Other delegations stressed that proposals must be practical and non-political, must not duplicate efforts elsewhere within the United Nations, must ensure the efficient and effective use of the time and resources allocated to the Special Committee and should be considered on the basis of the likelihood that they would enjoy consensus. 9. During the general exchange of views and in the Working Group, the delegate of Mexico introduced a further revised version of the proposal to include a new subject entitled \u201cDiscussion on the application of Article 51, in the light of its interrelation with Article 2 (4), of the Charter of the United Nations\u201d (A/AC.182/L.168) and announced that Brazil had joined as a sponsor. It was explained that the aim of the revised proposal was to create a focused space for a legal and technical discussion among all Member States to exchange recent practices that had an impact on the interpretation and application of Articles 2 (4) and 51 of the Charter. It was emphasized that the purpose of the proposal was not to conduct an analysis of specific cases, situations or communications submitted to the Security Council under Article 51 but should include the consideration of procedural A/AC.182/2025/L.9 3/5 25-02993 questions, including elements of the communications invoking those provisions, as well as ensuring the transparency and publicity of the communications, which was of relevance to the entire membership of the Organization. It was noted that, since the initial presentation of the proposal in the Special Committee, there had been an increase in the number of communications to the Council in which Article 51 had been invoked and that it had been invoked at least 78 times in the previous four years. 10. It was also emphasized that the proposal was not duplicative of or inconsistent with the work of other organs of the United Nations. It was noted that the Security Council often did not engage in a substantive debate concerning the invocation of Article 51, which was an impediment for States in asserting their views on the question and was different from the broad technical and legal discussion open to all Member States that was being proposed. The sponsor delegation thanked all those delegations that had expressed support for the revised proposal, or provided comments thereto, and expressed its readiness to revise the text, as necessary. 11. During the debate in the Working Group, a number of delegations expressed support for the revised working paper presented by Mexico and stressed the importance of the consideration of this topic. It was noted that the proposal touched upon important questions regarding international peace and security and questions on the scope of interpretation of Articles 2 (4) and 51 of the Charter of the United Nations. Several delegations considered that the Special Committee would be the appropriate forum to address the issues raised by the proposal since it concerned a matter within the scope of the mandate of the Special Committee that was of interest to all Member States. It was further pointed out that, as a sub-organ of the General Assembly, the Special Committee was more inclusive and transparent than other potential forums. Some delegations emphasized that, while the Security Council had primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, its competence was not exclusive. The two sponsoring delegations further announced plans to hold informal consultations on the proposal. 12. Some delegations reiterated their doubts regarding the proposal and questioned whether it fell within the scope of the mandate of the Special Committee and whether the Committee was the appropriate forum for addressing the issues raised. It was emphasized that Member States had a duty to report to the Security Council immediately when they acted in exercise of the right of self-defence and that the Council remained the primary organ for dealing with peace and security.",

It was emphasized that Member States had a duty to report to the Security Council immediately when they acted in exercise of the right of self-defence and that the Council remained the primary organ for dealing with peace and security. It was observed that notifications under Article 51 and responses thereto were already published on the website of the United Nations and in the Repertoire of the Practice of the Security Council. Some delegations noted that other parts of the United Nations system were better placed to discuss the issues raised and that the proposal was duplicative of efforts being made elsewhere within the Organization, such as through the convening of Arria-formula meetings and the work of the Informal Working Group on Documentation and Other Procedural Questions. A sponsor delegation noted that the discussion of the subject in the context of Arria-formula meetings, and the Informal Working Group on Documentation and Other Procedural Questions of the Security Council, remained informal exchanges and that there were limited opportunities for a meaningful exchange on the subject matter of the proposal. 13. At the same meeting, the Working Group considered the proposal for the inclusion of a new item concerning the role of the General Assembly in the Organization, as presented orally at the 2019 session of the Special Committee by the delegation of Cuba (A/74/33, paras. 88 and 89). The sponsor delegation requested a deferral on the consideration of the proposal to the following session of the Committee. No comments were made on the proposal. A/AC.182/2025/L.9 25-02993 4/5 14. During the general exchange of views and at the 3rd meeting of the Working Group, the representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran introduced a further revised version of its proposal to include a new subject entitled \u201cObligations of Member States in relation to unilateral coercive measures: guidelines on ways and means to prevent, remove, minimize and redress the adverse impacts of unilateral coercive measures\u201d (A/AC.182/L.167) and explained the technical update to the proposal made therein. The sponsor delegation emphasized that unilateral coercive measures constituted serious threats to the purposes and principles of the Charter, had no legal basis under international law and defied the rule of law at the international level, regardless of their nomenclature. It noted that unilateral coercive measures impeded the realization of and violated human rights, including the right to development, the right to life and the right to health. It was also noted that such measures threatened the international legal and economic order, inter alia, by hindering international cooperation, trade and investment and undermining the right and freedom of States to engage in international economic cooperation and to choose the forms of organization of their foreign economic relations. It was reiterated that unilateral coercive measures had adverse impacts on the humanitarian needs of affected populations, especially on the most vulnerable groups, while there existed humanitarian exceptions to various sanction regimes. The sponsor delegation reiterated its willingness to work on improving the proposal in cooperation with other delegations and emphasized that the proposal had been made with a view to having a technical discussion on the topic. 15. During the general exchange of views and in the Working Group, a number of delegations supported the inclusion of the proposal in the agenda of the Special Committee, noting that unilateral coercive measures were illegitimate, ineffective and punitive in nature, constituted a direct violation of international law and undermined the principles and purposes of the Charter. Some delegations expressed the view that the proposal had legal and practical implications and deserved serious consideration and expressed openness to discussing the substance of the application of unilateral coercive measures in the Committee. Emphasis was placed on the adverse effects of unilateral coercive measures and on the fact that they often affected vulnerable groups. Several delegations considered that unilateral coercive measures undermined both the enjoyment of human rights and sustainable development in the countries targeted, and reference was made to the ongoing work of the Special Rapporteur on the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights.",

Several delegations considered that unilateral coercive measures undermined both the enjoyment of human rights and sustainable development in the countries targeted, and reference was made to the ongoing work of the Special Rapporteur on the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights. The view was expressed that it could be helpful to subdivide the discussion of the topic into various issues related to unilateral coercive measures, such as the extraterritorial application of domestic law, the possible legal justifications for unilateral coercive measures, questions of the appropriate terminology and the overall lawfulness of the use of such measures. 16. Several delegations expressed doubts about the proposal. It was considered that the proposal was politically charged and that it had little prospect of generating consensus in the Special Committee, given the diverging opinions of Member States on the legal issues raised therein. Several delegations considered that sanctions other than United Nations sanctions were lawful and legitimate means for achieving foreign policy objectives and restoring peace and security. The view was expressed that sanctions were effective and highly targeted and were not directed at the general population, and that there existed several humanitarian exceptions to the existing sanction regimes. 17. During the general exchange of views, several delegations referred to the proposal made by the delegation of the Syrian Arab Republic delegation in 2020 to include a new subject, as contained in the working paper entitled \u201cPrivileges and immunities enjoyed by representatives of the Members of the United Nations and A/AC.182/2025/L.9 5/5 25-02993 officials of the Organization that are necessary for the independent exercise of their functions in connection with the Organization\u201d (A/75/33, annex III). Some delegations expressed support for the proposal, emphasizing the importance of the proper implementation of the Agreement between the United Nations and the United States of America regarding the Headquarters of the United Nations. The view was also expressed that proposals that raised bilateral concerns were outside the mandate of the Special Committee. 18. During the 3rd meeting of the Working Group, the Chair of the Special Committee announced that the sponsor delegation had requested that the Committee defer its consideration of the proposal to the following session of the Committee. There were no further comments on the proposal. 19. During the general exchange of views and in the Working Group, the representative of the Russian Federation referred to the proposal for a new subject submitted by Belarus, the Plurinational State of Bolivia, China, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, Equatorial Guinea, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Mali, Nicaragua, the Russian Federation, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, the Syrian Arab Republic and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, as contained in the working paper entitled \u201cChallenges to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations arising from initiatives promoting enhanced non-governmental organization participation in the work of the United Nations\u201d (A/AC.182/L.164). A sponsor delegation observed that, while non-governmental organizations (NGOs) were already participating in relevant United Nations meetings and processes, there existed insufficient diversity of geographical representation of civil society, with NGOs from developed countries having more access to the activities of the United Nations. Such a situation deepened inequalities between the developed and developing States, thereby adversely affecting the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. A sponsor observed that the prevalence of NGOs from developed States allowed them to shift the focus of United Nations bodies towards issues prioritized by Western nations. It further explained that there was a need to implement procedural reforms with a view to ensuring fair and equal geographical representation of NGOs and financial transparency, as well as to create a mechanism to hold NGOs accountable for abuse of United Nations processes. 20. During the general exchange of views, and in the Working Group, several delegations supported the inclusion of the proposal in the agenda of the Special Committee, noting the importance of equal geographical representation of NGOs.

It was also observed that the aim of the proposal was not to limit or exclude the participation of NGOs in the United Nations, and several delegations emphasized the goal of protecting the intergovernmental nature of the Organization. The view was also expressed that NGOs should work at the level of States rather than the United Nations. 21. Several delegations indicated that they were not in a position to support the proposal. It was observed that independent civil society organizations played an important role in assisting the United Nations in achieving its purposes and that NGO involvement should, if anything, be further strengthened. Several delegations noted that the participation of civil society brought new perspectives and improved the outcomes of the work of the United Nations. A number of delegations expressed the view that NGO participation did not expand inequalities but reduced them, while providing a voice for the most vulnerable, thereby contributing to the protection of human rights and holding Governments accountable. Some delegations considered that concerns regarding the accreditation of NGOs were better suited to consideration by the Committee on Non-Governmental Organizations of the Economic and Social Council or in the context of the modalities for a particular conference.",

Peaceful settlement of disputes 1. The Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization considered the question of the peaceful settlement of disputes during the general exchange of views held at its 312th and 313th meetings, on 18 February 2025, and during the 2nd meeting of the Working Group of the Whole, on 20 February. 2. During the general exchange of views and in the Working Group of the Whole, delegations expressed their support for all efforts to promote the peaceful settlement of disputes. Delegations recalled that States should refrain from the threat or use of force and instead settle disputes by peaceful means pursuant to Articles 2, paragraph 3, and 33 of the Charter of the United Nations. 3. Delegations highlighted the significance of the Manila Declaration on the Peaceful Settlement of International Disputes1 and the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.2 Several delegations emphasized the right of States to choose freely a peaceful means to settle international disputes and maintained that those means should be used in good faith and on the basis of the mutual consent of the parties to the dispute, and should not be subject to abuse. 4. Several delegations asserted the importance of preventive diplomacy in conflict prevention and the peaceful settlement of disputes. Several delegations also pointed out the importance of multilateralism and the role of regional arrangements in the peaceful settlement of disputes. 5. Several delegations reaffirmed the role of the International Court of Justice, as the principal judicial organ of the United Nations, in promoting the peaceful __________________ 1 General Assembly resolution 37/10, annex. 2 General Assembly resolution 2625 (XXV), annex. A/AC.182/2025/L.6 25-02951 2/3 settlement of disputes. The usefulness of the Court\u2019s advisory opinions on legal questions was also noted. Some delegations expressed their views on particular proceedings before the Court and stressed the importance of the implementation of the decisions of international adjudicative bodies. 6. A number of delegations stated that the annual thematic debate on the means for the settlement of disputes contributed to the more efficient and effective use of peaceful means and promoted a culture of peace among Member States, and they voiced their support for the Special Committee\u2019s continuing to analyse all means envisaged in Article 33 of the Charter. A number of delegations encouraged Member States to actively take part in the annual thematic debate and share their best practices and successful examples regarding the use of peaceful means of dispute settlement. 7. Delegations reiterated their preference that, in accordance with the mandate of the Special Committee, the question of the peaceful settlement of disputes remain on its agenda. A. Means for the settlement of disputes: exchange of information on State practices regarding the use of procedures envisaged in the Charter and other international instruments 8. In accordance with paragraph 5 (a) of General Assembly resolution 79/125, delegations focused their debate on the subtopic \u201cExchange of information on State practices regarding the use of procedures envisaged in the Charter and other international instruments\u201d. Reference was made to the document entitled \u201cExplanatory note by the Non-Aligned Movement on the identification of \u2018other peaceful means\u2019 of pacific settlement of disputes in Article 33 (1) of the Charter of the United Nations adopted in paragraph 5 (b) of General Assembly resolution 77/109\u201d (A/AC.182/L.162). 9. Delegations reiterated the importance that they attached to all peaceful means for the settlement of international disputes and supported efforts in promoting such means. Several delegations observed that the Charter of the United Nations, in particular Article 33, and the Manila Declaration on the Peaceful Settlement of International Disputes of 1982 provided a comprehensive toolkit of non-judicial means for the peaceful settlement of disputes. It was recalled that the list of means in Article 33 of the Charter was not an exhaustive one. General Assembly resolution 57/26, entitled \u201cPrevention and peaceful settlement of disputes\u201d was also recalled.",

The importance was highlighted of the principles of State consent, sovereign equality, territorial integrity, non-use of force, non-interference and good faith in the peaceful settlement of disputes. 10. Several delegations highlighted instances in which they had used or participated in non-judicial means of international dispute settlement, including negotiation, conciliation, mediation and good offices. The contributions of international organizations, including both the United Nations and regional organizations, in facilitating the settlement of international disputes were underscored. 11. Delegations also generally recalled the importance of judicial means of dispute settlement. The view was expressed that non-judicial means of dispute settlement complemented rather than replaced judicial dispute settlement. The possibility to pursue non-judicial means while judicial proceedings were pending in respect of the same dispute was noted. The relevance of the advisory function of international courts and tribunals was also highlighted. Furthermore, some delegations emphasized the A/AC.182/2025/L.6 3/3 25-02951 importance of the International Criminal Court to the rule of law at the international level. 12.

This penultimate report presents results from the first three years of implementing the Strategic Plan. It is accompanied by various annexes, including the Transparency Portal, which provides additional detail on the Entity\u2019s results, an annex on the implementation of the quadrennial comprehensive policy review of operational activities for development of the United Nations system, and an annex on the independent oversight functions/ bodies in UN-Women. Elements of a draft decision are presented in section VII. UNW/2025/2 25-05955 2/25 I. Introduction 1. UN-Women\u2019s work with its partners in 2024 affirmed more strongly than ever the centrality of its mandate and the imperative of gender equality in a challenging global context. Long-established inequalities interacted with rising geopolitical tensions, alongside accelerated technological change and ever more complex conflicts. Global developments presented both opportunities and threats to women and girls, with UN-Women and its partners working tirelessly to realise the former and mitigate the latter. 2. While many countries saw a backlash against women\u2019s rights, the movement for gender equality remained robust and energetic from global multilateral spaces to the work of grassroots women\u2019s organisations, supported at every level by UN-Women. Carrying out its triple mandate, and with investments of $622.8 million in 109 countries/territories, the Entity secured tangible results for women and girls across all four impact areas of the Strategic Plan 2022\u20132025 as laid out in this report. Further, it continued down the path of organizational improvement and transparency, with measurable improvements in effectiveness and efficiency that equip it to continue to better deliver results for women and girls everywhere. 3. While advances occurred, developing countries continue to confront a staggering annual gender financing gap of $420 billion. Over 3.3 billion people live in countries where debt interest payments now exceed expenditures on health or education. This disproportionately affects women, with only 18 per cent of social protection measures adopted by governments since 2022 targeting women\u2019s economic security. In 2024, UN-Women supported 70 countries to increase financing for gender equality and 50 countries to transform care systems through long-term financing, more comprehensive data collection, strengthening normative and policy frameworks, and shifting discriminatory social norms. The 2024 Commission on the Status of Women underscored the critical need to finance gender equality, and highlighted the centrality of social protection, public services and sustainable infrastructure in addressing poverty among women and girls. In 2025, the Fourth International Conference on Financing for Development presents a crucial opportunity for Member States to advance commitments and reform the international financial architecture so it is fit for purpose to mobilize resources for the full implementation of the SDGs. 4. Violence against women persists at alarming levels, with an estimated 140 women and girls killed every day by a family member. Increasingly, technology is weaponized to harm women and girls. Anti-rights actors use online spaces to attack women\u2019s rights, fuel misogyny and normalize violence, while artificial intelligence facilitates the insidious spread of targeted disinformation. Drawing on UN-Women\u2019s evidence and technical expertise, the United Nations General Assembly passed its first resolution on eliminating all forms of violence against women and girls in the digital realm. This comprehensive framework will further support national efforts to end such violence. Since 2022, with UN-Women\u2019s support, 30 countries have adopted, revised or repealed 148 laws to end violence against women. 5. Women\u2019s limited role in decision-making persists across all sectors and levels. In 2024, a \u201cmega-elections\u201d year, UN-Women worked with electoral stakeholders and civil society to facilitate women\u2019s strengthened participation and representation. Only 5 women were elected in 31 direct presidential elections.",

Since 2022, with UN-Women\u2019s support, 30 countries have adopted, revised or repealed 148 laws to end violence against women. 5. Women\u2019s limited role in decision-making persists across all sectors and levels. In 2024, a \u201cmega-elections\u201d year, UN-Women worked with electoral stakeholders and civil society to facilitate women\u2019s strengthened participation and representation. Only 5 women were elected in 31 direct presidential elections. Nevertheless, some notable successes occurred in countries where amendments to electoral laws and policies increased women\u2019s participation as voters and election to parliaments. General Recommendation No. 40 on the equal and inclusive representation of women in decision-making systems, adopted by the Committee on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women, galvanized experts, practitioners and civil society UNW/2025/2 3/25 25-05955 to amplify calls for women\u2019s equal representation. In 2024, UN-Women supported 67 countries, home to 2.7 billion women and girls, to strengthen the legal and policy environment to safeguard and advance women\u2019s rights. 6. More conflict-related deaths occurred from 2021\u20132023 than in the prior three decades. From 2013\u20132023, the number of women and girls living within 50 kilometres of armed conflict soared by 50 per cent. Despite evidence of the substantial benefits of women\u2019s engagement in securing sustainable peace, however, women remain grossly underrepresented in negotiations, comprising only 5 per cent of negotiators in tracked peace processes in 2023. In 2024, UN-Women continued to advance the women, peace and security agenda globally through the United Nations Security Council, Peacebuilding Commission and Counterterrorism Committee Member States. The Entity also partnered with regional organizations and supported eight new countries to adopt national action plans on women, peace and security. Consequently, 141.4 million women and girls in these countries stand to benefit from inclusive efforts to prevent conflict, build sustainable peace and reduce the impacts of violence. 7. In the last six years, globally, the estimated number of people forcibly displaced due to persecution, conflict and violence rose by 70 per cent; the number of refugees reached record levels. UN-Women worked with partners in 24 countries in fragile contexts to improve access to life-saving services for women and girls, including reaching nearly 470,000 individuals across eight Arab States. In 19 countries, the Entity co-led gender in humanitarian action working groups, increasing the presence of local women\u2019s organizations in Humanitarian Country Teams, and establishing and strengthening Women\u2019s Advisory Groups as a source of strategic guidance for United Nations emergency responses. With UN-Women\u2019s support, women and girls in 30 countries now benefit from the adoption of disaster risk reduction legislation, policies, strategies, plans and/or assessments undertaken, which seek to leverage their full potential for disaster prevention, preparedness and recovery. 8. Gender data gaps hinder gender equality by obscuring the lived realities of women and girls. As of March 2024, no country had complete data for all 52 gender- specific SDG indicators. Since 2016, UN-Women has prioritized strengthening gender data production and use, including to identify gaps, understand challenges and allocate resources effectively. This has resulted in a 30-percentage-point increase in data to monitor gender-responsive SDG indicators. In 60 countries in 2024, UN-Women supported the establishment of 72 coordination mechanisms to better produce and use gender data. 9. At a time of intense backlash, UN-Women\u2019s coordination mandate is more essential than ever to uphold women\u2019s rights. In 2024, the United Nations Secretary- General launched the Gender Equality Acceleration Plan, a flagship initiative marshalling the entire United Nations system around accelerated progress on gender equality. UN-Women serves as the secretariat for the plan and lead entity for half its accelerators. Full and faithful implementation will make an indispensable contribution to achieving the gender-dimensions of the SDGs and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development more broadly. 10. In a challenging and polarised world, UN-Women played an instrumental role convening Member States, civil society and women\u2019s movements demanding change \u2013 including Indigenous, Afro-descendent, environmental and human rights defenders \u2013 to keep gender equality at the forefront of intergovernmental decision- making.",

In a challenging and polarised world, UN-Women played an instrumental role convening Member States, civil society and women\u2019s movements demanding change \u2013 including Indigenous, Afro-descendent, environmental and human rights defenders \u2013 to keep gender equality at the forefront of intergovernmental decision- making. The Entity\u2019s engagement resulted in the strong reflection of gender equality in the Pact for the Future and its annexes, including the Global Digital Compact. Efforts to protect and advance women and girls\u2019 rights were further reflected in extensive support to Member States to prepare for the 30-year review of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. Other noteworthy achievements included UNW/2025/2 25-05955 4/25 commitments at the 2024 Rio Convention Conference of Parties (COPs) on biodiversity, climate change, and desertification to realize inclusive agendas, stepped-up financing mechanisms and more sustainable blue and green economies. 11. Striking the right balance between meeting the immediate needs of women and girls and dismantling structural causes of gender inequality remains a challenge. The latter, which depends on undoing the harm of centuries of discrimination, is a formidable task amid acute funding shortfalls and forceful anti-rights headwinds. With the global landscape continuing to evolve, UN-Women has implemented measures to boost organizational effectiveness, agility and efficiency. Contributions through Strategic Notes, a flexible funding modality essential for the effective fulfilment of the Entity\u2019s mandate, increased in 2024. In total, UN-Women received $593 million in contributions, reflecting sustained trust and confidence among its partners. 12. In 2025, the final year of its Strategic Plan, UN-Women will work with unwavering conviction. Side-by-side with Member States, civil society organizations, United Nations entities, private and public partners, and women worldwide, it will advance gender equality and women\u2019s rights as integral to realizing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. II. Key aggregate results of the Strategic Plan (2022-2024) In 83 countries, home to 2.9 billion women and girls, UN-Women successfully worked with national partners to strengthen the legal and policy environment protecting their rights 325 laws adopted, revised or repealed to further advance and protect the rights of women and girls, in line with international norms and standards Over 16,600 organizations across 95 countries with strengthened capacities to deliver quality goods, services, and resources for women across the humanitarian-development-peace continuum 68 countries adopted 490 gender-responsive national and local multi-sectoral policies, strategies and plans, addressing issues such as equal pay, the economy of care, violence against women, environment and climate change, and women, peace and security, potentially benefitting 2.7 billion women and girls More than $219.6 million disbursed to civil society organizations, local women-led organizations and networks, working towards the achievement of gender equality, including in conflict and crisis settings Over 10,000 processes and mechanisms \u2013 such as dialogues and coalitions \u2013 established in 104 countries to enable the meaningful and safe engagement of civil society representatives in policy design and decision-making 30 additional countries adopted strategies for the prevention of violence against women. These efforts are leading progress towards SDG indicators 5.2 and 5.2.2 to reduce the proportion of women and girls subjected to physical, sexual or psychological violence Entire communities \u2013 including 265.7 million women and girls \u2013 stand to gain from inclusive efforts to prevent conflict, build sustainable peace and reduce the devastating impacts of violence on their lives and communities, as outlined in the 18 new national action plans on women, peace and security adopted since 2021 UNW/2025/2 5/25 25-05955 90 per cent increase in the number of United Nations Country Teams who reported on the UNCT-SWAP \u2013 strengthening accountability of the United Nations system to women and girls 5,991 additional private companies (137 per cent increase since 2021) have now committed to fostering business practices that empower women through the Women\u2019s Empowerment Principles III.

Performance by impact area 13. In 2024, UN-Women supported 109 countries/territories to advance gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment. UN-Women achieved good performance (reaching at least 90 per cent of 2024 milestones) for 69 per cent of indicators with data available at the development results output level (Figure 1). Thirty-one per cent of indicators saw early achievement of 2025 targets. A. Impact 1: Governance & Participation in Public Life Total expenditure: $80 million Number of countries: 71 14. In 2024, a \u201cmega-elections\u201d year, only five women were elected in 31 direct presidential elections. Additionally, in 2024 women held heads of state and/or government positions in 27 countries (down from 31 countries in 2023). There were only marginal gains in other offices, with women holding 26.9 per cent of parliamentary seats, 35.5 per cent of local government positions (SDG 5.5.1) and 23.3 per cent of ministerial posts. UN-Women promotes inclusive political processes based on parity to nurture future generations of women leaders. In Jordan, constitutional amendments adopted in 2022 were implemented during the 2024 general election and resulted in the highest representation of women ever in Parliament. 11 11 7 29 6 16 11 33 9 4 5 18 1 9 2 12 1 1 2 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Met 2025 Target >= 90% Progress >= 60% Progress 0-59% Progress Data Not Available Please note: The figures in this report exclude 26 indicators that are only monitored at component or disaggregated levels or that are not assigned a 2024 milestone Organizational effectiveness and efficiency output indicators Development results output indicators Development results outcome indicators TOTAL Figure 1: Progress against 2024 Milestones UNW/2025/2 25-05955 6/25 15. In 2024, UN-Women supported Member States to advance laws for gender equality, including through the collection and analysis of data. UN-Women, the World Bank and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) continued to collect data on legal frameworks driving gender equality (SDG 5.1.1, now tier 1). UN-Women also supported legal reforms in 24 countries, including through technical and financial support provided by the Gender Justice Platform in partnership with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). 16. Advancing gender-responsive governance across sectors, including health, is integral to improving services for all women and girls. As girls aged 10 to 19 continued to account for the overwhelming majority of new HIV infections (70 per cent in 2023, only slightly down from 75 per cent in 2022), UN-Women strengthened HIV programming in 45 countries to facilitate equal access of women and girls to services as part of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (SDG 3.3.1). 17. Well-designed, gender-responsive public finance management systems are essential to implement gender equality commitments. In 2024, data collected by UN-Women, OECD, and UNDP for SDG 5.c.1 revealed that only 26 per cent of 121 countries and areas have systems to track gender resource allocations, unchanged from 2021, when the same percentage was reported across 105 countries. B. Impact 2: Women\u2019s Economic Empowerment Total expenditure: $81 million Number of countries: 70 18. Women\u2019s economic empowerment holds great promise and attracts increasing interest and investment. In 2024, UN-Women facilitated women\u2019s access to decent employment and social protection, strengthened care systems and gender-responsive procurement, and promoted equal pay for equal work or work of equal value, working alongside partners including the International Labor Organization (ILO), OECD, UNDP, and the Rome-based United Nations agencies. 19. SDG indicator 5.4.1 shows negligible progress, however, with 17.8 per cent of women\u2019s time spent on unpaid care and domestic work in 2023 (18.7 per cent in 2013), still more than double the share of men. UN-Women supported over 50 countries in 2024 to transform care systems through long-term financing, data collection, normative and policy frameworks, and shifting discriminatory social norms. UN-Women\u2019s support in Brazil led to the adoption of a National Care Policy which now enshrines shared caregiving responsibilities into law. Moreover, the first- ever United Nations system-wide policy on transforming care systems was launched by the United Nations Deputy Secretary-General, through an inter-agency effort led by UN-Women. 20.",

Moreover, the first- ever United Nations system-wide policy on transforming care systems was launched by the United Nations Deputy Secretary-General, through an inter-agency effort led by UN-Women. 20. Informal employment (SDG 8.3.1) continues to stagnate at around 55 per cent for women and 60 per cent for men. UN-Women promoted decent work and entrepreneurship for women in 40 countries through capacity development, partnerships, coordination and policy advocacy. 21. Access to social protection (SDG 1.3.1) remains a challenge globally, with widening gender gaps. Only 50.1 per cent of women are covered by at least one social protection benefit (compared to 54.6 per cent of men). UN-Women advanced gender- responsive social protection initiatives in 17 pathfinder countries through its active involvement in the Global Accelerator on Jobs and Social Protection, and co-leadership of its Technical Support Facility, alongside the Food and Agriculture UNW/2025/2 7/25 25-05955 Organization (FAO), ILO, United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), UNDP and World Food Programme (WFP). C. Impact 3: Ending Violence Against Women Total expenditure: $93 million Number of countries: 72 22. Global emergencies, conflicts and climate change have intensified drivers and risk factors associated with violence against women and girls. Digitalization is exacerbating violence across the online-offline continuum for women in public life, including women human rights defenders. Discriminatory social norms associated with gender roles and identities are becoming normalized in legislation and policy, creating new avenues by which to perpetrate violence. 23. In the review of the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action, 88 per cent of countries globally identified eliminating violence against women and girls as a priority for the next five years. In 2024, UN-Women leveraged this significant commitment into support for normative frameworks, including the regional Ibero- American Model Protocol for the Investigation of Cases of Sexual Violence and the adoption, revision or repeal of 31 laws across 10 countries on ending violence against women. The Entity also established a new programme of work on ending technology- facilitated violence against women and girls. 24. UN-Women convened strong multistakeholder partnerships to strengthen the evidence base to prevent violence against women and girls and the coordination of services through large-scale programmes such as the European Union\u2013UN-Women Advocacy, Coalition-Building and Transformative Feminist Action to End Violence Against Women and Girls (ACT) programme (undertaken in partnership with the United Nations Trust Fund to End Violence Against Women [United Nations Trust Fund]), Generation Equality Action Coalition on Gender-Based Violence and Spotlight 2.0. Notable results in 2024 included establishing the High-Level Network on Gender-Responsive Policing, chaired by the governments of Chile, Senegal and the Netherlands. As part of broader work on safeguarding women\u2019s rights, collaboration with global and regional human rights mechanisms, civil society, parliamentarians and traditional leaders in The Gambia helped to uphold a law banning female genital mutilation. D. Impact 4: Women, peace and security, and humanitarian and disaster risk reduction Total expenditure: $135 million Number of countries: 58 25. UN-Women continued to work alongside women to secure peace amid rising and protracted conflicts, delivering results in contexts ranging from Afghanistan, Mali and South Sudan to the State of Palestine and Ukraine. The Entity led the global coordination mechanisms on women, peace and security and the provision of policy expertise to the Security Council, Peacebuilding Commission, Counterterrorism Committee Member States and regional organizations. In Sudan, UN-Women supported a coalition of women peacebuilders to shape a peace agenda, in partnership with the African Union and the African Women Leaders Network. A UNW/2025/2 25-05955 8/25 total of 112 countries and territories now have national action plans on women, peace and security, including four first-generation plans adopted in 2024 (in Zimbabwe, Colombia, Ecuador and Viet Nam) with support from UN-Women.",

In Sudan, UN-Women supported a coalition of women peacebuilders to shape a peace agenda, in partnership with the African Union and the African Women Leaders Network. A UNW/2025/2 25-05955 8/25 total of 112 countries and territories now have national action plans on women, peace and security, including four first-generation plans adopted in 2024 (in Zimbabwe, Colombia, Ecuador and Viet Nam) with support from UN-Women. The low participation of women in peace processes, however, underscores the urgent need to implement existing commitments and provide financial resources. UN-Women launched the Women in Peace Processes Monitor in 2024, addressing a longstanding data gap on monitoring women\u2019s engagement in peace processes, thereby making visible this imbalance and informing advocacy efforts. 26. Through its Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) membership, UN-Women co-led the development of an updated gender policy to guide global standards in humanitarian action. With only 45 per cent of published humanitarian response plans outlining impacts and targeted approaches to assist and engage women and girls in 2024, down from 79 per cent in 2023, UN-Women is strengthening coordination, gender analysis and evidence-based advocacy to reverse this decline. Efforts included increasing the presence of local women\u2019s organizations in Humanitarian Country Teams in among other countries, Somalia and Yemen, and establishing and strengthening Women\u2019s Advisory Groups in Afghanistan and Sudan to enhance strategic guidance to Humanitarian Country Teams. Moreover, the UN-Women Emergency Funding Mechanism was activated 11 times in 2024, making disbursements across regions in over 10 countries. 27. UN-Women further continued investing in efforts to foreground the needs of women and girls and support their full engagement at all levels of decision-making in disaster risk reduction (DRR), working across 60 countries, in partnership with national governments, over 600 women\u2019s organizations and 49 United Nations entities. Joint efforts with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, led to the successful adoption of the Gender Action Plan for implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015\u20132030. Moreover, in 2024, following UN-Women\u2019s engagement, women and girls in 30 countries can benefit from the adoption of gender-responsive DRR legislation, policies, strategies, plans and/or assessments undertaken, which seek to leverage their full potential for disaster prevention, preparedness and recovery to build sustainable, secure and thriving communities. UNW/2025/2 9/25 25-05955 IV. Performance under the seven systemic outcomes E. Outcome 1: Global normative frameworks and gender-responsive laws, policies and institutions 28. In 2024, UN-Women supported Member States to strengthen global norms and standards for gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment. Gender perspectives were integrated in 60 per cent (55 per cent in 2023) of resolutions adopted by the General Assembly, Security Council and Human Rights Council, exceeding the 2024 target. The agreed conclusions of the sixty-eighth session of the Commission on the Status of Women, on the priority theme of demonstrating strengthened commitments to financing with a gender perspective, reflected 94 per cent of recommendations from the report prepared by the Secretary-General for the session. UN-Women supported 94 per cent of United Nations Country Teams to submit reports to the CEDAW Committee. 29. UN-Women supported the translation of global normative frameworks into gender-responsive laws, policies and institutions at all levels. This encompassed support to the adoption or revision of 77 laws to advance gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment, including constitutional amendments guaranteeing gender equality in Mexico, advances in transitional justice for women in South Sudan, the prohibition of child marriage in Sierra Leone, and expanded protections to stop violence against women in Guyana, Honduras and Mali. 30. Advocacy and technical assistance for parliaments and other national partners contributed to four new legal and policy frameworks promoting gender balance in elections and decision-making bodies. In the Central African Republic, the amended electoral code included parity in candidate lists for local elections. 31. UN-Women facilitated the adoption of 175 multisectoral national and local strategies, policies and/or action plans focused on gender equality. With the goal of strengthening institutions and the implementation of laws and policies, UN-Women deployed a multi-stakeholder approach and worked with over 1,000 partners, including grantees of the United Nations Trust Fu",

UN-Women enhanced gender expertise among national AIDS coordinating bodies in 27 countries, advancing skills for gender analysis and providing tools for promoting gender-responsive HIV policies, programmes and budgets. In Liberia, the AIDS Commission established a gender desk to support the national HIV programme. F. Outcome 2: Financing for gender equality 33. Despite the urgent need to invest in women and girls, developing countries face an annual gender financing gap of $420 billion. In many countries, debt servicing has crowded out investments in gender equality. The 2024 Commission on the Status of Women\u2019s agreed conclusions underscored the critical need to scale-up financing for gender equality. Accordingly, UN-Women worked in 20 countries to increase the proportions of national budgets allocated to gender equality. In India, the 2024 gender budget allocation represented 6.8 per cent of total government spending, approximately $3.8 billion, the highest amount in the history of gender-responsive budgeting in the country. In the United Republic of Tanzania, capacity development for 28 ministries, departments and agencies resulted in local government authorities including specific budget allocations for initiatives directly benefiting women in 2024\u20132025 budget plans. 34. UN-Women joined government partners to conduct nine gender financing assessments to quantify gender budget gaps in five countries: Albania, Ethiopia, India, the United Republic of Tanzania, and in Morocco, where work with key sectoral ministries led to the integration of gender-responsive budgeting principles into the 2025 Morocco finance bill. 35. UN-Women continued to strengthen the capacities of national partners to apply gender-responsive budgeting tools, reaching 548 state and non-state institutions in 2024. In Albania, civil society organizations developed budgeting watchdog reports on five local government units. Thirty-five national partners gained capacities to integrate women\u2019s voices into the budget cycle, which resulted in strengthened services for over 29,000 women survivors of violence, economic assistance to 8,090 female-headed households, and enhanced maternal and child health services, 87% >= 90% Progress >= 60% Progress 0-59% Progress UNW/2025/2 11/25 25-05955 benefiting over 51,500 mothers and children. Colombia experienced an impressive 40.94 per cent increase in public project markers that utilized the Gender Budget Tracker, resulting from UN-Women\u2019s collaboration with 19 local and departmental administrations. 36. Globally, UN-Women helped introduce 306 private financing instruments with gender objectives in 2024. With support from the Entity, Iceland issued the world\u2019s first sovereign gender bond of \u20ac50 million, setting a global precedent for leveraging capital markets to improve services and protection for low-income women. UN-Women assisted in introducing 27 private sector gender financing tools in 11 countries to integrate gender targets into portfolios, products and services, and backed blended finance mechanisms benefitting women\u2019s small and medium-sized enterprises. 37. In 2024, despite a challenging financial climate and decreased donor contributions, by applying the gender equality marker with UN-Women\u2019s support the Peacebuilding Fund allocated 43 per cent of its total disbursement to gender equality initiatives (down from 47.35 per cent in 2023), which nevertheless exceeded the 30 per cent target. G. Outcome 3: Positive social norms, including through engaging men and boys 38. Discriminatory social norms remain a stubborn and major barrier to gender equality. In 2024, UN-Women made significant progress in advancing global knowledge on social norms change, including through developing a framework for addressing discriminatory social norms on gender equality in diverse contexts.

Driven by an intersectional, feminist approach emphasizing the role of social institutions \u2013 the state, market, family and community \u2013 in sustaining social norms, the framework will strengthen UN-Women\u2019s work and inform the next Strategic Plan. 39. In 23 countries, UN-Women supported 101 programmes at the community and organizational levels in pursuing three pathways to change discriminatory social norms. 90% >= 90% Progress >= 60% Progress 0-59% Progress Figure 4: Progress towards 2024 milestones UNW/2025/2 25-05955 12/25 40. First, UN-Women facilitated dialogues and reflections within communities and organizations to encourage the questioning of discriminatory norms and the narratives that justify them. In Egypt, Jordan and Morocco, communities, private and public sector organizations were mobilized to challenge discriminatory norms around women\u2019s paid employment and men\u2019s involvement in unpaid care work. 41. Second, UN-Women supported advocacy to end discriminatory norms, strengthening women\u2019s rights movements and allyship, and creating a critical mass demanding change. In the Pacific, UN-Women bolstered coalitions of 13 national and international sports entities to eliminate discriminatory norms. Subsequently, the governing body for rugby in Samoa adopted a \u201czero-violence policy\u201d prohibiting all forms of gender-based discrimination by staff, management, coaches and referees. 42. Third, UN-Women created material conditions for changing discriminatory norms by facilitating legal and organizational policy reforms. As a result, 22 countries developed comprehensive national and subnational strategies to prevent violence against women based on uprooting the discriminatory norms that justify violence. In the United Republic of Tanzania, UN-Women joined other United Nations entities to support the promulgation of the National Clean Cooking Strategy, which recognizes the state\u2019s role in reducing unpaid care work and challenges the normalization of caregiving as women\u2019s responsibility alone. UN-Women continued fostering gender-inclusive workplace cultures in a range of countries. In Georgia, six government agencies rolled out sexual harassment prevention and response policies and mechanisms. In China, UN-Women strengthened the capacities of 10 national, provincial and local partners across diverse industries \u2013 including textiles, apparel and electronics \u2013 to address discriminatory workplace norms. Private sector engagement In 2024, UN-Women made significant strides in engaging with governments and the private sector to promote business environments that work for women. It worked with 11 governments in five regions to strengthen gender-responsive legislation, policies and regulations that uphold private sector accountability, including through the Women\u2019s Empowerment Principles. Strategic partnerships with the private sector resulted in substantial corporate investments in gender equality, with positive impacts on communities. In Nigeria, UN-Women established a $25 million fund to combat gender-based violence with robust support from private companies and international financial institutions. Private sector support to the Women\u2019s Entrepreneurship Expo expanded market access, financing and networks for over 5,000 women entrepreneurs across 20 countries in Europe and Central Asia. A pioneering partnership between UN-Women and the advertising industry through the Unstereotype Alliance aligned 240 organizations with $100.17 billion in global advertising expenditure promoting progressive social norms. Its landmark \u201cinclusion=income\u201d research irrefutably demonstrated that inclusive advertising drives sales and garnered media prominence. UNW/2025/2 13/25 25-05955 H. Outcome 4: Women\u2019s equitable access to services, goods and resources 43. UN-Women deepened investments in women\u2019s equitable access to services, goods and resources essential for livelihoods and well-being, although progress has been mixed. Gender inequalities in land rights demonstrate women\u2019s disparate access to resources, with men\u2019s land ownership at least twice that of women in countries with data. With the support of UN-Women and other partners, the United Republic of Tanzania has dedicated budgets for village land use plans to secure women\u2019s land ownership; 611 certificates on customary rights of occupancy were issued in just one district. 44.",

In 30 countries, UN-Women supported women farmers\u2019 organizations and cooperatives to address climate change. In Lebanon, internally displaced women using climate-resilient agroecological practices produced fresh food to supply collective shelters. 45. Surpassing the 2024 milestone, in 34 countries UN-Women advanced women\u2019s equal access to and use of services, goods and resources, including social protection. In Viet Nam, where informal employment accounts for 68.5 per cent of total employment, UN-Women supported the government in addressing gender gaps by expanding social insurance coverage, particularly to women who face disproportionate vulnerabilities including lower pay and care responsibilities. In Guatemala, UN-Women provided pivotal support to designing and applying an integrated care system road map 46. In 2024, thirty countries reported increases in the number of women accessing services after experiencing violence or discrimination. The Solomon Islands registered a 59.4 per cent annual growth in country-wide survivor-centred services for women and girls. 47. UN-Women worked in 29 countries on guidelines, protocols and standard operating procedures to strengthen essential services for survivors of violence, UNW/2025/2 25-05955 14/25 including in 88 municipalities in Bolivia. New multistakeholder initiatives to prevent and respond to sexual violence were undertaken in 25 countries, all focusing on sexual harassment. In India, UN-Women partnered with the government of the state of Tamil Nadu to establish the first Textile Industry Coalition to address sexual harassment and other forms of violence against women in textile supply chains. 48. Over 2,700 institutions in 52 countries gained capacities to deliver goods, services and resources for women including in Argentina, where UN-Women led a sub-national programme which enhanced the digital and financial skills of 2,504 rural and indigenous women entrepreneurs \u2013 representing a notable share of women driving local economies in remote areas. In C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, 33 institutions now have strengthened capacities to implement supply chain and procurement practices that empower women entrepreneurs. 49. Humanitarian action led by UN-Women improved access to life-saving services in 24 countries. In Afghanistan, Lebanon, Nigeria, and Ukraine, with UN-Women\u2019s support, 131,813 women accessed gender-based violence protection services, emergency livelihoods support, multipurpose cash assistance, and emergency food and non-food items. 50. UN-Women supported individuals, mainly women, in 46 countries to access gender-responsive legal aid, psychosocial support and other services, including over 17,000 women survivors of violence in the State of Palestine. Disability inclusion In 2024, UN-Women with United Nations entities, Organisations of Persons with Disabilities, and organizations and networks of women with disabilities addressed stigma, discrimination and violence against women and girls with disabilities. UN-Women and UNDP, in collaboration with the Global Disability Fund, created a new measure, The Women with Disabilities Stigma Inventory, along with accompanying resources, to assess the experiences of women and girls with disabilities. A policy brief outlined actionable and evidence-based recommendations that were piloted in Moldova, Pakistan, Samoa and the State of Palestine. Both the methodology and the policy recommendations were informed by data from national and cross-regional assessments of stigma and non-discrimination. Women and girls with disabilities engaged in and benefited from disability-inclusive programming to end violence against women through 62 projects supported by the United Nations Trust Fund. To connect disability inclusion, with the SDGs and its core leave no one behind principle, UN-Women joined the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions\u2019 Development Initiative to devise an auditing framework to address inequalities. UN-Women and the World Health Organization supported the strengthening of methodologies and the measurement of data on violence against women with disabilities, including through developing national capacities.

UNW/2025/2 15/25 25-05955 I. Outcome 5: Women\u2019s voice, leadership and agency 51. With the increasing backlash against women\u2019s rights and shrinking of civic space, UN-Women\u2019s work under this outcome area is more critical than ever. In 2024, the Entity continued to raise the alarm about the high rates of violence faced by women human rights defenders, journalists, peacebuilders and women in politics, as well as the rise in acts of intimidation and reprisals for cooperation with the United Nations. In a context of shrinking funding, UN-Women remained a key partner to civil society and women\u2019s organizations across all regions, providing $110 million via grantmaking mechanisms and programmatic partnerships. 52. UN-Women advanced women\u2019s leadership and agency, including through technical assistance that enabled 3,572 civil society and women\u2019s rights organizations in 47 countries to influence laws and policies, humanitarian responses and peacebuilding, and more than 190 policy processes. Some 3,000 diverse women aspirants and office holders have enhanced political leadership skills, including to prepare for local elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Papua New Guinea. 53. With 44 per cent of women aged 15 to 49 still lacking full control over their own bodies, both preventing reversals of gains and securing further progress is essential. UN-Women championed sexual and reproductive health and rights as foundational to women\u2019s decision-making. In 36 countries in 2024, the Entity strengthened the capacities of 35,000 women living with and affected by HIV to engage in decision-making in the HIV response. Under the European Union- UN-Women ACT programme, the Entity strengthened the capacities of young women from 21 countries in West and Centra Africa to mobilize on ending violence against women and girls. 54. In partnership with the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, Member States, regional organizations and women\u2019s organizations, UN-Women continued to advocate for women\u2019s meaningful participation in peace processes at all levels. In the Syrian Arab Republic, UN-Women collaborated with the Office of the Special Envoy to support the Women\u2019s Advisory Board to engage women in the political process. UN-Women worked in 32 countries to strengthen the capacities of local women\u2019s organizations to meaningfully engage in humanitarian planning and response processes; in 7 countries, these groups became members of Humanitarian Country Teams. 55. Facilitated by UN-Women, women\u2019s organizations participated in global normative fora, including the Commission on the Status of Women, the Summit of 107% >= 90% Progress >= 60% Progress 0-59% Progress UNW/2025/2 25-05955 16/25 the Future, and thematic and country-specific debates of the Security Council and Peacebuilding Commission. More than 5,000 civil society members attended the sixty-eighth session of the Commission on the Status of Women, the highest number on record. UN-Women supported civil society consultations in five regions to contribute to regional reviews of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action leading up to its thirtieth anniversary, ensuring review outcomes reflect the priorities of women and girls worldwide. Support to local women-led civil society organizations Despite global commitments, direct funding to civil society has dropped. UN-Women reaffirmed its commitment to support local women- led organizations with flexible funding through the United Nations Women\u2019s Peace and Humanitarian Fund and the United Nations Trust Fund. Together, these funds transferred over $48.2 million to 323 organizations and 344 women human rights defenders in 2024, strengthening resilience through institutional and long-term grants and capacity development. Over 40 per cent of partners accessed funding from the United Nations for the first time, and 59 per cent secured additional resources to respond to crises and advance peace and the elimination of violence against women and girls.

Over 40 per cent of partners accessed funding from the United Nations for the first time, and 59 per cent secured additional resources to respond to crises and advance peace and the elimination of violence against women and girls. J. Outcome 6: Production, analysis and use of gender statistics and sex-disaggregated data and knowledge 56. Data available to monitor the gender-responsive indicators of the SDGs has increased by 30 percentage points since 2016, reaching 56 per cent. The contributions of UN-Women to this strong result continued in 2024, influencing laws, policies and programmes in 22 countries. In Colombia, an extensive government effort to inventory properties across the country, supported by UN-Women, is helping advance peace agreement goals, including to expand the percentage of titled women landowners. In Georgia, findings from a Violence against Women Survey, supported by UN-Women, led to increased awareness and shelter donations, including from the private sector. Tonga\u2019s first gender and environment survey increased accountability for implementing its disaster risk management policy. 116% >= 90% Progress >= 60% Progress 0-59% Progress UNW/2025/2 17/25 25-05955 57. Critical gaps persist, however, with limited funding proving a particular challenge. Despite countries relying on external funding for over half their gender data activities, nearly half of OECD Development Assistance Committee members allocate negligible percentages of official development assistance to gender data- related efforts. Nevertheless, in 2024, gender statistics were integrated into 24 national plans, and 61 coordination mechanisms were established to enhance production and use. UN-Women supported 80 gender statistics initiatives, including 26 surveys on violence against women, time use, and gender and the environment. 58. In Afghanistan, Lebanon and the State of Palestine, UN-Women co-led the scaling up of eight inter-agency coordination mechanisms, building on data-driven gender analysis and knowledge products to integrate gender in humanitarian response planning and decision-making. 59. UN-Women led the production of cutting-edge gender data and research, launching key global reports that informed policy, advocacy and accountability efforts worldwide. The Gender Data Outlook 2024, co-produced with OECD, assessed gender data capacities across 83 countries. This informed priority-setting for gender data capacity development, including new initiatives to strengthen statistical systems and enhance data collection in Ethiopia and Nigeria. 60. UN-Women published Progress on the Sustainable Development Goals: The Gender Snapshot 2024, in collaboration with the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. This annual report continues to be a key resource for gender equality advocates to ensure accountability for the achievement of the Goals. UN-Women also drove accountability for gender equality financing and results through the Generation Equality Accountability Report 2024. Findings included that Generation Equality is propelling operational and normative results through over 12,000 new or scaled-up policies, programmes and advocacy initiatives. 61. The World Survey on the Role of Women in Development, compiled in collaboration with United Nations agencies and bilateral donors, was launched in 2024 and featured groundbreaking new data and analysis of social protection policies for women and girls. The report has informed policy dialogues with national governments convened by three UN-Women regional and multi-country offices. K. Outcome 7: United Nations system coordination for gender equality 102% >= 90% Progress >= 60% Progress 0-59% Progress UNW/2025/2 25-05955 18/25 62. The 2024 launch of the United Nations System-Wide Gender Equality Acceleration Plan signalled the increased commitment of the United Nations to advancing gender equality and women\u2019s rights. Delivering for women and girls amid uneven progress on the gender equality targets of the global Goals requires strong and sustained leadership by the United Nations. With its unique triple mandate, UN-Women has a pivotal role in driving this at both the institutional and programmatic levels. 63. At the institutional level, implementation of Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) resolutions on gender mainstreaming and the 2024 quadrennial comprehensive policy review (QCPR) is progressing. In 2024, 75 entities implemented the United Nations System-Wide Action Plan on Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-SWAP 2.0) and 17 entities the newly-launched UN-SWAP 3.",

At the institutional level, implementation of Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) resolutions on gender mainstreaming and the 2024 quadrennial comprehensive policy review (QCPR) is progressing. In 2024, 75 entities implemented the United Nations System-Wide Action Plan on Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-SWAP 2.0) and 17 entities the newly-launched UN-SWAP 3.0; 80 per cent of all ratings fell within the categories of meeting or exceeding requirements, surpassing the 2024 milestone. Challenges persist across the United Nations system, however. Only 43 per cent of entities have achieved gender parity for international professional staff and financial targets for gender equality were met by only 36 per cent of entities. 64. Building on earlier achievements by UN-Women to institutionalise the gender equality marker (GEM), 77 per cent of multi-partner trust funds and 77 per cent of joint programmes applied the GEM. Further efforts are needed around institutionalization and compliance across the United Nations system. 65. At the country level, the accountability of United Nations Country Teams for gender equality has been steadily growing. In 2024, 116 United Nations Country Teams, up from 97 in 2023, reported on the United Nations Country Team System- wide Action Plan (UNCT-SWAP) Gender Equality Scorecard. Among United Nations Country Teams with a new United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (Cooperation Framework), 44 per cent prioritized gender equality through mainstreaming or a stand-alone goal. In many cases this is a twin-track approach as in Namibia, Paraguay, Rwanda and Sierra Leone. 66. UN-Women continued to lead key global coordination mechanisms on women, peace and security. In 2024, the Security Council held a record number of meetings focused on women, peace and security, both thematic and country-specific. Moreover, the percentage of Council decisions that integrated language on women, peace and security increased despite a very challenging year, and UN-Women\u2019s Executive Director has briefed the Security Council 15 times in the last three years. 67. By leveraging its membership in the IASC and enhancing its coordination role on Gender in Humanitarian Action Working Groups, UN-Women has played a crucial role in ensuring that provisions for gender-based violence mitigation and response are included in 100 percent of published humanitarian response plans. 68. The leadership of UN-Women in promoting women\u2019s political participation, translated into joint United Nations Country Teams\u2019 initiatives coordinated on electoral processes, including in the Central African Republic, Iraq and Mexico. UNW/2025/2 19/25 25-05955 United Nations system coordination and the Gender Equality Acceleration Plan In 2024, the Secretary General launched the United Nations System- Wide Gender Equality Acceleration Plan to mobilize the United Nations to make system-wide efforts to achieve gender equality and to be accountable for progress. The establishment of the secretariat to steer the action plan within the office of the Executive Director of UN-Women recognized the Entity\u2019s coordination role on gender equality and leadership at country, regional and global levels. Key accountability frameworks, such as the UN-SWAP 3.0 and UNCT-SWAP, along with the unique technical expertise of UN-Women to advance gender-responsive Cooperation Frameworks, country gender equality profiles and the \u201cpush forward\u201d strategy, are among the vital components that will advance implementation of the action plan through six established working groups. These strategies should drive significant and timely advancements on gender equality and women\u2019s rights by the United Nations. L. Programme expenditures and types of contributions 69. Total expenditures in 2024 reached $622.8 million, compared to $551.3 million in 2023. Geographically, the highest expenditure was in the Asia & Pacific region ($133.9 million), followed by the East & Southern Africa region ($81.6 million) (Figure 9). 70. Among the outcome areas, global normative frameworks and gender-responsive laws, policies and institutions had the highest expenditure of $117 million, followed by women\u2019s equitable access to services, goods and resources with $98 million. $65.5 M $62.3 M $81.6 M $60.5 M $62.4 M $133.9 M Arab States West & Central Africa East & Southern Africa Europe & Central Asia Asia & Pacific UNW/2025/2 25-05955 20/25 71.",

By function, capacity development and technical assistance continued to be provided in most countries, followed by advocacy, communications and social mobilization (in 82 and 76 countries respectively). V. Strengthening organizational performance 72. To sustain continued impacts for women and girls in 2024, UN-Women remained highly focused on strong organizational effectiveness and efficiency, implementing $622.8 million, contributions received totalling $593 million. 73. UN-Women achieved good performance on QCPR indicators, with 85 per cent showing good performance. M. Output 1: Assuring an accountable organization through principled performance 74. Effective and efficient delivery of results remains a top priority for UN-Women, with the Entity in 2024 upholding high standards of accountability in managing resources aligned with its ambitions. 75. UN-Women received its thirteenth consecutive unqualified audit opinion for 2024, indicating strong internal governance and financial management. The Entity achieved a record 92 per cent implementation rate for external audit recommendations with no long-outstanding recommendations. For internal audits, long-outstanding recommendations stood at 3 per cent at the end of 2024, testifying to proactive management. UN-Women contributed to United Nations system-wide efficiency by leading inter-agency efforts to develop common policy guidance for financial instruments based on the International Public Sector Accounting Standards. 76. UN-Women enhanced its risk maturity and strengthened risk-informed decision- making by embedding risk management within planning, monitoring and reporting processes. 77.

Output 2: Advancing partnerships and resourcing; effectively influencing for impact and scale 78. In 2024, UN-Women successfully maintained and diversified its partnership base, which increased by 8 per cent compared to 2023. Although partnerships with civil society contracted slightly, UN-Women increased engagement with public sector institutions by 21 per cent, including local and regional governments. The Entity\u2019s private sector partners portfolio grew by 7 per cent, leveraging corporate capacity and resources to promote gender equality. More offices used an intersectional approach when engaging with young people, meeting the 2024 milestone. 79. Overall contributions received in 2024 grew 6 per cent compared to 2023, driven by growth in Other Resources. Regular Resources however, declined in line with similar drops across the United Nations system. In 2024, UN-Women national committees raised 35 per cent more resources from private donors, with 54 per cent of funds donated by individuals and the rest by companies and grant-makers. 80. UN-Women achieved record media reach, with 183 billion impressions, 14 million website page views and 577,610 new social media followers.

The Entity prioritizes linking results to resources, using funding as an investment to enable growth, shifting from traditional models and emphasizing organizational performance management. 82. Knowledge management is an organizational asset and UN-Women far surpassed the 2024 milestone, with 25 initiatives. The sharing of promising practices advances organizational learning and helps refine programmatic approaches and strategies and UN-Women will renew efforts to scale up innovative ways of working and knowledge networks in 2025. 83. Some aspects remain a challenge; in 2024, UN-Women did not meet office financial sustainability targets. In the current funding context, the organization will critically review its field presences for sustainability. The 2024 milestone was also missed for common premises. 84.",

The Entity had 138 nationalities among its staff in 2024, and 52 per cent of international professional staff were from programme countries, meeting milestones for both indicators. The representation of men increased and met the milestone. 86. UN-Women achieved the goal of having a dedicated human resources business partner in all regions. The Entity collaborated with the UNDP, UNFPA, UNICEF and the United Nations Office for Project Services to create harmonized progress reporting on the prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment. 87. Senior managers continued to actively champion disability inclusion, and UN-Women revised its Disability Inclusion Policy, enhancing business processes and decentralizing decision-making, including on mental health access. 88. While recruitments increased in 2024, the Entity narrowly missed the milestone for timely hiring and will address this in 2025. Q.

Marked by the thirtieth anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, the twenty-fifth anniversary of Security Council resolution 1325, the eightieth anniversary of the United Nations and 15 years since the founding of UN-Women, the Strategic Plan 2026\u20132029 will span four decisive years of the final stretch of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In the face of rising political polarization, persistent economic instability, protracted conflicts, and growing pushback on gender equality, it represents a critical opportunity to galvanize urgent progress for all women and girls. 93. Drawing on recommendations from the midterm review of the Strategic Plan 2022\u20132025 and subsequent corporate evaluations, audits and assessments, and guided by the 2024 QCPR, the new Strategic Plan is based on evidence and lessons learned.",

The new Strategic Plan will boost scale, impact and efficiency by further enhancing focus and integrated approach across the triple mandate and the thematic areas, including by streamlining the number of systemic outcomes. To amplify results and resources, UN-Women will revamp its approach to partnerships and capitalize on calls to action, including the Pact for the Future, UN 2.0 and the Gender Equality Acceleration Plan. 95. Grounded in CEDAW, the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, the women, peace and security agenda and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, among other human rights commitments, the Strategic Plan 2026\u20132029 will endeavour to accelerate the realization of the equality, empowerment and rights of all women and girls, sustaining momentum towards 2030 and beyond. VII. Elements for a draft decision The Executive Board may wish to, 96.

The purpose of the review is to enable the hybrid implementation, from 1 July 2025, of the framework established by resolution 2719 (2023) for the African Union Support and Stabilization Mission in Somalia (AUSSOM). Pursuant to resolution 2767 (2024), an independent strategic review was co-chaired by Maman Sidikou (Republic of the Niger) and Neil Cole (Republic of South Africa), with the support of a joint technical team comprising members from the African Union Commission and the United Nations Secretariat. The team held consultations in Mogadishu, Addis Ababa and New York, engaging in discussions with the Government of Somalia, troop-contributing countries and international partners. The report on the review was circulated in the last week of March 2025. Following consultations with the African Union, we are now in the final stages of assessing the recommendations of the independent strategic review. However, additional time is needed to complete that process. I therefore wish to request an extension of the deadline for the submission of the report, which I now intend to submit no later than 30 April 2025. I should be grateful if you would bring the present letter to the attention of the members of the Security Council. (Signed) Ant\u00f3nio Guterres",

Introduction 1. In adopting its resolution 2253 (2015), the Security Council expressed its determination to address the threat posed to international peace and security by Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant1 (ISIL, hereinafter referred to as \u201cDa\u2019esh\u201d)2 and associated individuals and groups and requested that the Secretary-General provide an initial strategic-level report on the threat, followed by updates every four months. In its resolution 2734 (2024), the Council requested that the Secretary-General continue to provide, every six months, strategic-level reports that demonstrate and reflect the gravity of the threat posed by Da\u2019esh to international peace and security and the range of United Nations efforts in support of Member States in countering the threat, particularly that reflect the impact of these efforts. It further requested that the latest biannual report of the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team pursuant to resolutions 1526 (2004) and 2253 (2015) concerning ISIL (Da\u2019esh), Al-Qaida and the Taliban and associated individuals and entities be annexed to the present report. 2. The present report is the twenty-first such report.3 It was prepared by the Office of Counter-Terrorism, with the input of the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate and in close collaboration with the Monitoring Team and other United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Coordination Compact entities. 3. During the reporting period, the threat posed by Da\u2019esh and its affiliates to international peace and security remained high. Despite sustained counter-terrorism pressure, the group continued to demonstrate resilience and adaptability, including through evolving tactics and geographic shifts in operational focus. The United Nations supported Member States in countering this threat, including through the implementation of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and relevant Security Council resolutions. __________________ 1 Listed as Al-Qaida in Iraq (QDe.115). 2 In line with General Assembly resolution 75/291. 3 See S/2016/92, S/2016/501, S/2016/830, S/2017/97, S/2017/467, S/2018/80, S/2018/770, S/2019/103, S/2019/612, S/2020/95, S/2020/774, S/2021/98, S/2021/682, S/2022/63, S/2022/576, S/2023/76, S/2023/568, S/2024/117, S/2024/583 and S/2025/72. S/2025/496 25-12039 2/14 II. Threat assessment A. Overview and evolution of the threat4 4. The threat posed by Da\u2019esh and its affiliates remained dynamic and diverse, with the highest intensity observed in parts of Africa. Da\u2019esh and its affiliates sustained a high level of propaganda output, which continued to serve as a tool for recruitment and fundraising, as well as for conveying strategic priorities. There were growing concerns about the threat from foreign terrorist fighters. 5. Da\u2019esh had still not officially confirmed the identity of its overall leader, who had adopted the name Abu Hafs al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi. The delayed confirmation may be due to concern that confirming his identity would make him a higher-priority target for counter-terrorism operations, or to avoid questions around his legitimacy. Some Member States continued to believe him to be Abdul Qadir Mumin (Somali) (not listed), head of the Karrar \u201coffice\u201d in Somalia); however, opinions remained divided. 6. Leadership attrition continued, notably with the death of Abdallah Makki Mosleh Al-Rafi\u2018i (also known as Abu Khadija) in March in Anbar Governorate in Iraq. Abu Khadija had held multiple senior roles, including that of deputy leader in charge of operational planning, as well as head of Da\u2019esh regional \u201coffices\u201d for Bilad al-Rafidayn (Iraq) and Ard al-Mubaraka (the Syrian Arab Republic, T\u00fcrkiye and the wider Levant). His death was not expected to destabilize the group\u2019s global network, which, in Member States\u2019 assessment, may absorb the impact and recover within six months. 7. In response to successive leadership losses resulting from counter-terrorism efforts, Da\u2019esh appointed new mid- to senior-level commanders. The rise of younger leaders, who were more skilled in the use of modern technologies, was expected by Member States and the Monitoring Team to influence the group\u2019s strategies. 8. Da\u2019esh activity in the Middle East was constrained by sustained counter- terrorism pressure, notably in Iraq and in the Syrian desert region. The situation in the Syrian Arab Republic remained fragile.",

      "text": "o successive leadership losses resulting from counter-terrorism efforts, Da\u2019esh appointed new mid- to senior-level commanders. The rise of younger leaders, who were more skilled in the use of modern technologies, was expected by Member States and the Monitoring Team to influence the group\u2019s strategies. 8. Da\u2019esh activity in the Middle East was constrained by sustained counter- terrorism pressure, notably in Iraq and in the Syrian desert region. The situation in the Syrian Arab Republic remained fragile. Since the fall of the Government of Bashar Al-Assad and the takeover led by Hay\u2019at Tahrir al-Sham (QDe.137), Da\u2019esh has been intent on destabilizing the interim authorities and exploiting existing vulnerabilities. Da\u2019esh members seized stockpiles of heavy weaponry (such as missiles, anti-tank systems and mortars) held by the previous Government, and over 500 detainees affiliated with Da\u2019esh were released from detention facilities following the change in power. Prison break incidents also occurred, during which Da\u2019esh detainees escaped. 9. Da\u2019esh maintained up to 3,000 fighters across Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic. In the latter, the group expanded covertly into populated urban areas near Damascus, operating through small mobile cells. The group also sought to incite sectarian tensions and ran multilingual campaigns aimed at discrediting the interim authorities. It attempted to recruit some dissatisfied local fighters, foreign terrorist fighters and former regime soldiers. Da\u2019esh carried out over 90 attacks across the Syrian Arab Republic, mostly targeting the Syrian Democratic Forces in the north- east of the country. On 22 June, an attack against a church in Damascus caused over 80 casualties. A preliminary investigation conducted by the interim authorities attributed the attack to Da\u2019esh, but the group had not claimed responsibility for it. __________________ 4 More information on the threat posed to international peace and security by Da\u2019esh and associated individuals, groups, undertakings and entities may be found in the thirty-sixth report of the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team submitted pursuant to resolution 2734 (2024) concerning ISIL (Da\u2019esh), Al-Qaida and associated individuals and entities (S/2025/482). S/2025/496 3/14 25-12039 Fighter affiliations in the Syrian Arab Republic remain fluid and frequently shift. Da\u2019esh is expected to continue projecting an external threat from the Syrian Arab Republic, where some of its key leaders remained based, if divisions in the country allow a permissive space from which they can plan and execute attacks. In Iraq, Da\u2019esh was working to rebuild its networks and restore operational capacity in the desert region and along the border with the Syrian Arab Republic. 10. The pivot of Da\u2019esh towards parts of Africa continued. These shifts were reflected in its operations and propaganda priorities. Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) (QDe.162) emerged as the most prolific Da\u2019esh propaganda producer, surpassing other affiliates in volume of content produced, while simultaneously supporting its regional branches in the Sahel and North Africa through its Furqan \u201coffice\u201d, headed by Abu Bakr ibn Muhammad ibn Ali al Mainuki (not listed). The group achieved some territorial gains within Borno State in Nigeria, where it conducted several complex attacks targeting security installations and civilians. Some Member States reported that ISWAP had between 8,000 and 12,000 fighters, with indications of an influx of some foreign terrorist fighters, mostly from West Africa, over the past year. 11. For its part, Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (QDe.163) remained confined to a relatively limited zone, but appeared intent on extending its reach, especially within Niger. The continued existence of this Da\u2019esh affiliate was bolstered by an informal truce with Jama\u2018a Nusrat ul-Islam wa al-Muslimin (QDe.159), an Al-Qaida affiliate, rooted in their shared objective of targeting Sahelian security forces. Since late 2024, Islamic State in the Greater Sahara demonstrated its intention to shift its activities toward the north-west border of Nigeria, relying on the group known locally as Lakurawa, which reportedly pledged allegiance to it. 12. While not operationally active in Libya, Da\u2019esh continued to maintain a foothold there, primarily through integration within transnational organized crime networks in southern Libya that are involved in the smuggling of arms and goods and the movement of fighters. Arrests by Libyan authorities (seven arrests performed in 2025 so far) revealed the presence of individuals tied to Da\u2019esh logistics and financial networks linked to the Sahel region. 13.",

While not operationally active in Libya, Da\u2019esh continued to maintain a foothold there, primarily through integration within transnational organized crime networks in southern Libya that are involved in the smuggling of arms and goods and the movement of fighters. Arrests by Libyan authorities (seven arrests performed in 2025 so far) revealed the presence of individuals tied to Da\u2019esh logistics and financial networks linked to the Sahel region. 13. In Eastern Africa, Da\u2019esh in Somalia launched on 31 December 2024 an attack on a base of the security forces in Dharjaale, Puntland region, in anticipation of a large-scale military counter-offensive supported by international partners. The attack was reportedly led almost entirely by foreign terrorist fighters of Arab origin, which highlights their key role and presence in Puntland region. During the counter- offensive by security forces, 200 Da\u2019esh fighters were killed and over 150 arrested. Member States estimated that over half of the 600 to 800 Da\u2019esh fighters in Somalia were of foreign origin, mostly from Eastern Africa, North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Member States were concerned that, without sustained counter-terrorism pressure, the threat may re-emerge. 14. Regional Member States estimated that the Da\u2019esh affiliate in Cabo Delgado Province of Mozambique, Ahl al-Sunna wal-Jama\u2018a (not listed), had 300 to 400 fighters. It remained resilient, conducting regular low-intensity attacks. Its centre of activity remained Mocimboa da Praia, Muidumbe, Mbau and Macomia, with two isolated attacks in the Niassa Special Reserve. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Allied Democratic Forces (Cde.001), led by Musa Baluku (not listed) and Abwakasi (CDi.040), operated in small, mobile combat units, avoiding prolonged presence in one location. 15. In Central Asia and Afghanistan, Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant-Khorasan (ISIL-K) (QDe.161) continued to represent the most serious threat, both regionally S/2025/496 25-12039 4/14 and internationally. With about 2,000 fighters, it continued to recruit from within and beyond Afghanistan, including from Central Asian Member States and the North Caucasus region of the Russian Federation, as well as from among disaffected fighters from other groups. Under the leadership of Sanaullah Ghafari (QDi.431), the group continued to prioritize attacks on Shia communities, the de facto authorities in Afghanistan and foreigners. While efforts by de facto authorities diminished ISIL-K\u2019s capabilities, the group continued to operate with relative impunity. Tamim Ansar Al-Kurdi (not listed) was head of the Da\u2019esh regional Siddiq \u201coffice\u201d overseeing ISIL-K and operations in Central and South Asia. There were increasing concerns about foreign terrorist fighters moving mainly from the Syrian Arab Republic to Central Asia and Afghanistan, aiming to undermine regional security. 16. Da\u2019esh continued to experiment with various communication platforms to glorify violence and promote an idealized life under the group\u2019s rule. It sought to exploit the reach and algorithmic influence of certain social media platforms \u2013 in particular to radicalize youth to terrorism and recruit them. The group also experimented with artificial intelligence to enhance propaganda efforts, primarily for radicalization to terrorism and recruitment to their ranks. Guidance had previously been issued by Da\u2019esh to its supporters on using generative artificial intelligence tools without being detected. Reports by Member States indicated efforts to recruit experts in cybersecurity to strengthen the group\u2019s capabilities in this domain. B. Situation of suspected Da\u2019esh members and their family members in conflict zones 17. In the north-east of the Syrian Arab Republic, approximately 34,800 individuals remained in the Hawl and Rawj camps and in detention and other facilities, including \u201crehabilitation\u201d centres; some individuals may have alleged links or family ties to Da\u2019esh. The population includes more than 6,700 Iraqi nationals, 15,500 Syrian nationals and 8,500 foreign nationals from approximately 62 countries. More than 60 per cent of that population are children, approximately 68 per cent of whom are under 12 years of age and 8 per cent are under 5 years of age. More than 11,590 of those children are foreign nationals, including more than 5,960 from Iraq and more than 5,630 from 59 other countries. In addition, more than 9,680 Syrian children are living in the Hawl and Rawj camps, and most have no meaningful access to legal remedy. Approximately 15 unaccompanied children reside in an interim care centre within Hawl camp. 18.",

In addition, more than 9,680 Syrian children are living in the Hawl and Rawj camps, and most have no meaningful access to legal remedy. Approximately 15 unaccompanied children reside in an interim care centre within Hawl camp. 18. The human rights and humanitarian situation of individuals arbitrarily held under deteriorating conditions in camps and in detention and other facilities, including \u201crehabilitation\u201d centres in the north-east of the Syrian Arab Republic remained a source of serious concern. The vast majority were being held incommunicado, with no information provided about their fate or whereabouts. 19. The fall of the Government of Bashar Al-Assad and the subsequent political transition in the Syrian Arab Republic resulted in increased instability in the security situation. Combined with cuts in foreign aid, this severely affected humanitarian operations at the Hawl and Rawj camps and increased the urgency of repatriating third-country nationals. III. Updates on responses to the evolving threat 20. The United Nations continued to support Member States in their efforts to counter the threat posed by Da\u2019esh, including through coordinated programming S/2025/496 5/14 25-12039 across multiple regions and thematic areas. On behalf of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, its Executive Directorate continued to conduct visits to Member States to assess and provide recommendations on the implementation of relevant Security Council resolutions. In the reporting period, six visits were undertaken, to Cameroon, Chad, Hungary, Malta, Norway and Somalia, respectively. A. Addressing the situation of suspected Da\u2019esh members and their family members in conflict zones 1. Repatriation efforts 21. The pace of repatriations increased significantly during the reporting period, with five Member States reportedly repatriating more than 5,970 individuals in total from the north-east of the Syrian Arab Republic, up from 760 in the previous reporting period. In addition, the Government of Iraq alone repatriated 6,890 Iraqi nationals from the north-east of the Syrian Arab Republic to a rehabilitation centre in Iraq. 22. The United Nations continued to assist the Government of Iraq in advancing rights-based return, rehabilitation and reintegration efforts for individuals repatriated from the north-east of the Syrian Arab Republic. On 30 January, the United Nations and the Government of Iraq launched the second One United Nations plan (2025\u2013 2027), supporting the latter\u2019s efforts to facilitate the return of all its remaining nationals by the end of 2025, with reintegration support extending through mid-2027. The United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) continued to support high- level political engagement with senior Iraqi officials, including within the security sector, to promote national ownership and coordination in the implementation of these efforts. 23. Various United Nations entities continued to provide complementary support to the Government of Iraq across the humanitarian, security and development dimensions of return, rehabilitation and reintegration. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) continued to support the Government of Iraq in the return, rehabilitation and reintegration of individuals, particularly those from Hawl camp, including the transitional rehabilitation of returnees at Amal Rehabilitation Centre (formerly Jeddah-1 camp). Since January, IOM provided legal assistance to approximately 1,000 individuals at the Centre and key areas of operation in the Anbar, Ninawa and Salah al-Din Governorates in Iraq, addressing civil documentation, housing and property rights, and protection services, including gender-based violence case management, as well as delivering psychosocial support services. 24. In January, the European Union-United Nations Global Terrorism Threats Facility, managed by the Office of Counter-Terrorism, concluded the first phase of its support to Iraq, responding to needs identified within the Global Framework for United Nations Support on Syrian Arab Republic and Iraq Third Country National Returnees. The support consisted of advisory services and the provision of training and information technology equipment to 54 security personnel to assist in the registration and screening of adult individuals seeking voluntary repatriation from Hawl camp. 2.

Prosecution and investigation 25. The United Nations continued to support Member States in strengthening rights- based legal and institutional frameworks for the investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences. The Office of Counter-Terrorism, in cooperation with the Office of the National Security Adviser of Iraq, strengthened the capacity of 143 Iraqi security officials in Basrah and Baghdad, as well as in Ninawa, Kirkuk and Diyala, S/2025/496 25-12039 6/14 governorates that are among the most affected by Da\u2019esh, through training to investigate terrorist offences in compliance with suspects\u2019 rights, with the goal of reducing reliance on confessions. The Office of Counter-Terrorism conducted the first training with the National Center for International Judicial Cooperation, which leads investigations into Da\u2019esh crimes, marking a significant step in engaging with the Center to strengthen cooperation on accountability and justice. As part of these trainings, the Office of Counter-Terrorism also supported dialogues between security forces and the High Commission for Human Rights of Iraq to foster a culture of rights compliance in the investigation and prosecution of terrorist cases. 26. UNAMI and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights monitored the investigative hearings of 32 detainees as well as the trials of 88 detainees in Iraq as part of their efforts to promote fair trial rights in criminal and terrorism cases. The detainees, all adult men suspected of involvement in Da\u2019esh crimes, included 101 individuals who had been transferred from detention facilities in the north-east of the Syrian Arab Republic to Iraq. 27. In January and March, in Malawi, the Global Terrorism Threats Facility contributed to the ongoing development of new counter-terrorism legislation by supporting a series of three round tables in Lilongwe and three national consultative workshops convened by the Law Commission, which brought together representatives of national and local government agencies, civil society and the private sector. 28. In April, the Office of Counter-Terrorism and the Government of Kazakhstan organized a cross-regional dialogue on prosecution, rehabilitation and reintegration in partnership with the United Nations Regional Centre for Preventive Diplomacy for Central Asia and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. The dialogue convened 116 government and civil society representatives from eight countries from the Middle East and North Africa, Central Asia and South-East Asia to discuss good practices and ongoing challenges related to the repatriation of individuals from conflict zones and prosecution, rehabilitation and reintegration processes. 3. Rehabilitation and reintegration 29. Throughout the reporting period, the Office of Counter-Terrorism, in collaboration with the Department of Peace Operations, developed action-oriented recommendations on programmatic interventions related to individuals associated with terrorist groups in the Lake Chad basin and the Sahel region, with a focus on the coherent and effective operationalization of prosecution, rehabilitation and reintegration and disarmament, demobilization and reintegration. The report was based on more than 100 consultations with government officials and United Nations entities working on these issues in these regions and will serve to inform the United Nations framework of joint support for Lake Chad basin and the Sahel. 30. In April 2025, the Office of Counter-Terrorism held a training for 31 practitioners working in the Amal Rehabilitation Centre in Iraq on the rehabilitation of Iraqi nationals returning from the north-east of the Syrian Arab Republic, focusing on key disengagement principles and engagement techniques to support client-led behavioural change. The training was based on a curriculum developed by the Office of Counter-Terrorism. 31. The Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) provided specialized training on mental health and psychosocial support for practitioners in Iraq working with children returned from the Syrian Arab Republic. It also supported capacity-building efforts in Burkina Faso, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mozambique, Nigeria, S/2025/496 7/14 25-12039 Tajikistan, the United Republic of Tanzania and Uzbekistan to strengthen the in",

B. International and regional cooperation 32. The United Nations, Member States and international and regional organizations continued to strengthen international and regional counter-terrorism cooperation, with notable progress made in Africa and Central Asia. In June, the Conference of West African Experts on Countering Terrorist Threats to Vulnerable Targets, held under the Global Programme on Countering Terrorist Threats against Vulnerable Targets led by the Office of Counter-Terrorism, resulted in the creation of a regional working group of experts from Benin, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Mauritania, Morocco, Senegal and Togo. 33. United Nations entities promoted technical-level cooperation through the exchange of good practices and national experiences, contributing to more effective counter-terrorism approaches. As part of these efforts, the Global Terrorism Threats Facility facilitated a study visit to Nigeria for representatives of the Tubsan National Centre for Preventing and Countering Violent Extremism of the Federal Government of Somalia. The visit enabled direct learning from the experience of Nigeria in managing voluntary defections from terrorist groups. 34. Technical assistance expanded through support by the Global Terrorism Threats Facility to Iraq, Kenya, Kyrgyzstan, Malawi, Maldives, Nigeria, Somalia, Tajikistan and Uganda, at their request and based on needs identified by the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate. The support was focused on detecting, preventing, responding to and investigating terrorist threats. 35. Criminal justice cooperation was strengthened through support provided by the United Nations. UNODC facilitated coordination among criminal justice officials and organized high-level dialogues between Maldivian and Sri Lankan authorities on terrorism cases and bilateral agreements. UNODC also provided technical assistance to improve mutual legal assistance and digital evidence-sharing frameworks. 36. The United Nations supported Member States in advancing inclusive, multi-stakeholder approaches to prevent and counter violent extremism conducive to terrorism, with a focus on regional cooperation and community resilience. In Turkmenistan, the United Nations Development Programme, together with the Government of Japan, the European Union and Hedayah, strengthened partnerships across borders and sectors, ensuring a people-centred approach to building resilient communities for the prevention of violent extremism conducive to terrorism and addressing the drivers of radicalization to terrorism. 37. To promote multilateral cooperation, the Office of Counter-Terrorism, in partnership with the Government of Austria and the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, organized policy dialogues on the nexus between counter- terrorism, preventing and countering violent extremism conducive to terrorism, and peacebuilding. The dialogues, which were intended to inform the 2025 review of the peacebuilding architecture and the ninth review of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, in 2026, brought together Member States, regional organizations, civil society and entities of the United Nations Global Counter- Terrorism Coordination Compact. The first two sessions, held in January, in New York, and in June, in Vienna, focused on terrorism as a driver of conflict and on rule of law and human rights-based approaches.

The United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Coordination Compact, comprising 46 entities, continued to coordinate United Nations efforts to prevent and counter terrorism and violent extremism conducive to terrorism. In February, the Coordination Committee of the Compact adopted a decisions document that contained a reaffirmation of United Nations support for the implementation of action 23 of the Pact for the Future (General Assembly resolution 79/1), in which Member States committed to pursuing a future free from terrorism. 39. On 25 June, the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Coordination Compact held a retreat with regional organizations on the implementation of action 23 of the Pact for the Future. The Under-Secretary-General for Counter-Terrorism highlighted the commitment to mutual accountability, regional ownership and sustainable partnerships through the Compact and invited regional organizations to co-lead future initiatives. The Special Representative for Iraq and Head of UNAMI delivered a keynote presentation on the role played by the integrated special political mission in aligning United Nations engagement with regional organizations. Key outcomes included consensus on a structured approach to regional engagement on preventing and countering terrorism and consensus on regionally aligned, human rights-based and gender-responsive approaches. An outline action plan was also agreed to guide implementation through the Coordination Compact. D. Supporting the victims of Da\u2019esh 40. The United Nations advanced efforts to promote the rights and voices of victims of terrorism. On 28 April, the Office of Counter-Terrorism, in partnership with Spain and with support from the Group of Friends of Victims of Terrorism, launched the victims of terrorism associations network, uniting over 120 victims and survivors from six continents, including victims of Da\u2019esh. The platform enables victims, their associations and civil society to share good practices, develop trauma-informed tools and build advocacy skills. The launch helped to raise awareness of victims\u2019 rights and amplify their voices in counter-terrorism discourse. 41. UNODC continued to support Iraqi victims of terrorism, organizing national meetings aimed at strengthening advocacy capacity, supporting long-term recovery from the impact of terrorist acts and promoting accountability. UNODC-facilitated national inter-agency coordination meetings led to the development of a comprehensive guide on victims\u2019 rights and access to justice, which was aimed at improving institutional coordination and ensuring victim-centred approaches by national authorities. 42. IOM continued its support for the implementation of the Yazidi Survivors Law in Iraq, which includes the ongoing operation of the comprehensive mental health and psychosocial support referral system under the framework of the Law. As of April, the system had provided monthly compensation to more than 2,350 survivors, while approximately 200 survivors had accessed free psychosocial services through local non-governmental organizations. E. Border management and law enforcement 43. In March, the Office of Counter-Terrorism, in collaboration with UNODC and the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, held a high-level event on the S/2025/496 9/14 25-12039 human rights provisions of the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. The event raised awareness among 200 participants of the importance of upholding and promoting human rights while countering nuclear terrorism. 44. In response to the growing threat posed by the illicit proliferation of small arms and light weapons in fuelling terrorism and organized crime across Africa, the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate published an analytical brief 5 identifying key gaps and challenges in weapons and ammunition management. The brief highlighted four critical areas of concern, namely, gaps in legal frameworks, insecure stockpiles, limited baseline assessments and inadequate tracing capacity, and emphasized the need for strengthened regional cooperation and border management to curb cross-border arms flows and disrupt the enabling environment for terrorist groups. 45. To prevent terrorists from acquiring weapons, the Office of Counter-Terrorism continued to support Member States in Central Asia with the implementation of Security Council resolution 2370 (2017). From January to June 2025, the Office engaged in the development of technical guidelines to counter terrorist acquisition of weapons including improvised explosive devices, unmanned aircraft systems and small arms and light wea",

To prevent terrorists from acquiring weapons, the Office of Counter-Terrorism continued to support Member States in Central Asia with the implementation of Security Council resolution 2370 (2017). From January to June 2025, the Office engaged in the development of technical guidelines to counter terrorist acquisition of weapons including improvised explosive devices, unmanned aircraft systems and small arms and light weapons. In May and June, the Office of Counter-Terrorism and UNODC organized four national seminars benefiting over 50 participants from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan on good practices for strengthening coordination on combatting the illicit trafficking of small arms and light weapons and their supply to terrorists. 46. As terrorists continued to leverage unmanned aerial systems in their operations, the United Nations continued to support Member States in strengthening operational capabilities to prevent and respond to terrorism. In the reporting period, the Office of Counter-Terrorism coordinated the delivery of 16 unmanned aerial systems and high- precision imaging payloads to national entities in Senegal with responsibility for counter-terrorism. These assets will enhance the operational capacity of the national authorities to safely and securely operate non-lethal unmanned aerial systems, improving border surveillance, reconnaissance and the collection of high-resolution imagery and other data to support intelligence-led efforts to detect and disrupt terrorism-related activities. 47. The United Nations continued to deliver support to Member States in their efforts to counter the movement of terrorists across borders, including by enhancing passenger data capabilities and cross-border cooperation. The United Nations Countering Terrorist Travel Programme, led by the Office of Counter-Terrorism, provided comprehensive and tailored assistance to 67 Member States in legislative, operational and transport industry engagement and technical areas. As part of this support, the Programme delivered capacity-building on operational processes, inter-agency cooperation and the use of the United Nations-owned goTravel software in Nigeria, the Philippines and the Republic of Moldova for more than 100 law enforcement officials who now have an enhanced understanding of and technical expertise on the use of passenger data to counter terrorist travel. With technical assistance from the Programme, the Republic of Moldova established its Passenger Information Unit in March, becoming the seventh Member State to do so, and launched the goTravel software, which provides the technical capability to collect and analyse passenger data for counter-terrorism purposes as well as to identify potential links between terrorist organizations and transnational criminal groups. In April, the __________________ 5 United Nations, Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate, \u201cWeapons management challenges in the context of terrorism and counter-terrorism in Africa\u201d, CTED analytical brief, January 2025. S/2025/496 25-12039 10/14 Programme supported the launch of the East Africa regional working group on advance passenger information and passenger name record to enhance Member State cooperation in countering terrorist mobility. 48. The Global Programme on Countering Terrorist Threats against Vulnerable Targets, led by the Office of Counter-Terrorism, implemented 19 technical assistance, outreach and capacity-building activities at the global, regional and national levels aimed at supporting the efforts of Member States to strengthen the security of critical infrastructure and public places. At the national level, tailored assistance was provided to over 100 officials from Benin, Mauritania and Senegal. For example, in April, the Global Programme held an event in Dakar to launch the Government\u2019s road map for countering terrorist threats against vulnerable targets and provided introductory capacity-building on the protection of critical infrastructure and public spaces. The Programme, in partnership with the International Maritime Organization, worked with the Government of Mauritania to enhance capacity development on protecting hydrocarbon infrastructure and maritime and port facilities from terrorist attacks. 49.

The Global Terrorism Threats Facility and the Global Programme, on the basis of the road map (national action plan) on the protection of vulnerable targets that the Global Programme developed with Kyrgyzstan, provided technical advice to the Anti-Terrorism Centre of Kyrgyzstan for the development of a secure online platform for the collection and analysis of information with the aim of enhancing the protection of vulnerable targets from terrorist attacks. 50. The Global Programme also collaborated with the Counter-Terrorism Preparedness Network to hold an expert meeting in London in February with 33 participants from 10 Member States to inform the development of a joint technical guide on good practices to enhance security at urban transport hubs. 51. On 5 March, the Office of Counter-Terrorism and the Government of France held a high-level event on protecting major sporting events from terrorist threats, which included a focus on innovative technologies, human rights safeguards and gender inclusion. The event brought together more than 1,400 participants from Member States, sports bodies, civil society and the private sector. 52. To enhance national capacities to address terrorist threats at borders, IOM strengthened the border management efforts of the Government of Iraq through the development of infrastructure, the provision of equipment and specialized training to counter Da\u2019esh threats. Related training activities held in early 2025 addressed the examination of documents, interview techniques and the prevention of trafficking in persons at key crossing points. Technical improvements included the deployment of the latest integrated risk education and information system to Baghdad International Airport\u2019s document examination laboratory and the provision of document examination devices to airports in the Kurdistan Region, enhancing capabilities for detecting fraudulent documents. 53. The Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate and the International Institute for Justice and the Rule of Law, with the support of the European Union and the Government of the Republic of Korea, held a regional event in Jakarta on strengthening the oversight and accountability of national security agencies in counter-terrorism, which was focused on the Brussels memorandum on good practices for oversight and accountability mechanisms in counterterrorism of the Global Counterterrorism Forum. The event explored opportunities and challenges in ensuring effective intelligence oversight, particularly in the context of rapidly evolving and emerging technologies. S/2025/496 11/14 25-12039 F. Countering the financing of terrorism 54. During the reporting period, United Nations entities continued to support Member States and Financial Action Task Force-style regional bodies in enhancing efforts to counter the financing of terrorism. The Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate integrated the Counter-Terrorism Committee\u2019s non-binding guiding principles on preventing, detecting and disrupting the use of new and emerging financial technologies for terrorist purposes (the Algeria Guiding Principles) (S/2025/22, annex) into its assessments and dialogue with Member States and is working with the entities of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Coordination Compact and other providers of technical assistance to mainstream the principles into capacity-building and programming efforts. 55. United Nations entities collaborated with the Financial Action Task Force Global Network to enhance Member States\u2019 responses to countering the financing of terrorism. In particular, work on the Comprehensive Update on Terrorist Financing Risks,6 approved by the Financial Action Task Force plenary in June, was co-led by experts from the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate and the French Treasury, with support from the Financial Action Task Force secretariat and inputs from across the Financial Action Task Force Global Network. The Office of Counter- Terrorism, UNODC and the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team also contributed to the project. The report attests to a coordinated approach between the relevant United Nations entities and the Task Force in analysing evolving terrorist financing risks and trends and is aimed at supporting Member States and other relevant stakeholders in understanding, detecting and addressing them. 56.",

In Eastern and Southern Africa, the Office of Counter-Terrorism supported the Eastern and Southern Africa Anti-Money Laundering Group in the integration of human rights considerations into its regional risk assessment processes, including through the identification and mitigation of risks that may affect civil society actors. 57. UNODC continued to support Member States through national and regional workshops, with a particular focus on regional capacity development in countering the financing of terrorism in West Africa. As a result, the Court of First Instance of Abidjan, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, delivered its first-ever verdicts on the financing of terrorism in early 2025, convicting and sentencing six individuals and setting an important legal precedent for the region. G. Impact of information and communications technologies and new technologies on counter-terrorism 58. The United Nations provided support to Member States for strengthening responses to the use of digital and emerging technologies by terrorists by providing capacity-building and technical assistance, including for the development of operational and institutional responses grounded in human rights and the rule of law. Beginning in January, the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Centre, within the Office of Counter-Terrorism, in collaboration with the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL), enhanced the capabilities of approximately 170 officials from nine Member States in the investigation of terrorist activity on the dark web, the use of virtual assets and open-source investigations. 59. The Global Terrorism Threats Facility continued to provide technical assistance to the digital forensic laboratory of the Ministry of Justice of Kyrgyzstan through the __________________ 6 Financial Action Task Force, Comprehensive Update on Terrorist Financing Risks (Paris, 2025). S/2025/496 25-12039 12/14 provision of specialized equipment, complemented by advisory and mentoring services aligned with international good practices. 60. In Iraq, IOM supported the Ministry of Migration and Displacement in developing a Government-owned case management system based on the Organization\u2019s Information, Counselling and Referral Service model, which supports the identification of individual needs and referral to appropriate services. As part of this effort, unified identity cards for returnees were launched at the Amal Rehabilitation Centre to improve case tracking and service delivery for individuals returning from Hawl camp. 61. The Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate integrated the Counter-Terrorism Committee\u2019s non-binding guiding principles on threats posed by the use of unmanned aircraft systems for terrorist purposes (Abu Dhabi Guiding Principles) (S/2023/1035, annex) into its assessments and dialogue with Member States. H. Countering terrorist narratives and engaging with communities to prevent and counter violent extremism conducive to terrorism 62. The United Nations continued to promote inclusive, community-based and context-specific approaches to preventing and countering violent extremism conducive to terrorism, with a focus on youth engagement, digital resilience, local governance, gender-responsive reintegration and multi-stakeholder cooperation. On 17 April, the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Centre organized a side event on online gaming-related risks on the margins of the Economic and Social Council youth forum. Held in partnership with Japan and Singapore, the event facilitated multi-stakeholder dialogue on emerging risks and opportunities in online gaming, with particular attention paid to the impact on children and young people. 63. The Office of Counter-Terrorism, through the United Nations Counter- Terrorism Centre and with substantive support from the Russian Federation, launched a global project aimed at bringing together Member States, regional organizations and United Nations entities to exchange experiences and strengthen responses to radicalization to terrorism and incitement to violence. 64.

In Iraq, IOM supported the implementation of the national countering violent extremism strategy through 13 projects in six districts targeting localized drivers. Training activities on community engagement techniques to build trust between returnees, individuals vulnerable to violent extremism and police forces reached more than 120 civil society members, local authorities and security actors. 65. In Nigeria, UNODC worked directly with young people and communities to prevent recruitment by terrorist groups while supporting the rehabilitation and reintegration of those affected through mentorship and training programmes for selected youth peace champions. State-level policy guidance for operationalizing the Nigeria Call for Action,7 a declaration adopted by the Government of Nigeria that recognizes as a priority the protection of children from recruitment and exploitation by terrorist groups, was developed in partnership with state-level committees for the protection of children in contexts of insecurity. __________________ 7 Available at www.unodc.org/unodc/en/justice-and-prison-reform/strive/newsroom_nigeria-call- for-action_dec-2022.html. S/2025/496 13/14 25-12039 66. Gender-responsive approaches to prevention received enhanced attention through United Nations programmatic initiatives for women. In Tajikistan, the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women), in collaboration with the Government and civil society organizations, launched a localized assessment of gendered drivers of violent extremism conducive to terrorism to inform comprehensive gender-responsive reintegration processes. IV. Observations 67. The threat posed by Da\u2019esh and its affiliates remains undiminished and is marked by adaptability, transnational reach and an expanding operational footprint. While sustained counter-terrorism efforts have constrained the group in the Middle East, its strategic orientation has increasingly shifted towards Africa. Da\u2019esh has consistently demonstrated the ability to regroup and absorb leadership losses and continues to pursue opportunistic expansion into fragile settings, particularly in areas where political instability, weak governance or conflict provide permissive environments. In these contexts, Member States remained concerned about the use of new technologies by terrorist groups. I call on Member States and partners to strengthen coordinated and regionally anchored responses, rooted in international law, including international humanitarian law and international human rights law, and guided by the principle of national ownership, to address both the symptoms of terrorism and the conditions conducive to its spread. 68. While the Pact for the Future reaffirmed the resolve of the international community to pursue a future free from terrorism and address the conditions that give rise to terrorism, resolve must be matched by action. I call upon Member States to deepen regional and international cooperation, strengthen multilateral frameworks and commit to joint strategies that link prevention, protection and accountability. Only through sustained partnership and whole-of-government and whole-of-society approaches, across governments, institutions and communities, can we build the resilience needed to confront evolving threats and promote a peace that is grounded in human rights and the rule of law. 69. I remain gravely concerned about the ongoing humanitarian and security challenges, as well as human rights violations, in camps and detention facilities, particularly in the north-east of the Syrian Arab Republic. The continued confinement of thousands of individuals, especially children, in dire conditions is an affront to human rights and presents serious long-term risks to regional and global security. These settings are potential incubators of radicalization to terrorism and recruitment. I reiterate my call for all Member States with nationals in these facilities to facilitate their safe, voluntary and dignified repatriation, in line with their international legal obligations. As stipulated in Security Council resolution 2427 (2018), children must be treated primarily as victims and granted access to protection and reintegration support.",

Introduction 1. In adopting its resolution 2253 (2015), the Security Council expressed its determination to address the threat posed to international peace and security by Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant1 (ISIL, hereinafter referred to as \u201cDa\u2019esh\u201d)2 and associated individuals and groups and requested that the Secretary-General provide an initial strategic-level report on the threat, followed by updates every four months. In its resolution 2734 (2024), the Council requested that the Secretary-General continue to provide, every six months, strategic-level reports that demonstrate and reflect the gravity of the threat posed by Da\u2019esh to international peace and security and the range of United Nations efforts in support of Member States in countering the threat, particularly that reflect the impact of these efforts. It further requested that the latest biannual report of the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team pursuant to resolutions 1526 (2004) and 2253 (2015) concerning ISIL (Da\u2019esh), Al-Qaida and the Taliban and associated individuals and entities be annexed to the present report. 2. The present report is the twentieth such report.3 It was prepared by the Office of Counter-Terrorism, with the input of the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate and in close collaboration with the Monitoring Team and other United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Coordination Compact entities. 3. During the reporting period, the threat posed to international peace and security by Da\u2019esh remained undiminished. Da\u2019esh continued to maintain a reduced pace of activity in Iraq. In the Syrian Arab Republic, there was a risk of the group exploiting security vacuums after the fall of the Syrian government of Bashar Al-Assad on 8 December. Da\u2019esh and its affiliates continued to increase their focus on activities in Africa, seeking to expand territorial control. Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant- Khorasan (ISIL-K) (QDe.161) continued to pose the predominant terrorist threat in Afghanistan, the region and beyond. The United Nations continued to support __________________ 1 Listed as Al-Qaida in Iraq (QDe.115). 2 In line with General Assembly resolution 75/291. 3 See S/2016/92, S/2016/501, S/2016/830, S/2017/97, S/2017/467, S/2018/80, S/2018/770, S/2019/103, S/2019/612, S/2020/95, S/2020/774, S/2021/98, S/2021/682, S/2022/63, S/2022/576, S/2023/76, S/2023/568, S/2024/117 and S/2024/583.

II. Threat assessment A. Overview and evolution of the threat4 4. Aided by less centralized organizational structures, 5 Da\u2019esh and its affiliates remained resilient and adaptable to counter-terrorism pressure. Propaganda output remained extensive, in multiple languages, often aimed at exploiting conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism in the Middle East and elsewhere to appeal to new recruits and attract additional resources. Da\u2019esh reportedly retained access to significant cash reserves, estimated at approximately $10 million in Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic alone. While some affiliates reportedly had approximately $2 million in reserves, the Da\u2019esh core allegedly directed them to become self-reliant on their own revenue sources. 5. A range of views remained as to the identity of the Da\u2019esh leader, Abu Hafs al-Hashimi al-Qurashi. There was growing confidence among some Member States that al-Qurashi is Abdul Qadir Mumin (Somali) (not listed), the head of the Da\u2019esh affiliate in Somalia. Abdallah Makki Muslih al-Rafi\u2019i (alias Abu Khadija) (not listed) remained in charge of the Ard al-Mubaraka and Bilad al-Rafidayn \u201coffices\u201d, covering Iraq, the Syrian Arab Republic, T\u00fcrkiye and the wider Levant. 6 In Africa, only two \u201coffices\u201d were active: the Da\u2019esh Furqan \u201coffice\u201d, operating in the Lake Chad basin, and the Karrar \u201coffice\u201d in East Africa, which remained a key Da\u2019esh financial hub. The Siddiq \u201coffice\u201d in Afghanistan assumed oversight of the Caucasus, in addition to its previous responsibilities in Asia. 7 Some Member States noted a transfer of functions from the Da\u2019esh \u201cgeneral directorate of provinces\u201d to its \u201cdelegated committee\u201d, responsible for administrative control over the affairs of the group.",

      "text": "\u201coffices\u201d were active: the Da\u2019esh Furqan \u201coffice\u201d, operating in the Lake Chad basin, and the Karrar \u201coffice\u201d in East Africa, which remained a key Da\u2019esh financial hub. The Siddiq \u201coffice\u201d in Afghanistan assumed oversight of the Caucasus, in addition to its previous responsibilities in Asia. 7 Some Member States noted a transfer of functions from the Da\u2019esh \u201cgeneral directorate of provinces\u201d to its \u201cdelegated committee\u201d, responsible for administrative control over the affairs of the group. If confirmed, the transfer of functions and the selection of a leader operating outside Iraq or the Syrian Arab Republic could signify a deliberate pivot towards an even more decentralized operational structure. 6. Following the fall of the Syrian government of Bashar Al-Assad on 8 December, there were concerns that stockpiles of advanced weapons, including unmanned aircraft systems, could be unsecured and at risk of falling into the hands of terrorists. The Syrian Badia region continued to serve as a centre for external operational planning of Da\u2019esh and remained a critical region for its activities. 7. In Iraq, the Government\u2019s counter-terrorism operations resulted in the death of approximately half of the top level leadership of Da\u2019esh in the country. In August, the so-called deputy \u201cgovernor\u201d (wali) of Da\u2019esh in Iraq and 13 other operatives were killed. It remained to be seen if Da\u2019esh in Iraq could replenish its fighters and resources in the face of such pressure. On 27 September, Iraq and the United States of America issued a joint statement announcing that the military mission of the international counter-Da\u2019esh coalition was scheduled to end by September 2025 and __________________ 4 More information on the threat posed to international peace and security by Da\u2019esh and associated individuals, groups, undertakings and entities may be found in the thirty-fifth report of the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team submitted pursuant to resolution 2734 (2024) concerning ISIL (Da\u2019esh), Al-Qaida and associated individuals and entities (S/2025/71). 5 See S/2023/568. 6 See S/2024/117. 7 See S/2022/576. S/2025/72 3/15 25-00800 would transition to bilateral security partnerships for continued support to Iraqi forces. 8. Despite efforts by the Taliban in Afghanistan and regional States, ISIL-K was assessed by Member States to pose the predominant extraregional terrorist threat. The killing of the de facto Minister of Refugees and Repatriation, Khalil Ahmed Haqqani, in a suicide bombing on 11 December 2024, claimed by ISIL-K, marked the highest- profile casualty among the de facto authorities since the Taliban takeover. The attack may represent a deliberate attempt by ISIL-K to undermine the Taliban\u2019s ability to provide security. In addition to attacks in Afghanistan, ISIL-K supporters also plotted attacks in Europe. In July, French security services arrested an 18-year-old individual who was planning to attack an Olympic soccer match in Saint-\u00c9tienne and was connected to a Chechen ISIL member operating in the Syrian Badia. ISIL-K was actively seeking to recruit individuals from Central Asian States. There were reports of small numbers of foreign terrorist fighters continuing to travel to Afghanistan. 9. Da\u2019esh continued its trend of focusing increasingly on various regions in Africa. Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) (QDe.162) remained one of the most operationally active Da\u2019esh affiliates. Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS) (QDe.163) increased attacks and steadily continued to expand the areas under its control. Member State counter-terrorism operations and the activity of Jama\u2019a Nusrat ul-Islam wa al-Muslimin (QDe.159), an Al-Qaida affiliate, in border areas between Burkina Faso, Mali and the Niger led ISGS to expand further eastward. In northwestern Nigeria, members of a group suspected by Member States to be affiliated with ISGS, known locally as \u201cLakurawa\u201d, re-established the group in September. The Lakurawa consisted of over 200 fighters reportedly from Burkina Faso, Mali and the Niger and represented a new ISGS-related threat in the region. 10. In Eastern Africa, approximately half the strength of Da\u2019esh in Somalia reportedly consisted of foreign terrorist fighters from a range of countries. Recruitment campaigns targeted regional and North African States, as well as Yemen. According to reports by Member States, Da\u2019esh in Somalia had refocused its efforts on securing financial sustainability, with revenue allocated to strengthening operational capacity. The operational capabilities of Da\u2019esh in Somalia had reportedly evolved significantly, marked by advancements in weapons and technology. In Central and Southern Africa, Member States assessed that the Allied Democratic Forces (CDe.",

      "text": "Somalia reportedly consisted of foreign terrorist fighters from a range of countries. Recruitment campaigns targeted regional and North African States, as well as Yemen. According to reports by Member States, Da\u2019esh in Somalia had refocused its efforts on securing financial sustainability, with revenue allocated to strengthening operational capacity. The operational capabilities of Da\u2019esh in Somalia had reportedly evolved significantly, marked by advancements in weapons and technology. In Central and Southern Africa, Member States assessed that the Allied Democratic Forces (CDe.001) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo remained resilient despite the gains made through Operation Shujaa conducted by Congolese and Ugandan forces. In Mozambique, Ahl al-Sunna wal-Jama\u2018a (not listed) continued to maintain a presence along the coast of Cabo Delgado. 11. The United Nations continued to verify the severe impact of Da\u2019esh activity in numerous conflict zones, including in parts of Africa. In the Sahel, Da\u2019esh affiliates conducted attacks, including against schools in Burkina Faso, Mali and the Niger, resulting in the killing of children and the denial of humanitarian assistance. These groups continued to expand their operations into coastal countries, especially in Benin and Togo, with a potential impact on Ghana. In Burkina Faso, intensified attacks in September by ISGS, as well as Jama\u2019a Nusrat ul-Islam wa al-Muslimin, contributed to approximately 30 per cent of health facilities closing or reducing their operations to a minimum, depriving approximately 4 million people of access to healthcare. In Mali, the use of unmanned aircraft systems by Da\u2019esh affiliates against civilians resulted in the killing of civilians and internal displacement. 12. Member States continued to note the widespread accessibility of advanced technology, such as the three-dimensional printing of weapon components, including parts for unmanned aircraft systems, and experimentation with artificial intelligence. The use of artificial intelligence by terrorist groups might pose a particular risk in the S/2025/72 25-00800 4/15 recruitment and radicalization of young people to violence, including through more targeted and tailored propaganda. Several Member States noted that the average age of those being radicalized to terrorism appeared to be decreasing. B. Situation of suspected Da\u2019esh members and their family members in conflict zones 13. The United Nations continued to monitor camps, detention and other facilities in the north-east of the Syrian Arab Republic, where individuals with alleged links or family ties to Da\u2019esh were still being held. An estimated 42,500 individuals, including more than 17,700 Iraqi nationals, approximately 16,200 Syrian nationals, and 8,600 foreign nationals remained stranded in the Hawl and Rawj camps and in detention and other facilities, including \u201crehabilitation\u201d centres. The population of these camps, of which 60 per cent are children, decreased only slightly since the previous report, when estimates stood at 44,000 individuals. 14. Individuals held in the camps and other facilities were unable to leave or challenge the lawfulness of their detention or placement. Men and boys in detention facilities were reportedly held (some incommunicado) in overcrowded cells, with insufficient food and healthcare. With few exceptions, humanitarian actors were not permitted contact or engagement with individual children in prisons and in detention and other facilities in the north-east of the Syrian Arab Republic. Member States remained concerned over the fate of these individuals, especially as places of detention became less well secured since the fall of the Syrian government on 8 December. In Iraq, many children have been convicted of terrorist offences and sentenced to a maximum prison term of 15 years. 15. Living conditions at the Hawl and Rawj camps remained dire, and Hawl in particular was severely overcrowded, with limited services and inadequate shelter. Children have not accessed school for many years. Detainees continued to face insecurity and violence, including gender-based violence and sexual exploitation, and there were reports of attacks against humanitarian workers. III. Updates on responses to the evolving threat 16. The United Nations continued to advise and assist Member States in their efforts to counter the threat posed by Da\u2019esh, including to strengthen border security, rehabilitate and reintegrate returnees and provide support for victims of terrorism. New initiatives were focused on regions facing growing instability.",

The United Nations continued to advise and assist Member States in their efforts to counter the threat posed by Da\u2019esh, including to strengthen border security, rehabilitate and reintegrate returnees and provide support for victims of terrorism. New initiatives were focused on regions facing growing instability. In the Sahel, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) launched new projects focused on preventing violent extremism conducive to terrorism and supporting the rehabilitation and reintegration of adults and adolescents. 17. On behalf of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, its Executive Directorate conducted visits to C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Ghana, Mauritania, Turkmenistan and the United Republic of Tanzania to assess the implementation of Security Council resolution 1373 (2001) and subsequent related resolutions. In Africa, these assessments served to address the expanding terrorism threat in the Sahel and its impact on regional stability. The Executive Directorate observed progress in policy and institutional reforms undertaken in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Ghana based on recommendations from the Committee\u2019s previous visits in 2018 and 2019, including on enhancing whole-of- government approaches to counter terrorism and address the conditions conducive to terrorism. S/2025/72 5/15 25-00800 18. On 3 December, the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate hosted a technical meeting to mark the tenth anniversary of Security Council resolution 2178 (2014), raising awareness of the need for comprehensive approaches to counter the threat posed by foreign terrorist fighters. At the meeting, representatives of United Nations entities, Member States, international and regional organizations, civil society and academia emphasized the need for enhanced policy effectiveness, in accordance with international law, and highlighted the impact of international cooperation while identifying implementation gaps to guide future efforts of Member States and United Nations entities. A. Addressing the situation of suspected Da\u2019esh members and their family members in conflict zones 1. Repatriation efforts 19. The pace of repatriations declined significantly during the reporting period, with information that only five Member States had repatriated more than 760 individuals in total from Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic. Among these Member States, the Government of Iraq repatriated approximately 400 Iraqi children from the northeast of the Syrian Arab Republic to a rehabilitation centre in Iraq. 20. UNICEF, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and other United Nations entities continued their work to address barriers to repatriation, including the lack of civil and identification documents. Their work also supported the implementation of programmes to advance community-based reintegration, prevent discrimination and stigmatization and facilitate access to basic social services. IOM provided legal support to more than 1,800 individuals in camps and other facilities and areas of return, in particular the Anbar Governorate in Iraq. 21. In response to needs identified under the Global Framework for United Nations Support on Syrian Arab Republic and Iraq Third Country National Returnees, the European Union-United Nations Global Terrorism Threats Facility, managed by the Office of Counter-Terrorism, continued to support Iraq between July and December through the provision of advisory services, training, and information technology equipment to assist with the registration and screening of adult individuals seeking voluntary repatriation from the Hawl camp. 2. Prosecution and investigation 22. During the reporting period, the United Nations continued to monitor Member State prosecutions for terrorism offences and assisted Member States in developing counter-terrorism legislation. In June, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism expressed concerns regarding counter-terrorism laws in Iraq, highlighting that executions of prisoners, including those accused of terrorism-related offences, were often based on confessions obtained under torture and ambiguous legal provisions. The Special Rapporteur called upon the Government of Iraq to halt executions and ensure fair retrials for individuals on death row, in compliance with international human rights standards. The United Nations observed that Iraq continued to execute prisoners convicted and sentenced under its counter-terrorism laws, recording 10 executions in July and 21 executions, including of one woman, in September. 23.",

The United Nations observed that Iraq continued to execute prisoners convicted and sentenced under its counter-terrorism laws, recording 10 executions in July and 21 executions, including of one woman, in September. 23. The mandate of the United Nations Investigative Team to Promote Accountability for Crimes Committed by Da\u2019esh/Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (UNITAD) ended in September. Throughout its mandate, UNITAD produced 19 case assessments and analytical reports regarding potential crimes against humanity, war S/2025/72 25-00800 6/15 crimes and genocide committed by Da\u2019esh, contributing to the collection and archiving of millions of pieces of information that could be used as evidence in future criminal proceedings. At least 18 cases supported by UNITAD led to indictments, and subsequently 15 convictions. 24. The United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights monitored the trials of six detainees in Iraq, as part of their efforts to promote fair trial rights in criminal and terrorism cases. The detainees, all adult men, are suspected of involvement in Da\u2019esh crimes, of whom three were transferred from detention facilities in the northeast of the Syrian Arab Republic to Iraq. 25. The Office of Counter-Terrorism, in cooperation with the Office of the National Security Adviser of Iraq, provided training to investigators from four Iraqi counter- terrorism entities on human rights-compliant practices, focusing on the prohibition of torture and the lawful use of force. The Office of Counter-Terrorism also shared guidance with the Iraqi High Commission for Human Rights on recent international human rights law developments applicable to counter-terrorism, enabling it to enhance training for security forces. In December 2024, the Office of Counter- Terrorism organized a workshop on integrating international legal standards and good practices in screening and initial assessment processes for government agencies involved in the repatriation of individuals from Hawl camp. 26. In Uganda, the European Union-United Nations Global Terrorism Threats Facility continued to mentor and support the development of a joint national training for the Uganda Police Force and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions to strengthen national coordination in investigating and prosecuting terrorism-related cases. In Malawi, the Facility provided expert advice, together with UNODC and the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate, to the Malawi Law Commission on both substantive offences and criminal procedure relating to terrorism cases, in line with relevant Security Council resolutions, international counter- terrorism conventions, and international human rights, humanitarian and refugee law. The Facility also finalized a study to assist the Law Commission in considering how to strengthen national inter-agency coordination on counter-terrorism, in view of the practices of other African Member States. 3. Rehabilitation and reintegration 27. The United Nations continued to support Member States with the rehabilitation and reintegration of individuals associated with terrorist groups. In Mozambique, UNODC assisted authorities with developing tailored rehabilitation and reintegration programmes in prisons. UNODC organized a high-level visit of representatives of Maldives to the Netherlands and European Union institutions to exchange knowledge and good practices and raise awareness of the latest observed trends and challenges in preventing and countering terrorism, including the repatriation of foreign terrorist fighters and their families. In Malaysia, UNODC supported 30 prison officials in preventing violent extremism conducive to terrorism in prisons through knowledge exchange on international standards, good practices and challenges relating to rehabilitation and reintegration efforts. 28. In Central Asia, the Office of Counter-Terrorism, in cooperation with the United Nations Regional Centre for Preventive Diplomacy for Central Asia and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), convened the first meeting of the working groups of the Central Asia Regional Expert Council on the Rehabilitation and Reintegration of Returnees from Conflict Zones, in July, aimed at strengthening whole-of-society engagement in different thematic areas related to the prosecution, rehabilitation and rein",

In Central Asia, the Office of Counter-Terrorism, in cooperation with the United Nations Regional Centre for Preventive Diplomacy for Central Asia and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), convened the first meeting of the working groups of the Central Asia Regional Expert Council on the Rehabilitation and Reintegration of Returnees from Conflict Zones, in July, aimed at strengthening whole-of-society engagement in different thematic areas related to the prosecution, rehabilitation and reintegration strategies. The Office of Counter- S/2025/72 7/15 25-00800 Terrorism, in coordination with the Regional Centre and OSCE, supported the organization of the second meeting of the Regional Expert Council, in November, focused specifically on civil society-led rehabilitation and reintegration practices among Central Asian States. In December, to address current and emerging trends in regional and international cooperation and identify areas for enhanced technical assistance, the Office of Counter-Terrorism, the Regional Centre and the Government of Uzbekistan held a high-level briefing in New York on the Central Asia Regional Expert Council. 29. In the Lake Chad basin, UNICEF provided support to affected children, including family-based alternative care, reunification, mental health and psychosocial support, as well as to enhance community reintegration. In the Niger, UNICEF provided community-based socioeconomic reintegration services resulting in the opening of government-managed skills training centres to increase economic reintegration options for adolescents. UNICEF continued to support Chad, the Niger and Nigeria in efforts to implement handover protocols to facilitate the quick transfer of children allegedly associated with armed groups from security forces to civilian child protection actors. B. International and regional cooperation 30. Promoting multilateral cooperation, including with international and regional organizations, to prevent and counter terrorism and violent extremism conducive to terrorism remained a priority for the United Nations. The European Union-United Nations Global Terrorism Threats Facility provided capacity-building support to Iraq, Kenya, Kyrgyzstan, Malawi, Tajikistan and Uganda and initiated support to Maldives and Mauritania, at their request and on the basis of technical assistance needs identified by the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate. The support was focused on detecting, preventing, responding to and investigating terrorist threats. 31. At the ministerial meeting of the international counter-Da\u2019esh coalition, held in Washington, D.C., in September, the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate presented United Nations tools to enhance multilateral cooperation in countering Da\u2019esh and its affiliates and encouraged Member States to strengthen United Nations counter-terrorism efforts, particularly in Africa. The Executive Office of the Secretary-General participated in a side event, calling upon Member States to urgently repatriate their citizens from the Hawl and Rawj camps. 32. In November, a high-level conference on strengthening international counter- terrorism cooperation and building agile border security mechanisms was co-organized in Kuwait City by the Governments of Kuwait and Tajikistan and the Office of Counter-Terrorism, as part of the Dushanbe process on countering terrorism and its financing. The conference expanded the Dushanbe process beyond Central Asia to include Member States from the League of Arab States, Africa and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. It also reaffirmed commitments of Member States to implement the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, the Pact for the Future and relevant Security Council resolutions. Through the adoption of the Kuwait Declaration on Border Security and Management, Governments emphasized the importance of multilateral cooperation, the adoption of innovative border security measures and the integration of human rights into counter-terrorism frameworks and agreed on enhanced international and regional coordination to address terrorism. S/2025/72 25-00800 8/15 C. Coordination and coherence across United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Coordination Compact entities 33. The United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Coordination Compact, comprising 46 entities after the end of the mandate of UNITAD, continued to serve to coordinate United Nations efforts to prevent and counter terrorism and violent extremism conducive to terrorism through a One United Nations approach.",

The United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Coordination Compact, comprising 46 entities after the end of the mandate of UNITAD, continued to serve to coordinate United Nations efforts to prevent and counter terrorism and violent extremism conducive to terrorism through a One United Nations approach. The Compact digital platform continued to support coordination, engagement and information exchange among more than 1,050 focal points from 137 Member States, 14 regional organizations and all 46 member and observer entities. D. Supporting the victims of Da\u2019esh 34. Survivor-centred approaches remained central to United Nations efforts to support victims and survivors of violence committed by Da\u2019esh, including sexual and gender-based violence. In August, the United Nations observed the International Day of Remembrance of and Tribute to the Victims of Terrorism. The Office of Counter- Terrorism hosted a high-level event, which underscored the importance of recognizing the role of victims and survivors as advocates and educators, as outlined in General Assembly resolution 72/165. 35. On 8 and 9 October, the Office of Counter-Terrorism, through the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Centre, co-hosted, with the Government of Spain, the International Conference on Victims of Terrorism on the theme \u201cEducation as a tool for prevention, peacebuilding and empowerment of victims of terrorism\u201d. A total of 432 participants from 66 countries, including 59 victims and survivors, 62 civil society members and 42 representatives of international and regional organizations, reviewed progress in amplifying the voices of victims and survivors, fostering collaboration, strengthening networks and ensuring government-led support. 36. In November 2024, the Office of Counter-Terrorism launched the pilot project of the Model Legislative Provisions to Support the Needs and Protect the Rights of Victims of Terrorism in Nigeria. Developed with UNODC and in collaboration with the Government of Nigeria, the project provides technical assistance to protect and support terrorism victims, encouraging Member States to strengthen mechanisms and adopt good practices. 37. Having supported the implementation of the Law on Support to Female Yazidi Survivors in Iraq in 2021, the United Nations continued to work with Iraqi authorities to aid victims, which by October 2024 had resulted in more than 2,000 approved applications for reparation benefits, over 1,000 of which relate to women and girl survivors of sexual or gender-based violence. E. Border management and law enforcement 38. The United Nations initiated several new projects with Member States to improve border management and law enforcement processes to counter terrorism. The European Union-United Nations Global Terrorism Threats Facility and the Office of Counter-Terrorism\u2019s Global Programme on Countering Terrorist Use of Weapons collaborated in Tajikistan to strengthen, through the provision of training and equipment, the capacity of the border troops and the Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Safety and Security Agency to counter the illicit smuggling of nuclear and radiological materials across the Tajikistan-Afghanistan border.

The Office of Counter-Terrorism, through the United Nations Counter- Terrorism Centre, continued to build capacities of Member States to counter the acquisition and use of weapons by terrorists, training more than 160 officials from 19 Member States. In October, the Centre delivered radiation detection equipment and trained 28 personnel from the border security services of Tajikistan on technical and operational aspects of nuclear security. In the same month, the Centre organized a high-level briefing to Member States from Africa and Central Asia to facilitate the implementation of Security Council resolution 2370 (2017) on preventing terrorists from acquiring weapons with a focus on small arms and light weapons, improvised explosive devices and unmanned aircraft systems. Together with UNODC, the Centre provided training in November to officials from Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan on the collection and use of specific evidence in cases related to trafficking in small arms and light weapons and terrorism and provided equipment to increase the capacities of forensic laboratories in these countries to support investigations in this field. During the reporting period, the Centre strengthened the capacities of 50 officials working on counter-terrorism, disarmament and non-proliferation in South Asia, South-east Asia and North Africa to develop their own tabletop exer",

Together with UNODC, the Centre provided training in November to officials from Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan on the collection and use of specific evidence in cases related to trafficking in small arms and light weapons and terrorism and provided equipment to increase the capacities of forensic laboratories in these countries to support investigations in this field. During the reporting period, the Centre strengthened the capacities of 50 officials working on counter-terrorism, disarmament and non-proliferation in South Asia, South-east Asia and North Africa to develop their own tabletop exercises and exercise programmes with the goal of preventing terrorism involving weapons of mass destruction. In December, the Centre trained 25 security officials from Iraq to enhance their capacities to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks involving biological weapons or materials. 40. Following years of engagement and technical assistance from UNODC and OSCE, a new law was adopted in Uzbekistan in August 2024 that facilitates cross- border evidence requests while respecting individual rights. The adoption and implementation of the law was followed by training programmes, including with support from IOM and the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL), as well as technical guidance published by, among others, the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate, the International Association of Prosecutors and UNODC. 41. As part of a project, IOM provided equipment and infrastructure to the Government of Iraq to enhance border management in support of counter-terrorism efforts. IOM deployed mobile border-processing units with Migration Information and Data Analysis System technology to increase security at major crossing points and allow for better monitoring along high-risk borders. These upgrades to communications systems, roads, X-ray devices and document examination laboratories at major airports, combined with capacity-building initiatives for Iraqi officials, have contributed to improved border security in Iraq and helped to combat terrorism, as well as organized crime, smuggling and trafficking. 42. An example of efforts to ensure One United Nations delivery at the nexus between security and development during the reporting period was the Global Programme on Countering Terrorist Threats against Vulnerable Targets, implemented by the Office of Counter-Terrorism, the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate, the United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute (UNICRI) and the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations. The Programme delivered technical assistance to Member States, particularly in West Africa, resulting in national action plans on vulnerable targets protection for Benin, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Mauritania and Senegal. This was complemented by capacity-building activities, supported by resident coordinators and various United Nations entities. The Programme also developed initiatives on safeguarding religious sites, co-led by the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations, and on tourism security, co-led by UNICRI. By strengthening the capacities of Member States to effectively protect vulnerable targets, the Programme contributed to efforts to develop and preserve economic assets S/2025/72 25-00800 10/15 and activities indispensable for sustainable development, addressing in turn some of conditions conducive to terrorism. 43. The Programme produced a technical guide on protecting critical energy infrastructure, which was informed by consultations with the Working Group on Emerging Threats and Critical Infrastructure Protection of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Coordination Compact. The Programme expanded its Global Network of Experts on Vulnerable Targets Protection, engaging Member States, civil society, private sector, academia and United Nations experts through initiatives such as technical briefings on urban security, co-led by the Office of Counter-Terrorism and the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat). 44. The United Nations Countering Terrorist Travel Programme continued to strengthen Member States\u2019 border management and threat detection capabilities. On 19 July, the Programme and Hungary jointly hosted an event in Budapest to celebrate the fifth anniversary and concrete results of this flagship One United Nations capacity-building initiative launched by the Secretary-General in 2019. During the reporting period, in collaboration with partners including the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate, INTERPOL, IOM and UNODC, the Programme provided tailored support to 82 beneficiary countries.",

      "text": "ities. On 19 July, the Programme and Hungary jointly hosted an event in Budapest to celebrate the fifth anniversary and concrete results of this flagship One United Nations capacity-building initiative launched by the Secretary-General in 2019. During the reporting period, in collaboration with partners including the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate, INTERPOL, IOM and UNODC, the Programme provided tailored support to 82 beneficiary countries. Activities included capacity- building to enhance the collection, analysis and use of passenger data in line with international standards and human rights principles. Regional efforts included workshops and study visits for informal working groups in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, West and Central Africa and South-East Asia. 45. In September, the Countering Terrorist Travel Programme held a workshop in Nairobi for East African Member States, which enhanced regional cooperation and coordination on passenger data exchange between Member States and contributed to cross-regional engagement supported by the operationalization of a global informal working group network. At the national level, training activities were held in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Malawi, while passenger information units were established in Botswana, Georgia, Mongolia and Norway. The Programme also focused efforts to enhance awareness and understanding of international standards and recommended practices relating to passenger data privacy and data protection by delivering workshops to participants from Algeria, Georgia, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya and Morocco, in line with international human rights norms and obligations. 46. During the reporting period, the Global Fusion Cells Programme of the Office of Counter-Terrorism continued to deliver training in support of African Member States. Training on ethical questioning, intelligence writing and fusion cell management was conducted for 35 participants from 13 Member States, enhancing skills in elicitation, reporting and fusion centre management with integrated human rights and gender considerations. A three-week train-the-trainer course was conducted in collaboration with United Nations Police, through which 20 officials from eight Member States were certified to deliver counter-terrorism training nationally. In the course, human rights and gender-responsive approaches were emphasized, embedding sustainable expertise within institutions and reinforcing rights-compliant counter- terrorism practices. F. Countering the financing of terrorism 47. The United Nations forged new partnerships to enhance its support for Member States in their efforts to counter the financing of terrorism. In September, the Office of Counter-Terrorism, in collaboration with the Eurasian Group on Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing and the Federal Financial Monitoring Service of the Russian Federation (Rosfinmonitoring), and with the expert contribution of the S/2025/72 11/15 25-00800 Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate, launched a handbook containing practical guidance, based on practices of States members of the Eurasian Group, to support law enforcement agencies in identifying, investigating and confiscating tainted cryptocurrencies used for terrorism financing purposes. 8 The handbook is aimed at providing Member States with access to effective practices and workable solutions while ensuring a more coordinated and harmonized approach to combating the misuse of virtual assets for terrorist financing purposes. 48. During the reporting period, the Office of Counter-Terrorism continued to assist the Eastern and Southern Africa Anti-Money Laundering Group in implementing its regional operational plan for countering terrorism financing, supporting the ongoing terrorism-financing regional risk assessment with the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Somalia and facilitating the Group\u2019s seventh public-private sector dialogue with the participation of the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate. 49. The Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate provided high-level support for the symposium of Beijing Normal University\u2019s College for Criminal Law Science and School of Law on combating the financing of terrorism and facilitating international counter-terrorism cooperation. The symposium served to raise awareness of region-specific challenges in countering terrorism financing and provide law enforcement and policymakers from the region with the latest research. 50. In November, the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate published a report detailing changes in financial flows related to foreign terrorist fighter travel and activities over the 10 years since the adoption of Security Council resolution 2178 (2014).",

In November, the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate published a report detailing changes in financial flows related to foreign terrorist fighter travel and activities over the 10 years since the adoption of Security Council resolution 2178 (2014).9 Expert discussions, hosted to launch the publication, raised awareness of Da\u2019esh\u2019s adaptability, including the decentralization of its financing operations, the growing sophistication of its financing methods, and shifts in related expenditures. The analysis will also inform the work of the Financial Action Task Force on its comprehensive update on global terrorism-financing risks (co-led by the Government of France and the Executive Directorate). 51. In Mozambique, UNODC continued to deliver technical assistance, including on-the-job training to more than 1,100 judicial officials on detecting, prosecuting and adjudicating terrorism and terrorism-financing offences. G. Impact of information and communications technologies and new technologies on counter-terrorism 52. United Nations entities continued to assist Member States in countering the threat posed by terrorist use of new and emerging technologies while identifying ways to harness technological advancements to counter terrorism through a human rights- based approach. The European Union-United Nations Global Terrorism Threats Facility provided technical advice and facilitated a study visit for the Ministry of Justice of Kyrgyzstan to enhance digital forensic capabilities for counter-terrorism cases while ensuring compliance with the rule of law and international human rights standards. In Kenya, the Facility supported the National Counter-Terrorism Centre in __________________ 8 Available at www.un.org/counterterrorism/sites/www.un.org.counterterrorism/files/uncct_cft_ va_report_2024_en.pdf. 9 Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate, \u201cTrends tracker \u2013 evolving trends in the financing of foreign terrorist fighters\u2019 activity: 2014 \u2013 2024\u201d, November 2024, available at www.un.org/securitycouncil/ctc/sites/www.un.org.securitycouncil.ctc/files/cted_trends_tracker_ evolving_trends_in_the_financing_of_foreign_terrorist_fighters_activity_2014_-_2024.pdf. S/2025/72 25-00800 12/15 enhancing its capacities to monitor and analyse open-source information in support of its counter-terrorism efforts. 53. In November 2024, the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Centre within the Office of Counter-Terrorism, through its Global Counter-Terrorism Programme on Cybersecurity and New Technologies, launched the CT TECH+ initiative in collaboration with INTERPOL and with the support of the European Union. The initiative is aimed at providing tailored support to requesting Member States in improving their response to the increased misuse of new technologies for terrorist purposes while protecting human rights and promoting gender-responsive approaches to addressing the exploitation and manipulation by terrorists of gender inequalities and norms. 54. During the reporting period, the Office of Counter-Terrorism, through its Global Counter-Terrorism Programme on Autonomous and Remotely Operated Systems, built the capacity of more than 100 officials from Malaysia and Senegal on unmanned aircraft system threats and on the safe, secure and non-lethal use of such systems for counter-terrorism purposes, including through an awareness-raising conference, three unmanned aircraft system operator courses and two unmanned aircraft system operator training-of-trainers courses. The support to Senegal included the first in-depth national consultations on such systems conducted by the Programme in collaboration with the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate to assist in the development of a national road map to counter the threat posed by the use of unmanned aircraft systems by terrorists. H. Countering terrorist narratives and engaging with communities to prevent and counter violent extremism conducive to terrorism 55. The United Nations continued to provide Member States with a range of capacity-building initiatives and technical assistance to prevent and counter violent extremism conducive to terrorism and to support their engagement with various stakeholders, in line with whole-of-government and whole-of-society approaches, including in the development of counter-terrorist narratives.",

The United Nations continued to provide Member States with a range of capacity-building initiatives and technical assistance to prevent and counter violent extremism conducive to terrorism and to support their engagement with various stakeholders, in line with whole-of-government and whole-of-society approaches, including in the development of counter-terrorist narratives. To address an increase in terrorist recruitment in the Sahel, UNODC launched a regional youth-focused network for the prevention of violent extremism conducive to terrorism. Building on lessons learned from delivering similar initiatives in Central Asia, South Asia and South-East Asia, the network brings together government and civil society to share good practices. 56. IOM continued its support to the Government of Iraq for the implementation of its national countering violent extremism strategy. During the reporting period, IOM trained service providers in rehabilitation facilities, families in areas of return and local leaders with specialized knowledge on engagement with individuals affected by violent extremism. Moreover, IOM developed a peace education programme to promote social cohesion and counter violent extremist narratives, reaching more than 5,000 boys and girls and 300 teachers in the Governorates of Ninawa, Kirkuk and Salah al-Din in 2024. 57. The United Nations Development Programme partnered with the Government of Iraq to strengthen local capacities for preventing violent extremism conducive to terrorism in seven governorates. The project included developing and implementing plans of action, which are aimed at localizing national strategies to prevent violent extremism conducive to terrorism. In July, the Programme provided training to local civil society organizations on preventing violent extremism conducive to terrorism in a human rights-based manner. This initiative empowered local non-governmental S/2025/72 13/15 25-00800 organizations to contribute to the prevention of violent extremism conducive to terrorism at the community level. 58. The Office of Counter-Terrorism\u2019s Global Programme on Preventing and Countering Violent Extremism, together with the European Union-United Nations Global Terrorism Threats Facility, finalized support to the National Counter- Terrorism Centre of Kenya in developing a national approach to strategic communication and a monitoring and evaluation framework for the implementation of the Government\u2019s National Strategy to Counter Violent Extremism. 59. In November, the Office of Counter-Terrorism\u2019s Programme Office on Parliamentary Engagement in Preventing and Countering Terrorism organized the Doha Youth Parliamentary Forum on the theme \u201cPromoting youth perspectives in parliamentary responses to terrorism and violent extremism\u201d. The Forum complemented the Office of Counter-Terrorism\u2019s broader efforts on youth engagement and is aimed at integrating youth perspectives into parliamentary discussions on counter-terrorism and preventing violent extremism conducive to terrorism. 60. The Office of Counter-Terrorism\u2019s Global Programme on Preventing and Countering Violent Extremism continued to focus on empowering young leaders to counter the influence of Da\u2019esh-affiliated terrorist groups in Africa through the Youth Engagement and Empowerment Programme, which began in Nigeria in August 2023. Activities under this initiative directly shaped the policy recommendations put forward at the regional dialogue held in August 2024, at which young leaders from Kenya, Nigeria and Somalia shared their proposals with regional stakeholders, advancing collaboration and youth-informed policy frameworks. IV. Observations 61. The severity of the threat posed by Da\u2019esh remains concerning. Despite steady progress by Member States and international partners in targeting Da\u2019esh leadership and financial operations, the group continues to demonstrate resilience and adapt its modus operandi. While Da\u2019esh maintains a reduced pace of activity in Iraq, there is a risk of the group exploiting the volatile situation in the Syrian Arab Republic to strengthen its position. To mitigate such a risk, the political transition ahead \u2013 guided by the principles of Security Council resolution 2254 (2015) and managed by the Syrians themselves, with the support of the United Nations and the international community \u2013 requires carefully integrating comprehensive counter-terrorism approaches that promote and protect international law, including international humanitarian law and international human rights law, and respect for human rights for all and the rule of law, as emphasized in the Pact for the Future.",

To mitigate such a risk, the political transition ahead \u2013 guided by the principles of Security Council resolution 2254 (2015) and managed by the Syrians themselves, with the support of the United Nations and the international community \u2013 requires carefully integrating comprehensive counter-terrorism approaches that promote and protect international law, including international humanitarian law and international human rights law, and respect for human rights for all and the rule of law, as emphasized in the Pact for the Future. In this regard, to overcome the long-term impact of terrorism, any political transition must seek access to justice, truth and reparation and ensure due support to victims of terrorism. 62. I am alarmed by the ongoing insecurity and violence and human rights violations affecting the thousands of individuals, mostly women and children, who remain stranded in prisons, camps and other facilities in the north-east of the Syrian Arab Republic. I remain deeply concerned about the dire situation faced by these individuals, including unaccompanied or orphaned children, which may be exacerbated by the prevailing volatility in the country. As stipulated in Security Council resolution 2427 (2018), children should be treated primarily as victims. I urge Member States to comply with applicable obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child and encourage access for civilian child protection actors to children deprived of liberty for association with armed groups. I call upon all relevant authorities to continue to make every necessary effort to protect civilians and ensure S/2025/72 25-00800 14/15 security and access to humanitarian services for those individuals, in particular in the Hawl and Rawj camps. Recent successful repatriations and subsequent prosecutions show that States have the capacity to ensure that their nationals are treated with dignity and afforded due process and a fair trial or rehabilitation, thereby promoting accountability. Facilitating safe, voluntary and dignified repatriations should remain a priority. I reiterate my repeated calls upon, and my commitment to supporting Member States with nationals in these facilities to significantly boost their efforts to facilitate the safe, voluntary and dignified repatriation of all those individuals to their countries of nationality or origin, in line with Member States\u2019 respective obligations under international law. 63. The situation in Afghanistan remains concerning, with ISIL-K continuing to represent a threat not only to the country but also to the region and beyond. I continue to call upon all Member States to unite to prevent Afghanistan from again becoming a hotbed of terrorist activities affecting other countries. 64. I am gravely concerned about the sustained terrorist threat in parts of Africa. Da\u2019esh continues to focus its activities on the continent, and its affiliates remain intent on expanding their control over territory and populations while leveraging opportunities to raise funds. The increasing terrorist activity across different regions continues to pose not only a significant threat to international peace and security but also enormous challenges for sustainable development and the protection of human rights. I call upon Member States to enhance their efforts to comprehensively address the drivers and consequences of terrorism in parts of Africa, including through whole- of-government and whole-of-society approaches. 65. The sustained high level of the threat posed by Da\u2019esh, despite significant counter-terrorism efforts in the past several years, is a constant reminder of the limits of security-centred approaches against terrorism. While these measures, when fully compliant with international law and human rights standards, are necessary, they must be accompanied by comprehensive approaches that not only counter the threat but also prevent it from emerging or reemerging. Prevention remains the best course of action to protect people sustainably from the scourge of terrorism and violent extremism conducive to terrorism. I therefore continue to encourage Member States to consider developing and adequately investing in regional and national prevention strategies, grounded in sustainable development and the creation of opportunities and livelihoods in line with the mandate to leave no one behind, that are aimed at addressing terrorism and other forms of violence, centred on the rule of law and human rights and based on whole-of-government and whole-of-society approaches. 66.",

As terrorism continues to pose a global threat, I welcome the adoption of the Pact for the Future, in particular the commitment by Member States to pursue a future free from terrorism and to redouble their efforts to address the conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism, prevent and combat terrorism, address the threats posed by the misuse of new and emerging technologies, build States\u2019 capacity to prevent and combat terrorism, and strengthen the coordination role of the United Nations system. In line with their primary responsibility to counter terrorism, I urge Member States to transform those commitments into action. 67. The United Nations, including through its Global Counter-Terrorism Coordination Compact, will continue to support Member States in their efforts to prevent and counter terrorism and violent extremism conducive to terrorism, including in implementing the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and relevant Security Council resolutions, within the framework of international law.

Fondation des \u0153uvres pour la solidarit\u00e9 et le bien-\u00eatre social, ONG (FOSBES) Special, 2012 Introduction The Fondation des \u0153uvres pour la solidarit\u00e9 et le bien-\u00eatre social (FOSBES) is a non-governmental organization that was established by Gilbert Kalubi on 15 February 2000 with the aim of promoting, through acts of solidarity, the social well-being of people in general and the advancement of society in particular. The company is therefore committed to promoting development, protecting the environment and improving the living conditions of the Congolese people, while also participating in various programmes of both the African Union (the Abuja strategic social framework of 2008) and the United Nations. This report provides comprehensive information on all the social, environmental and development activities of FOSBES. E/C.2/2025/2/Add.5 5/14 25-05414 Aims and purposes of the organization FOSBES has a number of objectives but is currently focusing predominantly on: Promoting comprehensive community development; Enabling communities to live in lasting peace and bringing citizens closer to Governments; Significantly reducing urban delinquency and crime; Providing balanced access for people to an accessible environment; Providing people with access to justice to support family cohesion and dignity. Significant changes in the organization As can be seen, the scope of our work is well defined, but we have limited resources. We have reached over 5,200,000 people, or 5.7 per cent of a possible 90,000,000, through our activities, particularly in the areas of information-sharing, training and awareness-raising about community work. We have continued, in collaboration with non-governmental organizations, to provide access for the informal sector to disease risk-sharing under the universal health coverage programme in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In addition, we have continued the flagship activities under the campaign to change attitudes among young people in the light of the rise of \u201ckulunas\u201d, namely, young people who use machetes or blunt instruments to brutally attack people and make money. Contribution of the organization to the work of the United Nations Although material hardships have forced us to reduce our efforts to contribute to the work of the United Nations, the situation may improve in the near future thanks to new initiatives to implement three Sustainable Development Goals. FOSBES continues to educate and raise awareness among the Congolese people and to encourage their participation in the activities of Global Compact Local Networks through sustainable partnership projects, and in efforts to combat poverty and ensure the effective involvement of women in development initiatives. Participation in meetings of the United Nations FOSBES has participated in local activities carried out by organizations in the United Nations system but has found it increasingly difficult to participate in international activities, as follows: \u2013 2020 was a very difficult year marked by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic \u2013 Sixty-fifth session of the Commission on the Status of Women, held from 15 to 26 March 2021 \u2013 Fifty-fifth session of the Commission on Population and Development, held from 25 to 29 April 2022 in New York \u2013 2022 United Nations Conference to Support the Implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development, held from 27 June to 1 July 2022 in New York E/C.2/2025/2/Add.5 25-05414 6/14 \u2013 United Nations Conference on the Midterm Comprehensive Review of the Implementation of the Objectives of the International Decade for Action, \u201cWater for Sustainable Development\u201d, 2018\u20132028, held from 22 to 24 March 2023 in New York \u2013 High-level political forum on sustainable development held from 10 to 20 July 2023 in New York \u2013 Regular session of the Human Rights Council \u2013 Attended several human rights conferences Cooperation with United Nations bodies A number of difficulties have arisen with regard to the administrative facilities that accredited non-governmental organizations are required to have with local United Nations agencies, in particular the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for the Democratic Republic of the Congo in Kinshasa. In addition to those difficulties, the diplomatic mission of the United States of America does not seem to understand that the relationship between non-governmental organizations and the United Nations is about ensuring that the work of the United Nations is always visible.",

Solidarit\u00e9 agissante pour le d\u00e9veloppement familial (SADF) Special, 2012 Introduction Although we achieved truly great success during these years, we also experienced sadness during the historic period of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. E/C.2/2025/2/Add.5 25-05414 12/14 Aims and purposes of the organization Solidarit\u00e9 agissante pour le d\u00e9veloppement familial (SADF) works to reduce poverty and hunger. We are committed to promoting socioeconomic activities that can help to alleviate the pain and misery of various types of poor families. We act on their behalf and protect their rights by creating human rights institutions to combat violence against women and young people and ensure that they do not become perpetual victims. We organize vocational training workshops in various trades (relating to good governance and the United Nations system) to help our beneficiaries to take charge of their lives. Significant changes in the organization Faced with the global disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we decided to create new virtual offices to implement organizational changes and help to remedy the lack of information for our members and national, provincial and regional communities, even those in places without Internet. This change has helped us in everything from innovation, member engagement and better performance to direct communication and favourable responses. To successfully lead such a change, we turned to an interim manager as an essential strategic solution. Teleworking and flexible office arrangements have been implemented. The Executive Secretary of SADF was replaced by the Deputy Executive Secretary. Contribution of the organization to the work of the United Nations Our contribution consists of investing in people through specific actions, such as promoting higher living standards, full employment and conditions conducive to the economic and social progress and development of communities.",

Contribution of the organization to the work of the United Nations Our contribution consists of investing in people through specific actions, such as promoting higher living standards, full employment and conditions conducive to the economic and social progress and development of communities. We worked in collaboration with everyone without discrimination or tribalism to support the achievement without fail of the Millennium Development Goals in the areas of education, hunger, women\u2019s empowerment, gender equality, environment and health. The search for peace and security by the people and the leaders of our countries has been at the forefront of our actions in the countries where we are based, namely, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Cameroon, and in the countries where our members and partners live. We have contributed to and led lobbying efforts to encourage the authorities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to maintain good relations with neighbouring countries and protect the people. On several occasions, we had to work remotely with the Congolese Government and other African countries. SADF is committed to training and educating people living in poverty to enable them to take care of themselves, thus reducing unemployment and severe malnutrition. This is what is driving our country towards development and peace, in support of the peacekeeping mission of the United Nations. Participation in meetings of the United Nations SADF has participated by videoconference and in person, including in a consultation organized by the Economic and Social Council; in the sixty-fourth, sixty- fifth, sixty-sixth and sixty-seventh sessions of the Commission on the Status of Women, remotely and in person; and in a consultation involving United Nations observers of the least developed countries in Africa, Asia-Pacific and Latin America. SADF participated in the General Assembly in 2023; participated in and organized the side event at the United Nations Conference to Support the Implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development, held in Portugal in 2022; participated remotely in the twenty-second and twenty-seventh sessions of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, in 2021 and E/C.2/2025/2/Add.5 13/14 25-05414 2022; participated in the Fifth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, held in Doha; and organized two side events and other meetings that cannot be listed because there is not enough space. Cooperation with United Nations bodies We have enjoyed good cooperation with the United Nations Non-Governmental Liaison Service and have appreciated the support to our organization from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and, of course, the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We are committed to collaborating and strengthening our relations not only with them but also with the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund, and we often participate in civil society consultations launched by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Initiatives taken by the organization in support of the Sustainable Development Goals Promotion of income-generating activities, advocacy, teleworking, mobilization of financial resources and networking, all while working with others to learn and share good practices (through youth clubs and dialogues with minorities and marginalized people). 8.

Aims and purposes of the organization Combating recklessness, laziness and illiteracy among young people through education and vocational training; promoting and spreading Congolese culture through print and audiovisual media; protecting and addressing (denouncing violations of) the rights of children and young people; combating harmful behaviour (drug and alcohol use, rape, corruption and favouritism); fostering peace and development through our actions; reducing poverty in rural areas by engaging the population in sustainable development; encouraging environmental protection and public participation by providing reliable information and facilitating access to education, food security and primary healthcare for all; supporting efforts to combat HIV/AIDS and all endemic diseases; supporting efforts to combat global warming and deforestation; combating corruption, drug abuse and all forms of violence against women and girls; and training, informing and educating people about new information technologies. E/C.2/2025/2/Add.5 25-05414 14/14 Significant changes in the organization Two senior members of the organization were designated as focal points for the National Centre for Climate Change Research and for the European Union delegation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to monitor projects. There have been deaths among our members. Local branches were opened in Bilili and Nkutu in Kwilu Province to monitor our activities. Two partnerships were signed with two foundations. Contribution of the organization to the work of the United Nations In collaboration with the National Centre for Climate Change Research of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the organization has run several local workshops and training courses for young people following the implementation of our projects in the country. With the European Union delegation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, TOI has organized several meetings, workshops, seminars and training courses on pollutants, deforestation and environmental management in Kwilu Province and on the consequences of global warming. Participation in meetings of the United Nations Since TOI refused to engage in certain aspects of political life in keeping with the demands of the public, its senior staff and members, including the person responsible for communications, have been banned from leaving the country by the current authorities. Since February 2024, the situation seems to have been normalizing and improving. We hope to resume our normal activities. Cooperation with United Nations bodies TOI has always maintained good relations with the institutions of the United Nations system despite the difficulties we have encountered from the authorities in place since 2019, whose law enforcement officials have vandalized our equipment, vehicles and digital tools. Currently, our main concern is to strengthen the capacity of our members following a period of inactivity. Initiatives taken by the organization in support of the Sustainable Development Goals TOI has designed and submitted to the European Union delegation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo five social projects for 2024 to benefit the Indigenous population. TOI has helped to promote the production of seasonal field crops of maize, cassava, squash and peanuts in Nkutu I and II villages in Kwilu Province, with a view to gradually reducing poverty. The National Centre for Climate Change Research has agreed to fund workshops and training for local leaders on the management of our projects. Meeting organizers should contact the various consular services at Schengen House to facilitate visits by delegations, especially for important meetings held in Geneva. We call for United Nations meetings to also be held in countries in post-conflict or conflict situations, so that the environmental and humanitarian needs of those nations can be addressed with the help of United Nations experts.",

Association marocaine des droits humains Special, 2007 Introduction Association marocaine des droits humains (AMDH) is a non-governmental organization recognized as operating in the public interest, established on 24 June 1979. In 2018, AMDH had more than 11,000 members. It has 92 local offices throughout Morocco, which are grouped into 10 regional branches. The activities of AMDH are focused on four basic categories: women, youth, workers and intellectual democrats. Aims and purposes of the organization The aims and purposes of the organization are as follows. AMDH works to preserve human dignity and ensure the respect, protection and promotion of all human rights in all their dimensions. Its aims include: \u2013 Raising awareness of human rights issues and providing human rights education, with a particular focus on women, young people, children and workers. \u2013 Ensuring that Morocco ratifies, without reservation, all international covenants on human rights, that those rights are incorporated into Moroccan law, that Moroccan law is compliant with the covenants, and that the covenants are respected. \u2013 Identifying, denouncing and condemning all human rights violations and working towards their cessation. \u2013 Offering solidarity and support to victims of violations. Significant changes in the organization \u2013 Twelfth national congress held on 26, 27 and 28 April 2019 under the theme \u201cUnified efforts to implement the National Charter of Human Rights and protect all rights and freedoms\u201d. \u2013 Thirteenth national congress held on 24, 25 and 26 April 2022 under the theme \u201cUnited in protecting the right to defend human rights for freedom, dignity, equality and social justice\u201d. As usual, the congress was an opportunity for AMDH: \u2013 To enable representatives of its local offices and regional branches to assess the human rights situation and evaluate the results of the past period. \u2013 To establish a work strategy for the coming period. \u2013 To renew its governing bodies by holding elections for the Administrative Committee and the Central Office. E/C.2/2025/2/Add.8 25-06287 6/11 \u2013 Among the most important recommendations emphasized by participants was the need to attach importance to economic, social, cultural and environmental rights. The preparations for these two congresses were made in almost identical national contexts, characterized by a strong State crackdown on human rights and the democratic movement in Morocco. AMDH was specifically targeted in this attack, with a view to curtailing its work and its influence on the protection and promotion of human rights. It has been subject to a number of prohibitions; for example, it was prohibited from organizing activities in public halls, and its applications for the renewal of, or the issuance of certificates for, its branches have been rejected by the authorities. The most recent obstacles faced by AMDH were the refusal to make public halls available for the opening ceremony of its congress and the delay in confirming the reservation of the international youth complex in Bouznika. This crackdown has continued to grow, affecting almost all branches throughout the country. The number of branches that have been deprived of their right to obtain a certificate for the renewal of their bodies, in breach of current laws and international conventions on freedom of expression and association, has now reached 83. Contribution of the organization to the work of the United Nations \u2013 Publish annual reports on the situation of economic, social and cultural rights in Morocco. \u2013 Implement programmes to promote and raise awareness of economic, social and cultural rights. \u2013 Participate in round tables on the situation of economic, social and cultural rights in countries on the southern shores of the Mediterranean and in the Middle East and North Africa region.",

Association pour la d\u00e9fense des droits de la femme mauritanienne Special, 2019 Introduction The Association pour la d\u00e9fense des droits de la femme mauritanienne (ADDFM) is a non-profit association that was founded and registered in 2000. The Association currently has 60 active members and 20 volunteers (men and women), who are committed to achieving our long-term goals. ADDFM works for the promotion and protection of human rights, with a focus on protecting women from all forms of violence, protecting children, providing care for victims of gender-based violence, protecting persons with disabilities, raising awareness of human rights, advocating for legal protection for women, providing training and employment support, promoting prisoners\u2019 rights and carrying out other educational activities. In 2019, ADDFM was granted special consultative status with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations. In this report, we describe the situation of women, children and persons with disabilities and recommend several measures to improve the human rights situation in Mauritania. \u2013 Prisoners\u2019 rights: The ADDFM team, led by its president, organized visits to the various prisons in Nouakchott to assess the situation of prisoners and to distribute food and health kits. Aims and purposes of the organization In 2022, thanks to technical and financial support from Germany and the European Union, ADDFM, in collaboration with administrative and local authorities in Nouakchott, organized several campaigns to raise awareness of women\u2019s rights, female genital mutilation and the rights of persons with disabilities. Religious leaders and community representatives have received training on human rights issues and have carried out awareness-raising activities in three wilayahs of Nouakchott. In 2022, ADDFM provided care for 290 children, comprising 155 girls and 135 boys. Those children had faced numerous violations of their rights, including with regard to their civil status (undocumented children), access to free healthcare and right to schooling, and the girls had faced violations of their physical integrity (cutting). More than 60 per cent of those children were street children. Significant changes in the organization There have been no significant changes during the reporting period. Contribution of the organization to the work of the United Nations \u2013 Contributed to the work of the United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute. \u2013 Workshop on integrating gender perspectives into the prevention of violent extremism, May 2024. Participation in meetings of the United Nations United Nations Development Programme meeting on women\u2019s empowerment and gender equality in Dakar. E/C.2/2025/2/Add.8 25-06287 8/11 Humanitarian conference in Istanbul. Human rights conference in New York. Cooperation with United Nations bodies Tripartite cooperation with the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) in Mauritania to support the protection of children.

Initiatives taken by the organization in support of the Sustainable Development Goals \u2013 Protection of children: Children are one of the Association\u2019s priorities. It is true that Mauritania has a legal framework for protecting children from all forms of abuse. In reality, however, children are the primary victims of violations of their fundamental rights, including their rights to education, health, work and leisure. \u2013 Female genital mutilation and domestic violence: In Mauritania, the most obvious problems are those related to the following forms of violence: (i) female genital mutilation/cutting, with a prevalence of 66.6 per cent (Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 2015); (ii) marriage of children under 18 years of age, with a prevalence of 35.2 per cent (Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 2015); (iii) early pregnancy, with a prevalence of 21.5 per cent (Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 2015); and domestic sexual violence, with a prevalence of 17.3 per cent in urban areas, and psychological violence, with a prevalence of over 60 per cent (national statistical office, 2011). \u2013 Training and employment: In Mauritania, many young boys and girls drop out of school at an early age due to family poverty and other structural factors. ADDFM seeks to support the most motivated among them by providing guidance and assistance in training and employment. \u2013 Gender-based violence awareness-raising sessions in schools: ADDFM organized awareness-raising sessions on female genital mutilation and other forms of gender-based violence in several schools in the communes of Sebkha and El Mina. 5. Dynamique des groupes des peuples autochtones (DGPA) Special, 2015 Introduction Dynamique des groupes des peuples autochtones (DGPA) is a national platform that brings together Indigenous Pygmy organizations and organizations that support Indigenous Pygmy Peoples across the country. The platform currently comprises more than 45 member organizations spread across 21 provinces where Indigenous Pygmies live. It is registered under F-92 12440 in accordance with Decree-Law No. 004/2001 of 20 July 2001 on general provisions applicable to non-profit associations and public utility services in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and is recognized as a legal person in accordance with Ministerial Order No. 501/CAB/MIN/J&DH/2011. E/C.2/2025/2/Add.8 9/11 25-06287 Aims and purposes of the organization Goal of DGPA: A country in which Pygmies fully enjoy their fundamental rights and their human dignity is restored. Objectives: By 2035, facilitate the active participation of the Indigenous Pygmy Peoples of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the governance of their territories and the sustainable management of forests, and enable them to secure their ancestral lands and enjoy the benefits of the natural resources therein, by encouraging decision makers to consider their rights, interests and customs with a view to improving the living conditions of present and future generations. Significant changes in the organization The significant changes were as follows: 1. DGPA decided to replace a member of the Board of Directors. 2. It also decided to replace a member of the Audit Committee. 3. The platform\u2019s staff were bolstered with a Director of Programmes and a Director of Administration and Finance. 4. DGPA adopted a gender policy and an environmental and social protection policy. 5. In recent years, the platform has contributed to the protection of the rights of Indigenous Pygmy Peoples by encouraging the promulgation by the Head of State of a specific Act dedicated to those peoples and by securing more than 300,000 ha to date of their ancestral lands. Contribution of the organization to the work of the United Nations As previously noted, the important work towards the adoption and promulgation of the Act on Indigenous Pygmies in the Democratic Republic of the Congo enjoyed, from the outset, the technical, material and financial support of United Nations agencies such as the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the United Nations Democracy Fund (UNDEF), the World Food Programme (WFP) and the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.",

This support helped us a great deal in raising awareness among our leaders and political actors about not only the cause of the Indigenous Pygmies but also the need to adopt specific laws in accordance with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, ratified by the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2007. Today, following the promulgation by the Head of State of Act No. 22/030 of 15 July 2022 on the protection and promotion of the rights of Indigenous Pygmy Peoples in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, we are working with the same agencies (UNEP, UNDP, FAO, UNESCO, UNDEF, WFP and the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office in the Democratic Republic of the Congo) to follow up on, monitor and raise awareness of the Act and, above all, to develop implementing measures to facilitate its effective implementation. E/C.2/2025/2/Add.8 25-06287 10/11 Participation in meetings of the United Nations We have recently participated in a number of United Nations meetings with the aim of raising awareness of the rights of Indigenous Pygmy Peoples in all the work of the United Nations and its agencies. We have participated in major conferences that have emerged from various sessions of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, including those held in Madrid, Glasgow and Dubai. We have also participated in various meetings of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, including the meeting held in Montreal, Canada, and will participate in the meeting soon to be held in Cali. In addition, we have participated in a number of climate-related side events, including various events during Climate Week in New York and the Tropical Forest Forum in Oslo. These events enable us to promote certain causes nationally, regionally and internationally and to raise awareness of the rights of Indigenous Peoples and their invaluable contribution to preserving the tropical forests of the Congo basin, as well as their contribution to protecting biodiversity. Cooperation with United Nations bodies We have engaged in good cooperation based on respect for free, prior and informed consent and have received technical, material and financial support for our work, including activities to mark the International Day of Indigenous Peoples. Initiatives taken by the organization in support of the Sustainable Development Goals DGPA initiatives are cross-cutting, combining efforts to protect community rights, secure ancestral lands, improve living conditions, support health and strengthen the economic power of households, all while promoting resilience in the face of climate change. 6.

They continued to advocate the effective implementation of Assembly resolution 63/237 on sickle-cell anaemia. Cooperation with United Nations bodies The organization has strengthened its ties with United Nations agencies based in the Congo. The highlight of 2019 was the designation of the organization\u2019s President, Antoinette Sassou N\u2019Guesso, as a global health leader by the World Health Organization at the World Health Assembly in Geneva. In the same year, the President was appointed Head of the Organization of African First Ladies for Development.

Union internationale des huissiers de justice et officiers judiciaires Special, 1996 Introduction The Union internationale des huissiers de justice et officiers judiciaires was created in 1952. In 2024, it included members of organizations representing judicial officers, enforcement officers and similar personnel from 98 countries across the American, African, Asian and European continents. Aims and purposes of the organization The Union seeks to represent its members before international organizations and to support collaboration with national professional bodies and the implementation of international treaties. It strives to promote ideas, projects and initiatives that are designed to elevate and advance the independent status of judicial officers. Moreover, the Union contributes to efforts to structure the profession, including through the creation and development of national professional organizations with a view to their eventual membership of the Union. It participates in expert missions with Governments and international organizations. Lastly, it promotes wherever possible the establishment of a body of judicial officers who are senior legal professionals fulfilling the dual function of serving judicial and extrajudicial documents and enforcing court rulings. Significant changes in the organization There have been no changes. E/C.2/2025/2/Add.7 25-05862 4/12 Contribution of the organization to the work of the United Nations Having established the World Day of the Judicial Officer in 2008, the Union now hopes to establish, in collaboration with the other judicial professions, the World Day of Judicial Professions.

Contribution of the organization to the work of the United Nations See the initiatives taken in support of the Sustainable Development Goals below. Participation in meetings of the United Nations No participation was specified. Cooperation with United Nations bodies No cooperation was specified. Initiatives taken by the organization in support of the Sustainable Development Goals The universalization of the United Nations architecture requires a foundation that we believe could be based on two points. The first is an emphasis on the primordial script, which dates back more than 50,000 years. It first appeared on the island of Borneo before spreading to every continent on the planet (see cave and rock art). Extensive research has shown this to be a kind of proto-script with three characteristics: steganography (concealment); true semasiography (narrative conveyed through symbols); and pasigraphy (a writing system that, once deciphered, can be understood by any human being on the planet). This script is therefore steganographic, semasiographic and pasigraphic, which makes it universal. In addition, a second area of research has shown that, for at least 51,000 years, humankind has built its values and psyche around a creation myth explaining its origins, its reason for being and where it is heading. This work, which has been carried out voluntarily over several thousand hours, could lead the United Nations to justify its existence and purpose in the depths of time, tracing back to the emergence of the human species. With a view to enabling the United Nations to make a conceptual breakthrough that would justify a whole series of political decisions, we are finalizing an international flagship publication that outlines the current state of affairs and, through a renewal of human anthropology as we know it, will energize and support the growth of our great universal institution. We are convinced that the dissemination of this document, once it has been published in the two most renowned scientific journals, Science and Nature, will lay a substantial foundation for humanity and its representative organization, the United Nations. Our work is already recognized by the National Centre for Scientific Research (see letter from Professor Braga and the mission to South Africa), a leading European scientific body, and by the Ministry of Research, Innovation, Higher Education and National Education of France, which has provided a research tax credit. This recognition from various institutions will be complemented by knowledge. We believe that this second step, which we are working hard to achieve through a publication, will attract donor funding for our international non-governmental organization and thus enable us to register with your body at the various levels at which you allow us to participate. Although we have received some recognition, awareness of our organization is currently lacking. These discoveries will provide leading United Nations decision makers with rich, fertile inspiration that will enhance the authority of the United Nations around the globe. The United Nations will be enriched by the knowledge that is revealed. E/C.2/2025/2/Add.7 25-05862 6/12 4.

Brutal actions, in violation of human rights, causing intentional damage and injury to female genitalia, have affected about 200 million girls and women worldwide. Significant changes in the organization We are confronting digitalization and the digital divide, together with the rapidly expanding use of artificial intelligence. We are in the process of redirecting our communications and marketing strategy towards prevention in the light of new professions, as follows. Women and digitalization: working in the technology sector or the digital sector is not limited to being a coder, a developer or even an expert in digital marketing and communications. The digital world is an ecosystem. I decided to create a much clearer graphic to highlight the digital (#Tech) jobs that many of us overlook. Let\u2019s find out about the four categories of jobs in the digital sector. Technological jobs: \u2013 Jobs in infrastructure, systems and networks. \u2013 Jobs in development and testing. \u2013 Jobs in installation, support and maintenance. \u2013 Jobs in design and project management. Creative jobs: \u2013 Jobs in creation and design. E/C.2/2025/2/Add.7 25-05862 10/12 \u2013 Jobs in communications and marketing. \u2013 Jobs in project development and management. Analytical jobs: \u2013 Jobs in data, research and artificial intelligence. \u2013 Jobs in information security. Sales jobs: \u2013 Jobs in sales development. \u2013 Jobs in communications and marketing. The digital sector is constantly evolving, offering many career opportunities. It is a very broad sector, with a wide range of professions. We are in the process of drawing up reports on these four categories in collaboration with people from each area. Contribution of the organization to the work of the United Nations WAM seeks to achieve these aims by promoting fundamental principles such as love, honesty, trust, creativity, authenticity, autonomy, solidarity and selflessness as guidelines for private life and public engagement. The work of WAM begins in Geneva but can be expanded internationally if necessary. WAM is part of a global network of people active in similar areas of personal development. It pursues its aims without distinction as to nationality, race, sex, religious beliefs or political opinions. WAM operates independently of any political or economic authority, entity or organization. It maintains its autonomy while being governed by Swiss law in accordance with the principles listed in article 3.

On a daily basis, we pursue the objective of promoting education, health, social and humanitarian development and human rights. We maintain a presence throughout the country, including in the centre (Yaound\u00e9), on the coast (Douala), in the east (Bertoua) and in the far north (Maroua). Aims and purposes of the organization APPIFAPE aims to promote and protect the interests of families at risk and vulnerable people. We seek to achieve our aims through advocacy, activities on the ground, fundraising and partnerships with other organizations. Our main activities are: Health: establishment of a polyclinic to provide healthcare for refugees, pregnant women, children, internally displaced persons, the local population and people with chronic illnesses. Awareness-raising and efforts to prevent and reduce mortality from HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. Socioeconomic development: support for operational models for small trades and businesses under the socioeconomic development programme of Cameroon. Social integration of voluntary returnees in Cameroon. Cancer awareness and screening. Establishment of a legal clinic Significant changes in the organization Our organization has undergone a structural transformation, changing from an association into a non-governmental organization. Contribution of the organization to the work of the United Nations APPIFAPE contributes to the work of the United Nations through the following programmes and projects to promote health and well-being: Healthcare programme involving the establishment of polyclinics, one of which is operational, to provide care to families at risk. Cancer awareness and screening.

Socioeconomic development programme of Cameroon, which is designed to support the operational models of small trades and businesses and to boost their income to empower them. Project to provide legal assistance to people at risk by establishing a legal clinic. Social integration of returnees from Cameroon. Participation in meetings of the United Nations Our organization participated in a webinar on preparing an application for consultative status with the Economic and Social Council organized by the Non-Governmental Organizations Branch of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs on 5 May 2021 from 11 a.m. to 12.30 p.m. We shared relevant information in the application form for consultative status with the Council. Cooperation with United Nations bodies We participated in the implementation of a project for the prevention and reduction of mortality from HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis by 2023, which received a grant from the Global Fund in order to contribute to: \u2013 Reducing new HIV infections by 60 per cent by 2023. \u2013 Reducing mortality and morbidity related to HIV and tuberculosis by 2023. \u2013 Improving the quality of life of people living with or affected by HIV by 50 per cent by 2023. In collaboration with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, we took measures to improve the living conditions and enhance the integration of refugee women, including in the cities of Yaound\u00e9, Douala and Bertoua. Overall, we find it difficult to collaborate with the United Nations bodies in Cameroon, which are not open to proposals for collaboration. Initiatives taken by the organization in support of the Sustainable Development Goals Our work falls within the general framework of promoting the Sustainable Development Goals and contributes effectively to the achievement of several of the Goals, namely: Goal 1: by strengthening the financial autonomy of vulnerable groups; Goal 2: by providing nutritional support to poor families and vulnerable groups; Goal 3: by setting up a clinic to provide healthcare to vulnerable people; Goal 5: by promoting women\u2019s leadership; Goal 10: by financing small trades and businesses and boosting their income to empower them; Goal 16: by setting up a legal clinic to protect the rights of people, especially the most v",

International Association of Soldiers for Peace Special, 1995 Introduction Established in 1988, the International Association of Soldiers for Peace has enjoyed consultative status with the Economic and Social Council since 1995, and has commemorated the International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers every 29 May since 2002. Aims and purposes of the organization The Association brings together all former United Nations peacekeepers who have served in peacekeeping operations. It works to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and is active in peacekeeping, as well as in development and humanitarian efforts. Aware of the role it has to play in the international system as a major non-governmental organization, the Association has identified five areas of action: \u2022 Source of proposals for the international community \u2022 Establishment of associations in various countries \u2022 Social action \u2022 Humanitarian action \u2022 Conflict resolution Significant changes in the organization There has been little change since 2018. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) crisis restricted our development. We prioritized consolidating our action and areas of commitment. Nevertheless, we have continued to grow and to carry out humanitarian work, in particular by forging closer links with the World Health Organization. Contribution of the organization to the work of the United Nations We contribute to the organization of the International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers, which is commemorated every 29 May. We cooperate with the Peacekeeping Service, and seek to expand our Association by bringing together delegations of former United Nations peacekeepers from around the world. We also seek to highlight the work carried out by the United Nations. Participation in meetings of the United Nations Our non-governmental organization has taken part in human rights conferences. For years, we have been following the conferences on the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction, as well as the work towards a disarmament treaty, while collaborating with the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Cooperation with United Nations bodies We co-organize the commemoration of the International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers in Geneva with the Department of Public Information and other non-governmental organizations. We have met the Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations, Jean-Pierre Lacroix. E/C.2/2025/2/Add.9 3/11 25-06291 Initiatives taken by the organization in support of the Sustainable Development Goals We work to educate young people through an international programme called Jeunes faiseurs de paix (Young Peacemakers), which operates in four countries (France, Russia, Ukraine and India). The programme serves to raise awareness of peace, the United Nations and human development. We contribute to a humanitarian programme that addresses emergencies and development by sending containers to Lebanon, Chad and Ukraine. We are also planning trips to distribute this humanitarian aid to the people who are suffering. In addition, we contribute to the training of environmental police in order to protect natural areas. Lastly, the Acad\u00e9mie internationale de la paix (International Peace Academy) works on conflict resolution and raises awareness of the issue in academia. 2.",

Ligue marocaine de la citoyennet\u00e9 et des droits de l\u2019homme Special, 2015 Introduction Firstly, we apologize for the delay in submitting our fourth report, which is the result of technical and objective factors. For example: \u2022 Due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic crisis and the reduction in support and partners, the number of employees responsible for the technical aspects of our work has been reduced; \u2022 The President of the Ligue marocaine de la citoyennet\u00e9 et des droits de l\u2019homme, who directly oversees organizational matters, was arrested for his participation in a demonstration in honour of women (on 8 March 2021) and sentenced to eight months, and then six months. However, our firm belief in human rights and the determination of our activists have enabled us to overcome those difficulties, and we are now on the right track. The Ligue marocaine pour la citoyennet\u00e9 et les droits de l\u2019homme is an independent non-governmental organization dedicated to promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms in Morocco. It has close to 9,000 members in Morocco and in Europe. Women, young people and intellectuals organize most of its activities. \u2022 Aims and purposes of the organization Advocacy for: \u2022 Fundamental and non-fundamental rights \u2022 Individual and collective rights \u2022 Civil and political rights \u2022 Economic and social rights \u2022 Environmental and cultural rights \u2022 The environmental, cultural and development rights known as third-generation rights \u2022 The Sustainable Development Goals E/C.2/2025/2/Add.9 25-06291 4/11 Significant changes in the organization The organization has joined the Coalition for an Effective African Court on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights. It has established several partnerships with African human rights non- governmental organizations aimed at exchanging experiences and enabling them to benefit from our experience with international human rights mechanisms. Contribution of the organization to the work of the United Nations The organization has partnered with the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry for Human Rights to organize several university courses and training events at the national level. It has also prepared annual reports on economic, social and cultural rights in Morocco and observes most world days. Participation in meetings of the United Nations The organization has participated in several important activities and sessions of the United Nations, in particular those relating to human rights, universal periodic reviews of States and the sixty-second session of the Commission on the Status of Women, which was held at United Nations Headquarters in New York from 12 to 23 March 2018. Cooperation with United Nations bodies The organization regularly submits alternative reports to United Nations bodies; for example, it submitted an alternative report to the periodic report in connection with the universal periodic review of Morocco in 2022. Initiatives taken by the organization in support of the Sustainable Development Goals The organization is firmly committed to promoting the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, particularly in such areas as violations of the rights of women, the restriction of democratic space, peace, security, respect for individual freedoms, health and the environment. The organization has prepared a socioeconomic study on Indigenous women in Morocco that included more than 27,000 women. The organization organizes events in a number of cities throughout Morocco in observance of the following world days: World Habitat Day, World Health Day, International Day of Forests, International Literacy Day, International Day for the Eradication of Poverty and World AIDS Day. 3.

This document reflects our concerted efforts, the challenges we have overcome and the significant achievements we have made over the past four years. We have been delayed for reasons beyond our control, for which we apologize. E/C.2/2025/2/Add.9 5/11 25-06291 Since its inception, Parlement africain de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 civile has been committed to promoting education, health, sustainable development, human rights, democracy, good governance and environmental protection, with the ultimate goal of strengthening the resilience and well-being of the communities we serve. This report provides a detailed overview of our initiatives, impact and lessons learned. We would like to thank the United Nations system, in particular the Economic and Social Council and all our partners, for their unwavering support and commitment to our mission. Together, we have been able to transform lives and create lasting opportunities for a better future. As we look to the years ahead, we remain committed to continuing our work with the same passion and determination. We hope this report will encourage you to continue to support us on this humanitarian journey. Aims and purposes of the organization Our organization\u2019s goal is to promote human rights, democracy and good governance. It contributes to the work of the United Nations and the African Union as it relates to the promotion of socioeconomic cohesion, development, protection of the environment, education, health and various sustainable development programmes. It works to consolidate a peaceful society guided by values through awareness- building, dialogue and consultation, while also participating in programmes to combat poverty and all forms of social injustice. It supports the State in its ongoing quest for the well-being of its entire population and participates in initiatives designed to allow Africa to shine on the international stage. Significant changes in the organization There have been no significant changes in the organization\u2019s functioning. However, it is planning to change its status to become an organization with special status with the Economic and Social Council. It is also worth noting that the organization now has its headquarters in Abidjan, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. The organization\u2019s Secretary-General has been replaced by Mr. Bleu Nawa Pierre. Contribution of the organization to the work of the United Nations Like the Council\u2019s other member entities, the organization went through a difficult period that distanced it from the work of the United Nations. This was not least because of the long period of crisis caused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and a protracted illness suffered by its President. Nevertheless, it organized meetings on migration, in Algeria, North Africa, with the participation of United Nations human rights experts, as well as the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the United Nations Development Programme. The organization also sent a delegation to take part in the sixty-sixth and sixty-seventh sessions of the Commission on the Status of Women, held in New York.

R\u00e9seau des plateformes d\u2019ONG d\u2019Afrique de l\u2019ouest et du centre (REPAOC) Special, 2015 Introduction R\u00e9seau des plateformes d\u2019ONG d\u2019Afrique de l\u2019ouest et du centre (REPAOC) has strengthened the capacities of its members, advocated better public policies for equitable and sustainable development, promoted forums for exchanges and partnerships, and implemented projects. Its projects include the provision of technical assistance to the Organization for Strengthening Health Systems and Vaccination of Francophone Africa; monitoring of the implementation of the interim economic partnership agreements between the European Union and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, and the European Union and Ghana; and support for national civil society platforms in their monitoring of progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals. Concerned by the security crisis in the region, in 2022 REPAOC took the initiative to develop a civil society response entitled \u201cCommunity Resilience and Peacebuilding Project in West Africa\u201d. To date, it has not found funding to implement the response. The project was presented to the West African Development Bank and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Bank for Investment and Development in the context of the partnership between public development banks and civil society organizations advocated by the Finance in Common Summits, but no action has been taken, while the attacks continue to claim victims (dead, wounded, internally displaced persons and refugees). The period 2019\u20132022 was marked by the current Regional Coordinator of REPAOC, Mr. Comlan Julien Agbessi, taking office on 9 September 2019; the strengthening of the organization\u2019s institutional framework; the effects of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on the functioning of civil society organizations; the expansion of the security crisis towards the countries with coastlines on the Gulf of Guinea; and the drying up of funding sources for civil society organizations. Aims and purposes of the organization Our aim is to support collective civil society action in West Africa by strengthening national platforms for civil society organizations to enable them to effectively contribute to sustainable development and the promotion of human rights. Our objectives are to: E/C.2/2025/2/Add.9 7/11 25-06291 1. Strengthen regional dialogue and the collective action of national platforms by facilitating the operation of the organization and revitalizing its work; 2. Promote strategic thinking, present common positions and ensure greater representation of West African non-governmental organizations in regional and international governmental and non-governmental forums; 3. Strengthen the organization and capacities of national platforms for non-governmental organizations by developing services for members and promoting exchanges with other civil society actors; 4. Support the involvement of civil society organizations in public policy development. Significant changes in the organization Elaboration of a new strategic development plan for the period 2023\u20132027, a code of ethics and conduct (in English and French), and a manual on human resources management to complement the existing manual on accounting and financial procedures. Contribution of the organization to the work of the United Nations The organization has contributed to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 3 by providing technical assistance to the Organization for Strengthening Health Systems and Vaccination of Francophone Africa to promote immunization for all children and access to healthcare for all people in disadvantaged and hard-to-reach communities; to Sustainable Development Goal 5, by recommending, at the Girls\u2019 World Summit held on 21 and 22 October 2021 in Lom\u00e9, the adoption by all African States of laws criminalizing rape and paedophilia, along the lines of the law adopted by Senegal on 10 January 2020; by participating in the initial validation of an advocacy study report on the state of gender equality and women\u2019s rights, on 11 February 2020 in Dakar; and by issuing a statement from the organization following the",

That unique concept enables us to build or rebuild towards a better living environment and greater self-confidence for better integration. Aims and purposes of the organization Our goal is to make a name for our NGO, first within our country (France), then in Europe thanks to, inter alia, our activities with our transparency registry, and then at the international level thanks to our contacts through the United Nations and other NGOs. Our NGO, which has been granted consultative status, has a unique approach to education and courses of action. Our activities are focused on sports and music, and, as a municipal police officer, we have educational projects for young people in need, with a view to enabling a vision of a better society. Significant changes in the organization Three months ago, we decided to collaborate much less with Ms. Michiyo Shibahara for various reasons relating to communication and the activities that she carried out abroad without informing us. She gave the instruction to establish an association and hire people that our Executive Director did not know. We gave her an ultimatum. Our NGO has only one Executive Director, Mr. Fabrice Robeaux, a secretary and a treasurer. We only have honorary members (volunteers). In our NGO, we are all volunteers.

Ngoma Club Special, 2012 Introduction Ngoma Club is a non-profit association (\u201cassociation sans but lucratif\u201d under Congolese law) established in April 2007 at the University of Kinshasa. It later extended its field of activities throughout the city of Kinshasa, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Ngoma Club is a non-profit association of a cultural, educational and scienti\ufb01c character. It is apolitical, secular and does not discriminate on the basis of race or gender. Aims and purposes of the organization Ngoma Club has the following aims and purposes: \u2013 Promote a framework for complementary self-training for its members.

Significant changes in the organization Since 2017, we have been establishing provincial youth committees in 15 provinces to raise awareness and train more young people so that they realize the important role they play and are aware of the United Nations goals for sustainable peace in the world. In late 2023, we established committees in six additional provinces despite logistical difficulties relating to equipment and the training of personnel. Contribution of the organization to the work of the United Nations Over a nearly 19-month period between 2020 and 2023, it was difficult for our representatives to participate in United Nations activities because of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.

Introduction 1. The present report provides a comprehensive assessment of the implementation of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) since the previous report issued on 12 March 2025 (S/2025/153) and highlights continuing progress, as well as areas of prevailing concern. While the cessation of hostilities, albeit fragile, continued to hold and the parties reiterated their commitment to the full implementation of resolution 1701 (2006), violations of the resolution persisted. 2. There was no progress with respect to the withdrawal of the Israel Defense Forces from Lebanese territory pursuant to the 27 November 2024 cessation of hostilities agreement. The Israel Defense Forces retained a presence at five positions and two so-called buffer zones north of the Blue Line (S/2025/153, para. 1). The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) detected or observed several trajectories of projectiles fired from north of the Blue Line towards south of the Blue Line, and unauthorized weapons were identified in the UNIFIL area of operations for follow-up action by the Lebanese Armed Forces on multiple occasions, while the Israel Defense Forces repeatedly struck targets inside Lebanon. 3. The reporting period was also characterized by the concerted effort of the Lebanese authorities, led by the President, Joseph Aoun, and a newly formed Government under the Prime Minister, Nawaf Salam, to assert and extend the authority of the State throughout Lebanon. The new Government took steps towards the extension of State authority in line with its ministerial statement, including across security, economic and judicial sectors, as well as through the conduct of municipal elections. The period witnessed the ongoing deployment and strengthening of the Lebanese Armed Forces south of the Litani River where, including with support from UNIFIL, it made progress in dismantling unauthorized non-State military infrastructure and seizing unauthorized weapons. Lebanese leaders stated their commitment to enforcing the State\u2019s monopoly on arms across the country, including in Palestine refugee camps. * Reissued for technical reasons on 29 July 2025. S/2025/460 25-10794 2/29 II. Implementation of resolution 1701 (2006) A. Cessation of hostilities 4. During the reporting period, UNIFIL radars detected 220 trajectories of projectiles fired from south to north of the Blue Line and 1 trajectory of a projectile fired from north to south of the Blue Line. UNIFIL radars also detected seven trajectories of projectiles, and peacekeepers observed eight trajectories of projectiles, fired from north to south, that did not cross the Blue Line. Each trajectory may represent multiple projectiles. Almost all trajectories recorded were of rockets, mortar and artillery shells. UNIFIL radars cannot detect some types of projectiles, such as air-to-surface missiles, tank rounds, portable anti-tank missiles or those fired from light weapons. UNIFIL detected 67 air strikes by the Israel Defense Forces north of the Blue Line. In addition, UNIFIL observed the Israel Defense Forces shelling areas north of the Blue Line on 118 occasions and opening fire from south to north of the Blue Line on 22 occasions.

Recurring strikes by the Israel Defense Forces on alleged Hizbullah targets both south and north of the Litani River, including in the eastern Biqa\u2018 and near population centres such as the southern suburbs of Beirut, Nabatiyah, Sidon and Tyre, continued through the reporting period, causing casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure. Since 27 November 2024, at least 79 Lebanese civilians have been killed by Israeli military operations, including 15 women and 10 children, with no reported Israeli casualties. Thousands of Israelis remain displaced from northern Israel. 6. The most significant exchanges of fire since the cessation of hostilities came into effect occurred in March. On 22 March, UNIFIL detected three trajectories of projectiles launched from Kafr Tibnit, north of the Litani River, which landed north of the Blue Line. The Israel Defense Forces announced that three projectiles had \u201ccrossed into Israel from Lebanon and were intercepted in \u2026 Metulla\u201d.",

Later the same day, UNIFIL observed 14 Israel Defense Forces air strikes in the UNIFIL area of operations, as well as indirect fire towards Arnun, Kafr Kila, Khiyam and Taybah (all Sector East). The Israel Defense Forces subsequently conducted its first raid on Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs since 27 November, stating that it targeted \u201cHezbollah infrastructure used to store UAVs [uncrewed aerial vehicles]\u201d.

The Israel Defense Forces again struck Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs on 27 April, stating that it targeted a \u201cterrorist infrastructure site containing precision Hizbullah missiles\u201d. The same day, Mr. Netanyahu and the Minister of Defence of Israel, Israel Katz, issued a joint statement, as follows: \u201cIsrael will not allow Hizbullah to grow stronger and pose any threat to it \u2013 anywhere in Lebanon\u201d. 9. On 5 June, following air strikes on Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs, Mr. Katz stated, \u201cPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and I have instructed the IDF to \u2026 destroy buildings used to manufacture and store drones by the terrorist organization Hezbollah\u201d. On 6 June, the Lebanese Armed Forces stated that \u201cimmediately after the Israeli enemy announced its threats, it began coordinating with the Cessation of Hostilities Monitoring Mechanism to prevent an attack. Patrols also headed to a number of sites to inspect them, despite the enemy\u2019s rejection of the proposal [\u2026]\u201d and that \u201cthe Israeli enemy\u2019s persistent violation of the agreement and its refusal to cooperate with the Cessation of Hostilities Monitoring Mechanism only weakens the role of the Committee and the Army and could lead the military establishment to freeze cooperation with the Cessation of Hostilities Monitoring Mechanism regarding site inspections\u201d. 10. UNIFIL observed several drone strikes by the Israel Defense Forces south of the Litani River, including on vehicles in Naqurah on 5 March, on the Bint Jubayl-Yarun road on 3 April and on the Tyre-Abbasiyah road on 20 June, as well as on a motorbike in Yatar on 27 May (all Sector West). From April, the mission observed strikes on prefabricated structures near the Blue Line, including in Naqurah on 3 and 6 April and in Shama on 23 May (both Sector West). The Israel Defense Forces stated that those strikes targeted \u201cmilitary sites \u2026 belonging to Hizbullah\u201d, while Lebanese officials stated the prefabricated buildings were used to house municipal services pending the reconstruction of civilian infrastructure. UNIFIL also heard or detected explosions on 28 occasions, consistent with media reports of strikes on prefabricated buildings or vehicles. 11.

On 23 February, Mr. Netanyahu stated that the Israel Defense Forces would maintain a presence in the designated positions \u201cuntil the Lebanese Army and Lebanese Government fulfil all their obligations under the agreement\u201d. On 11 March, Mr. Aoun appealed to the head of the mechanism established pursuant to the cessation of hostilities to pressure Israel to \u201cimplement the agreement, withdraw from the five hills [positions], and return the Lebanese prisoners\u201d. 14. UNIFIL also observed the Israel Defense Forces firing at vehicles passing near those positions on three occasions and heard gunfire on another eight occasions. On 9 March, UNIFIL observed the Israel Defense Forces firing at individuals, including children, near the Israel Defense Forces position near Kafr Kila, killing an off-duty Lebanese Armed Forces soldier and injuring three others, including a woman and a second off-duty Lebanese Armed Forces soldier.

On 7 March, UNIFIL observed the Israel Defense Forces moving the fence across the tomb of Shaykh Abbad/the site of Rav Ashi, located directly on the Blue Line near Hula (Sector East), preventing access from the north while facilitating dozens of visitors from the south. The Lebanese Armed Forces stated that \u201cthe entry of settlers from Israel into Lebanese territory is one aspect of the enemy\u2019s persistence in violating international laws \u2026 resolution 1701 (2006) and the ceasefire agreement\u201d. The Israel Defense Forces informed UNIFIL that it subsequently took action to prevent Israeli civilians from gaining access to the area. On 17 and 20 June, north-east of Arab al-Luwayzah, UNIFIL observed six individuals who said that they were Israeli civilian workers with authorization to repair a water pump belonging to Ghajar municipality. The Israel Defense Forces informed UNIFIL that it had no knowledge of the activity. 16.

At the funeral of Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut on 23 February, the Secretary- General of Hizbullah, Naim Qassem, announced, \u201cThe most important step we took was for the State to assume its responsibility after the resistance prevented the enemy from invading or from achieving its objectives\u201d. On 29 March, he stated, \u201cIf Israel\u2019s attacks on Lebanon continue and the Lebanese State does not act to stop them, the group will eventually resort to other alternatives\u201d. 28. President Aoun stated on 14 April that \u201cthe dialogue regarding the arms monopoly will be bilateral between the presidency and Hizbullah\u201d. On 11 May, he stated that \u201cthe decision to restrict the possession of weapons to the State has been taken \u2026 The solution lies in dialogue, even with the Palestinian Authority\u201d. On 19 June, Mr. Aoun stated that \u201ccommunications are underway to achieve the principle of exclusive arms control on both the Lebanese and Palestinian fronts\u201d and \u201cwill intensify once the current regional instability, caused by the escalating Israeli-Iranian conflict, subsides\u201d. 29. On 18 April, Mr. Qassem stated that Hizbullah \u201cwill not allow anyone to disarm the resistance\u201d. He further stated that the \u201cIsraeli withdrawal and halting the aggression are important steps toward engaging in a discussion on the defense strategy. The defense strategy is about how to build Lebanon\u2019s strength, how to strengthen the army, and how to benefit from the resistance and its weapons. It is not about disarmament, but about discussing diplomatic, economic, and military levels in a comprehensive defense policy\u201d. 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 UNIFIL findings Disposed by the Lebanese Armed Forces S/2025/460 25-10794 8/29 30. On 25 April, the Speaker of Parliament, Nabih Berri, stated, \u201cWe will not hand over Hizbullah\u2019s arms. The arms are our trump card, which we will not abandon without the full implementation of the ceasefire agreement and without initiating dialogue. What was required of us are two things that Lebanon has accomplished: deploying the army in the South and the withdrawal of the \u2018party\u2019 from the area\u201d. 31. The Israel Defense Forces claimed numerous strikes on weapons caches, production sites and storage facilities allegedly belonging to Hizbullah, both south and north of the Litani River.

On 2 May, the Higher Defence Council, chaired by President Aoun, warned \u201cHamas against using Lebanese territory to carry out any acts that would harm Lebanon\u2019s national security\u201d. The Lebanese Armed Forces subsequently announced the arrests of several Hamas-affiliated Palestinians suspected of involvement in the rocket launches on 22 and 28 March. Three suspects were handed over to the Lebanese Armed Forces by Hamas between 4 and 6 May, including at Ein El Hilweh camp in Sidon and El Buss camp in Tyre. 33. During a visit to Beirut by the President of the State of Palestine, Mahmoud Abbas, on 21 May, Presidents Abbas and Aoun issued a joint statement that reaffirmed their mutual commitment to \u201cthe principle of the exclusivity of arms in the hands of the Lebanese State\u201d.

Clashes between residents of Beddawi camp near Tripoli and the adjacent Wadi al-Nahlah area on 18 March prompted the deployment of the Lebanese Armed Forces. Following persistent unrest in Beddawi camp, the Lebanese Armed Forces closed several official and unofficial camp entrances. Intense clashes between rival criminal groups from 18 to 20 May forced the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) to temporarily suspend operations in Shatila camp in southern Beirut. Four UNRWA schools in Ein El Hilweh remain inaccessible owing to the continued presence of armed actors. E. Arms embargo and border control 35.

The letter baselessly and unjustifiably references Iran, falsely alleging the transfer of weapons and funds to Hezbollah. The Islamic Republic of Iran, once more, categorically rejects this unfounded accusation\u201d. 37. On 27 March in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, Lebanese and Syrian interim defense officials stated they would \u201cfollow up on the strategic issue of border demarcation, establish specialized joint committees and activate coordination mechanisms to address security threats, particularly those arising along the border\u201d.

Lebanon continued to face conflict-related humanitarian needs. As at 31 May, at least 82,000 people, 51 per cent of whom are women, remain displaced. The continued presence of the Israel Defense Forces north of the Blue Line, in combination with continued kinetic activity, the presence of unexploded ordnance and extensive damage to civilian infrastructure, impedes returns. Humanitarian partners continued to support conflict-affected communities in meeting essential food, shelter, water, protection and healthcare needs amid security and funding constraints. Reconstruction and recovery needs were estimated at $11 billion according to the report of the World Bank dated 7 March 2025 entitled \u201cLebanon rapid damage and needs assessment\u201d. S/2025/460 11/29 25-10794 49. At its 31 March conclusion, the extended Lebanon flash appeal, which had called for an additional $371.4 million, was 26 per cent funded.

The UNIFIL Maritime Task Force operated with five vessels and 699 military personnel, including 66 women (9.44 per cent). There were 44 military observers, including 34 men and 10 women (23 per cent), from the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization serving with the Observer Group Lebanon under the operational command and control of UNIFIL. The highest-ranking military women hold the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, while the most senior civilian woman serves at the D-2 level. 52. UNIFIL conducted an average of 4,356 operational activities each month. Of those activities, 784 (18 per cent) involved mixed-gender teams. UNIFIL also undertook an average of 45 air patrols each month. 53. In line with the adaptation plan of UNIFIL, and as part of adjusting to a new context, UNIFIL operations focused on assisting the Lebanese Armed Forces in deploying to the South Litani Sector, providing a safe and secure environment and preventing violations of resolution 1701 (2006). To enable the full resumption of operational activities, including in support of the extension of State authority and to facilitate the return of displaced communities, UNIFIL removed more than 100 roadblocks, cleared unexploded ordnance, reopened and assessed secondary roads and re-established access the Blue Line. The Lebanese Armed Forces, in close coordination with UNIFIL, also removed roadblocks repeatedly placed by the Israel Defense Forces near Labbunah in April and Markaba in May.",

The Lebanese Armed Forces, in close coordination with UNIFIL, also removed roadblocks repeatedly placed by the Israel Defense Forces near Labbunah in April and Markaba in May. UNIFIL continued to engage with the parties regarding the use of new technology for monitoring and reporting and for the purposes of force protection. 54. UNIFIL experienced an increase in incidents of restrictions on freedom of movement since late April, with members of local communities stopping patrols and S/2025/460 25-10794 12/29 erroneously asserting that UNIFIL personnel must be accompanied by the Lebanese Armed Forces. Incidents were often filmed by the perpetrators and videos were circulated on social media. A particularly concerning incident occurred on 16 May in Jumayjimah (Sector West), during which UNIFIL peacekeepers returned fire after an isolated shooter fired approximately 20 shots towards the peacekeepers as they were moving away from an angry crowd. UNIFIL also experienced incidents involving the Israel Defense Forces, including the pointing of weapons and direct fire at a United Nations position in Shab\u2018a (Sector East) on 13 May. One bullet hit the defensive barrier of a United Nations position. The mission continued to encounter roadblocks around the five Israel Defense Forces positions and so-called buffer zones north of the Blue Line, restricting access to five United Nations positions and the full length of the Blue Line (see annex I). UNIFIL issued an increasing number of statements, gave interviews and conducted in-person and virtual media visits to clarify its mandate and activities and counter misinformation and disinformation. 55. The UNIFIL Maritime Task Force in support for maritime interdiction operations, hailed 2,476 vessels. The Lebanese Armed Forces inspected and cleared each of the 406 vessels referred by UNIFIL. The mission accompanied the Lebanese Armed Forces-Navy during 36 vessel inspections. 56. Pursuant to Security Council resolution 2436 (2018), UNIFIL assessed 22 subordinate military units and 3 vessels for logistics, training and operational preparedness on 17 June, with all shortfalls addressed. Utilizing the Comprehensive Planning and Performance Assessment System, UNIFIL continued to assess the adaptation of the mission\u2019s posture, footprint and operations to ensure mandate implementation. The mission also applied the indicators of the Action for Peacekeeping Plus monitoring framework to enhance its data-driven analysis and reporting. B. Safety and security 57. The designated officials for North Litani River and South Litani River continued to coordinate to ensure the safety and security of all United Nations personnel in Lebanon. From 1 March, dependants of international United Nations civilian personnel were permitted to return to the North Litani River designated area. Restrictions on non-programme critical civilian personnel in South Litani River (S/2024/817, para. 71) were lifted on 25 March. Movement restrictions remained in place in the South Litani River area of operations, with the use of armoured vehicles, as well as 48 hours\u2019 notice, required for movement of civilian personnel in the South Litani Sector, except in Tyre and along the Tyre-Naqurah coastal road. 58. Kinetic activity, unexploded ordnance and other remnants of war continued to pose a threat to the safety and security of personnel. On 22 March, the Israel Defense Forces struck central Tyre; 14 national and 49 international civilian United Nations personnel resided within 1,000 m of the impact site. From 13 June, in the context of the hostilities between Israel and the Islamic Republic of Iran, and in view of the risk of falling debris, UNIFIL personnel along the Blue Line sheltered on 55 occasions (see annex I). From 13 June, the mission reduced independent operational activities and activities near the Blue Line as a security precaution. 59. UNIFIL opened one technical investigation into violations of resolution 1701 (2006) that involved direct impacts on UNIFIL personnel or assets. The mission concluded five technical investigations and shared its findings with the parties. S/2025/460 13/29 25-10794 C. Conduct and discipline 60. UNIFIL recorded 12 allegations of possible unsatisfactory conduct, including 1 allegation of sexual harassment.

The mission concluded five technical investigations and shared its findings with the parties. S/2025/460 13/29 25-10794 C. Conduct and discipline 60. UNIFIL recorded 12 allegations of possible unsatisfactory conduct, including 1 allegation of sexual harassment. No allegations of sexual abuse and exploitation were reported in UNIFIL or the Office of the United Nations Special Coordinator for Lebanon. Training on United Nations standards of conduct was provided to 72 civilian and 2,546 military personnel (188 women and 2,430 men). D. Accountability for attacks on peacekeepers 61. UNIFIL continued to monitor proceedings in Lebanese military courts against individuals suspected of planning or perpetrating serious attacks against peacekeepers. The next trial hearing in the case of the fatal attack against UNIFIL near Aqibiyah on 14 December 2022 (see S/2023/184) is scheduled for 17 September 2025. There was no progress in criminal proceedings related to the 4 August 2018 incident in Majdal Zun (Sector West) (see S/2018/1029). Investigations into acts of aggression against UNIFIL peacekeepers in Shaqra on 22 December 2021, in Bint Jubayl on 4 January 2022 and in Ramiyah on 25 January 2022 continued (see S/2022/214). The investigation into the attack on a UNIFIL convoy outside Rafic Hariri International Airport, Beirut, on 14 February, which resulted in injuries to the former Deputy Force Commander and one other peacekeeper (S/2025/153, para. 56), is ongoing. An investigation has been initiated into the incident on 10 June in Dayr Qanun al-Nahr (see annex I); one suspect has been detained and referred to the military prosecutor. V. Liaison and progress towards sustainable solutions 62. The United Nations Special Coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis- Plasschaert, offered her good offices with relevant authorities and actors in Lebanon, Israel and the region, to support the cessation of hostilities and to advocate for the parties to take concrete steps towards negotiated solutions and to advance long-stalled provisions of resolution 1701 (2006). She continued to urge all parties, through public and closed-door channels, to leverage the political momentum provided by the cessation of hostilities agreement to forge new political pathways towards the full implementation of resolution 1701 (2006). 63. UNIFIL continued its engagement with the parties to promote security arrangements aimed at facilitating the withdrawal of the Israel Defense Forces from areas north of the Blue Line. UNIFIL hosted the sixth meeting of the mechanism, on 11 March, following which UNIFIL supported the return to Lebanon of four individuals apprehended by the Israel Defense Forces in 2024. The Lebanese Armed Forces soldier apprehended by the Israel Defense Forces on 9 March (see para. 14 above) was repatriated on 13 March. 64. UNIFIL continued to utilize its liaison and coordination mechanisms to decrease tension along the Blue Line. There were 1,390 interactions with the Israel Defense Forces to deconflict movement with respect to the safety and security of the Lebanese Armed Forces, facilitating the deployment and operations of the Lebanese Armed Forces, including inspections of locations of interest, removal of roadblocks and facilitation of the return of displaced communities. UNIFIL issued 24 stop-firing requests to the Israel Defense Forces, including 5 on behalf of the Lebanese Armed Forces and 19 for the mission. In complement, the Special Coordinator for Lebanon leveraged diplomatic means in support of de-escalation measures. S/2025/460 25-10794 14/29 65. In support of the protection of civilians, UNIFIL maintained liaison with both parties and facilitated 314 civilian and humanitarian movements. The Humanitarian Access Working Group, which oversees the humanitarian notification system, continued to coordinate access to hard-to-reach areas across Lebanon. In late February, the Israel Defense Forces informed the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs that it would no longer actively deconflict humanitarian movements north of the Litani River. A limited number of humanitarian notifications continued to be channelled by the Office through UNIFIL for movements within three km of the Blue Line. 66. In March, UNIFIL initiated the repair and reconstruction of an estimated 40 Blue Line barrels damaged during the hostilities (see S/2025/153, para. 68 and annex I). Access to one destroyed barrel was cleared by the demining teams of UNIFIL. 67.",

The establishment of a UNIFIL liaison office in Tel Aviv remains pending, notwithstanding the agreement of Israel to the proposal made in 2008 for such an office. 68. The Syrian Arab Republic and Israel have yet to respond to the provisional definition of the Shab\u2018a Farms area proposed in my report of 30 October 2007 on the implementation of resolution 1701 (2006) (S/2007/641, annex). VI. Observations 69. Civilians on both sides of the Blue Line have endured far too much to risk a relapse into conflict. Noteworthy progress has been made towards realizing the commitments set out in the cessation of hostilities agreement. While the intensity of kinetic activity has decreased significantly since the cessation of hostilities came into effect, the situation remains fragile. A safe and secure environment conducive to the full return and rebuilding of communities on both sides of the Blue Line has yet to materialize. Towards this end, I call upon the parties to ensure the protection of civilians, accelerate political efforts to create the space for renewed dialogue towards the full implementation of resolution 1701 (2006) and, ultimately, a permanent ceasefire between Lebanon and Israel. I call upon all actors concerned to refrain from unilateral or provocative action that could jeopardize the return to the full cessation of hostilities. The failure, actual or perceived, by one party to meet its obligations under resolution 1701 (2006) is not a justification for the other party to renege on its obligations. I urge the parties to utilize the established liaison and coordination channels of UNIFIL, as well as the enhanced arrangements under the cessation of hostilities mechanism, to address disputes or threats and to prevent escalation. Regular meetings of the mechanism can enhance communication and shared problem- solving. I encourage such engagement at a strategic political level, in addition to military-to-military meetings concerning immediate operational-tactical issues. In addition, I welcome the efforts made by Lebanese leaders to spare the country from the hostilities between the Islamic Republic of Iran and Israel. 70. Welcoming the return by the Government of Israel of five Lebanese citizens who were being held in Israeli custody, I call for the release of the remaining Lebanese detainees. 71. Both parties have committed themselves to full respect for the Blue Line. However, the continued presence of the Israel Defense Forces north of the Blue Line and their continued use of force not only threatens stability along the Blue Line, but also undermines the efforts of the Lebanese authorities to extend the authority of the State. It risks fuelling a narrative that could further complicate the internal political S/2025/460 15/29 25-10794 discussions required for Lebanon to meet its commitments to achieve a State monopoly on arms. 72. The presence of the Israel Defense Forces north of the Blue Line is a violation of Lebanese sovereignty and territorial integrity and resolution 1701 (2006). I reiterate my condemnation of all violations of Lebanese sovereignty from Israel and call again for the Government of Israel to cease all overflights of Lebanese territory. I urge the Israeli authorities to fulfil their obligations under resolution 1701 (2006) to withdraw from all areas north of the Blue Line, including from northern Ghajar and the adjacent area north of the Blue Line. I reiterate, as provided for in resolution 1701 (2006), the offer of UNIFIL to support security arrangements that can strengthen the confidence of communities on both sides of the Blue Line. 73. The stated commitments by the Lebanese authorities to bring all weapons under State control and ensure that the State is able to exercise full sovereignty and authority over its territory, as well as the pledge to convene a dialogue towards formulation of a national security strategy, are encouraging. I note the progress made in strengthening the presence of the Lebanese Armed Forces between the Blue Line and the Litani River, including to dismantle unauthorized infrastructure and confiscate unauthorized arms and related materiel that were present in violation of resolution 1701 (2006).",

I note the progress made in strengthening the presence of the Lebanese Armed Forces between the Blue Line and the Litani River, including to dismantle unauthorized infrastructure and confiscate unauthorized arms and related materiel that were present in violation of resolution 1701 (2006). The action taken by the Lebanese Armed Forces to ensure that the area south of the Litani River is free of unauthorized weapons, including in response to the rocket launches in March, shows that the Government of Lebanon has the resolve necessary to meet its obligations under resolution 1701 (2006). I note the agreement between Presidents Abbas and Aoun regarding the Lebanese State\u2019s monopoly on arms, including inside Palestine refugee camps. It is imperative that the Lebanese Armed Forces continue to take the measures necessary to ensure a State monopoly over the possession of weapons throughout all of Lebanese territory. Extending my appreciation for the generous support provided to date, I call upon donors to bolster their material and financial support to the Lebanese Armed Forces commensurate with their commitment to the full implementation of resolution 1701 (2006). 74. I welcome the continued implementation by UNIFIL of its adaptation plan, including a new operational modus operandi. A return to full patrolling and monitoring across the area of operations conducted in an agile and nimble manner has proved key to operational effectiveness. I repeat my call upon the parties to support the continuous development of the Force, including through the deployment and use of new technologies to enhance its mandate implementation capacities. 75. The freedom of movement of UNIFIL is essential for the full implementation of resolution 1701 (2006). The increase in incidents affecting the freedom of movement of UNIFIL since April is of great concern. I welcome public statements from the Lebanese authorities expressing support for the mission and condemning attacks on peacekeepers. It is vital that national authorities continue to issue such statements to counter misinformation and disinformation regarding the mission\u2019s presence and to ensure the safety and security of peacekeepers. Perpetrators of attacks against UNIFIL must be held to account. The mission should also continue to strengthen its strategic communications strategy to enhance understanding of its mandated functions. 76. Firing by the Israel Defense Forces at or near UNIFIL personnel and premises is also unacceptable. I reiterate my appeal to both parties to comply with their obligations under international law, including international humanitarian law, and ensure the safety and security of United Nations personnel, their freedom of movement and the inviolability of United Nations premises and property at all times. 77. I congratulate Prime Minister Salam on the formation of his Government and the holding of municipal elections to extend the authority of the State at the local S/2025/460 25-10794 16/29 level. Ahead of next year\u2019s parliamentary elections, I call upon the Government and Parliament to prioritize reforms strengthening inclusive electoral processes to enable further gains in women\u2019s political representation and accessibility for persons with disabilities. 78. While steps taken by the Government and Parliament towards the implementation of economic, financial and judicial reforms are encouraging, expedited progress is required, including legislation on the restructuring of the banking sector, necessary to secure IMF assistance, restore donor and depositor confidence, and help to put Lebanon back on the path towards sustainable recovery and for communities to rebuild their lives. Greater progress is also vital to unlock urgently needed reconstruction funding. Meanwhile, additional resources for humanitarian and recovery response are crucial. 79. I am hopeful that developments in the Syrian Arab Republic will yield positive implications for Lebanon, including to create the conditions necessary to enable the sustainable, safe, dignified and voluntary return of Syrian refugees. I call upon the international community to work with the Syrian interim authorities towards creating conditions conducive to such returns. The consistent application of legal and procedural safeguards, including the principle of non-refoulement, remains essential. Palestine refugee camps are already experiencing considerable hardship and volatility and may come under increased pressure as disarmament plans are rolled out.",

Palestine refugee camps are already experiencing considerable hardship and volatility and may come under increased pressure as disarmament plans are rolled out. It is therefore more critical than ever that UNRWA be able to continue its support to Palestine refugees in Lebanon. 80. I express my sincere gratitude to all countries contributing military personnel and equipment to UNIFIL and the Observer Group Lebanon. I thank the Special Coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, and the outgoing Head of Mission and Force Commander of UNIFIL, Lieutenant General Aroldo L\u00e1zaro S\u00e1enz, for their dedication and leadership throughout a very challenging period. I also thank the troop-contributing countries, whose forces continue to be vital to supporting the parties in upholding their obligations under the cessation of hostilities agreement and resolution 1701 (2006), and all members of the United Nations country team for their continued dedication to stability in Lebanon. S/2025/460 17/29 25-10794 Annex I Restriction of the freedom of access and movement of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon from 21 February to 20 June 2025 1. In paragraph 15 of its resolution 2695 (2023), the Security Council urged the parties to ensure that the freedom of movement of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) in all its operations, including access to all parts of the Blue Line, was fully respected and unimpeded. It called upon the Government of Lebanon to facilitate prompt and full access to sites requested by UNIFIL for the purpose of swift investigation, including all locations of interest, all relevant locations north of the Blue Line related to the discovery of tunnels crossing the Blue Line (as reported in S/2019/237) and unauthorized firing ranges, in line with resolution 1701 (2006), while respecting Lebanese sovereignty. 2. In line with UNIFIL\u2019s adaptation plan, UNIFIL moved away from a \u201cpatrol sketch\u201d (maps of planned patrol routes) oriented approach to a more \u201coperation-led\u201d modus operandi in March. Dedicated operations often spanned several days with different mission components working towards a joint end. \u201cPatrol sketches\u201d were at times used to facilitate the coordination of activities with the Lebanese Armed Forces but were not used to limit the freedom of movement of the Mission. During the reporting period, UNIFIL conducted a monthly average of 4,356 operational activities, including 45 air operations. The percentage of UNIFIL\u2019s operational activities conducted in close coordination with the Lebanese Armed Forces increased from 12 to 23 per cent, for an overall average of 16.8 per cent. 3. UNIFIL continued to update a list of locations of interest initiated after the return to the cessation of hostilities. As at 20 June, UNIFIL has identified 37 locations of interest and in close coordination with the Lebanese Armed Forces inspected 16 of these. 4. While UNIFIL\u2019s freedom of movement was in general respected, UNIFIL experienced some incidents in which violence or weapons were used to intimidate UNIFIL peacekeepers, incidents resulting in damage to UNIFIL equipment or injuries to peacekeepers, and incidents resulting in UNIFIL cancelling their activity or using alternatives routes. Incidents of particular note occurred on 16 May in Jumayjmeh and on 10 June in Dayr Qanun al-Nahr. In addition to the incidents listed below, UNIFIL experienced minor incidents during which items such as stones or bottles were thrown at UNIFIL property or personnel without causing damage or injuries. There were also incidents during which patrols have been stopped, surrounded or pursued by individuals in civilian clothes. Incidents were often filmed by those hindering UNIFIL, with videos circulated on social media. Each of the incidents listed below has been raised by the Mission with the Lebanese Armed Forces. 5. UNIFIL also experienced a number of incidents involving the Israel Defense Forces, interfering with operations or putting peacekeepers or UN staff members at risk. Incidents of note took place near Rumaysh on 29 March, near Kfar Shuba on 13 May, near Yarun on 19 May and near Kfar Kila on 16 June. UNIFIL has protested each of the incidents to the Israel Defense Forces. 6.

On 11 March, individuals in civilian clothes ripped off the antenna of a UNIFIL vehicle passing through Bayt Lif (Sector West). The Mayor of Bayt Lif was contacted, however, as at 20 June, the antenna has not been returned. 8. On 19 March an individual in civilian clothes drove up next to a UNIFIL patrol in Ayn Baal (Sector West) and damaged the left side mirrors of two UNIFIL vehicles with a club. The peacekeepers stopped to verify the damage and resumed the patrol movement shortly thereafter. 9. On 21 March, a group of 10 to 12 individuals in civilian clothes approached a UNIFIL patrol in Yarun (Sector West) and removed the UN flag from one vehicle while making unfriendly gestures. The UNIFIL patrol used an alternative route to continue. The Mayor of Yarun later informed UNIFIL that the incident was the act of unknown individuals. 10. On 21 March, two individuals in civilian clothes on a scooter approached a UNIFIL patrol near Burj al-Shamali (Sector West) and removed the flag from a vehicle. The patrol continued its movement. 11.

S/2025/460 25-10794 26/29 Annex II Implementation of the arms embargo 1. Paragraph 15 of resolution 1701 (2006) states that all States shall take the necessary measures to prevent, by their nationals or from their territories or using flag vessels or aircraft, the sale or supply of arms and related materiel to any entity or individual in Lebanon other than those authorized by the Government of Lebanon or the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). The United Nations continued to engage with Member States regarding allegations of weapons transfers and efforts to address such violations of resolution 1701 (2006). 2. In identical letters dated 29 May addressed to the President of the Security Council and to me (S/2025/337), the Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations stated that, \u201cHezbollah persists in its efforts to transfer money through Lebanon\u2019s border crossings, including via Beirut International Airport, and to smuggle arms across the Syria-Lebanon border, in direct violation of the arms embargo [\u2026]\u201d. The Permanent Representative further conveyed that [these actions] \u201cunderscore the strategic objective of Iran and Hezbollah to rearm and re-establish Hezbollah\u2019s military presence across Lebanon, spanning areas north and south of the Litani River\u201d. The Permanent Representative further stated: \u201cThe Security Council must also adopt measures to deter Iran from continuing its transfer of weapons and financial support to Hezbollah [\u2026] it is imperative that Member States take action to prevent the flow of funds to Hezbollah through their territories.\u201d 3. Following allegations reported in the media about Hizbullah weapons smuggling at the port of Beirut, President Aoun and Minister of Public Works and Transport Fayez Rasamny on 11 April conducted an inspection of the port. Two days earlier, Minister Rasamny, in a press conference at the port, stated: \u201cSecurity at the port is under close surveillance and we reject any media discourse that casts doubt on this matter.\u201d 4. As detailed in paragraph 55 of this report, the UNIFIL Maritime Task Force continued to support maritime interdiction operations, hailing 2,476 vessels. 5. The United Nations remains committed to supporting overall compliance by the parties with resolution 1701 (2006) in all its provisions and to advancing its implementation. This applies to the implementation of the arms embargo under paragraph 15 of resolution 1701 (2006) and any decision that would be adopted by the Security Council in this regard. I look forward to continued dialogue with the Council and its members on furthering our joint goal of the full implementation of resolution 1701 (2006).",

S/2025/460 27/29 25-10794 Annex III Mobilization of international support for the Lebanese Armed Forces 1. In paragraph 10 of its resolution 2695 (2023), the Security Council recalled paragraph 10 of its resolution 2591 (2021). It urged further and increased international support for the Lebanese Armed Forces, as the only legitimate armed forces of Lebanon, and all State security institutions, in response to the capabilities development plan of the Lebanese Armed Forces, as well as the framework of the International Support Group for Lebanon, through additional and expedited assistance in areas where the Lebanese Armed Forces are most critically in need of support, including daily logistical needs and maintenance, counter-terrorism, border protection, and naval capacity. 2. In identical letters dated 9 January 2024 addressed to the President of the Security Council and to the Secretary-General (S/2024/36), the Charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of Lebanon to the United Nations stated that, \u201cThe Government of Lebanon also requests support from the United Nations to help the Lebanese State extend its authority over the entirety of Lebanese territory by strengthening its armed forces. In particular, support should be provided for deployment of those forces south of the Litani River, and they should be provided with equipment in cooperation with [the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL)], so that there will be no weapons without the consent of the Government of Lebanon and no authority other than that of the Government of Lebanon, in accordance with paragraph 3 of resolution 1701 (2006).\u201d Subsequently, on 29 February 2024, Lebanon\u2019s then-caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati stated that to implement resolution 1701, the Army would need allied countries to help with everything from \u201cfuel to equipment to means of transportation to the barracks and even to weapons \u2013 everything the Army needs.\u201d 3. In a presidential statement adopted on 16 January 2025 (S/PRST/2025/1), the United Nations Security Council called for further international assistance to strengthen State institutions, including the Lebanese Armed Forces. 4. The Announcement of a Cessation of Hostilities and Related Commitments on Enhanced Security Arrangements and Toward the Implementation of UNSCR 1701, which was circulated to the United Nations Security Council by the United Kingdom in its capacity as President of the Security Council (S/2024/870), noted the intention of the United States and France to work with the Military Technical Committee for Lebanon and the wider international community to support enhanced Lebanese Armed Forces deployment to southern Lebanon and to strengthen the capabilities of the Army. 5. During the reporting period, regional and global leaders have continued to champion a surge in support aimed at enhancing the capabilities of the Lebanese Armed Forces to carry out its critical tasks. The Lebanese authorities have made several calls for increased international support to be channeled to the Army. 6. Support to the Lebanese Army has been a central theme of President Aoun\u2019s official visits in the region. In his visit to Riyadh on 3 March, a joint statement released by President Aoun and the Crown Prince and Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud emphasized the need to support and empower the Lebanese Armed Forces towards asserting the authority of the State across Lebanon. Following his visit to Doha, on 16 April President Aoun and his Qatari counterpart Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani released a joint communiqu\u00e9 which stated, \u201cBoth sides emphasized the national role of the Lebanese S/2025/460 25-10794 28/29 Army, the importance of supporting it, and the need to implement Resolution 1701 in all its provisions.\u201d The imperative to support the Lebanese Armed Forces was also cited during a 19 May press conference between President Aoun and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi during the former\u2019s official visit to Cairo.",

Jordan\u2019s support to the Lebanese Armed Forces was acknowledged according to a readout from His Majesty\u2019s office during a meeting on 10 June between President Aoun and King Abdullah II ibn Al Hussein. 7. Several commitments were announced by Member States in support of the Lebanese Armed Forces during the reporting period. On 18 June, a signing ceremony was held to mark Germany\u2019s commitment to provide \u20ac17.85 million to the Lebanese Armed Forces. The grant will be used to procure essential equipment, uniforms and material for the Army. On 16 April, during the above-mentioned trip by President Aoun to Doha, the Emir of the State of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, announced a $60 million grant to supplement the salaries of Lebanese Army personnel, as well as a commitment to provide military vehicles. In the reporting period, the Government of the Netherlands pledged an additional amount of \u20ac7.5 million for support to the Lebanese Armed Forces, to fund infrastructure, equipment, border control efforts, and mine action. 8. Several Member States provided equipment or other forms of in-kind support to bolster the capabilities of the Lebanese Armed Forces. The United States delivered additional assets and tactical support, including to advance explosive ordnance disposal, as well as infrastructural support. France and Italy provided equipment, logistics assistance, training-based capacity development, and livelihood and sustainment support, with T\u00fcrkiye also providing equipment. Assistance from the United Kingdom and France was used to enhance training centres and related infrastructure. The United Kingdom also continued its support to the Lebanese Armed Forces in the area of border management. Canadian support was directed towards the provision of uniforms and procurement of equipment, while both Canada and T\u00fcrkiye, alongside other donors, bolstered capacity building and training initiatives. France, Italy, the Netherlands, the Republic of Korea, and the United States channeled assistance to the Lebanese Armed Forces to provide direct support to local communities in southern Lebanon. 9. With a view to bolstering the coordination of international support to the Lebanese Armed Forces, a tripartite memorandum of understanding was signed on 14 May between the Office of the United Nations Special Coordinator for Lebanon (UNSCOL), the United Nations Development Programme in Lebanon, and Lebanon\u2019s Ministry of National Defense. The memorandum of understanding formalizes the \u201cLAF Livelihood Ecosystem\u201d project managed by the United Nations Development Programme to address the sustenance needs of Lebanese Armed Forces personnel and their families, in line with the Human Rights Due Diligence Policy. With the support of France, UNIFIL and the Lebanese Armed Forces signed a separate memorandum of understanding, on 10 June for the provision of non-lethal material support to the Lebanese Armed Forces. 10. As part of international resource mobilization efforts to support enhanced Lebanese Armed Forces deployment in southern Lebanon, the Military Technical Committee convened for a two-day meeting in Beirut and Naqurah on 20 and 21 March, respectively, and in Berlin on 10 and 11 June to take stock of existing support streams and identify remaining gaps. Both UNSCOL and UNIFIL participated as observers, with the latter hosting the Committee at its base in Naqurah on 21 March. A rise in candidacies for membership in the Military Technical Committee points to growing multilateral interest in supporting the Lebanese Armed Forces, with the membership of Cyprus confirmed by the Committee during its Berlin meeting in S/2025/460 29/29 25-10794 June. Since the inception of the Military Technical Committee in March 2024, $384 million has been mobilized. 11. Efforts to enhance the integration and complementarity of funding mobilized through the United Nations in support of the Lebanese Armed Forces continued during the reporting period. Donor funding totaling approximately $25 million, including pledges, from Denmark, France, Germany, Norway, and Spain, was channeled through the above-mentioned LAF Livelihood Ecosystem [see annex III, para. 9] in support of the Lebanese Armed Forces.",

A commitment to human rights is an essential condition for truly sustainable economic and social development for all. Respect for human rights helps to alleviate poverty, reduce the number of refugees and support the development of countries that are fragile, as is the case in Africa. As events regularly show, a State that does not respect women\u2019s rights and children\u2019s freedoms is acting against the interests of its people and represents a threat to them. Aims and purposes of the organization We work to protect and assist poor children and promote the empowerment of women and girls. To this end, we provide them with school enrolment support through a sponsorship system and give them the opportunity to flourish through tourist, social, cultural and artistic activities and intercultural exchanges between the global North and South. We seek to: support and initiate activities aimed at ensuring the well-being of children, women and girls; help disadvantaged children to enrol in school through a sponsorship system; promote and organize social and cultural, tourist and artistic activities; promote entrepreneurship in the areas of tourism, culture and art; encourage intercultural exchanges between the global North and South; offer training (capacity-building and career placement support); and promote and encourage the empowerment of women and girls in need. Significant changes in the organization Our headquarters is located at a new address, namely: 4 Cours Saint Vincent, 92130, Issy Les Moulineaux (France) 2. The organization has a new logo. Contribution of the organization to the work of the United Nations We are fervently advocating the acceleration of progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals, in particular Goal 1 (No poverty), Goal 2 (Zero hunger), Goal 3 (Good health and well-being), Goal 4 (Quality education) and Goal 5 (Gender equality).",

Cooperation with United Nations bodies We work in close collaboration with the Economic and Social Council by participating regularly in its meetings and adhering strictly to its rules. Initiatives taken by the organization in support of the Sustainable Development Goals We are firmly committed to promoting the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals on several fronts, including through our membership of a platform of African non-governmental organizations known as Diaspora africaine pour la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de l\u2019information. This platform is accredited to the Telecommunication Development Sector of the International Telecommunication Union, which seeks to close the North-South digital divide in Internet governance. Projects are under way to train women and young people in new information and communications technologies. Through such projects, we aim to create a space where innovative and stimulating ideas can be put forward to pave the way for African women to advance, become leaders and play their full part in running public and private enterprises, in accordance with ethical norms and in the interest of economic and social progress. 2.

The quadrennial report is a general policy document of the Economic and Social Council. Our report contains an account of our activities as an organization in consultative status with the Council. Aims and purposes of the organization AJED-Congo focuses primarily on environmental and social issues that have a negative impact on social development, health, youth education and entrepreneurship, poverty eradication and the improvement of socioeconomic living conditions for the most vulnerable persons, the status and rights of women, the rights of Indigenous Peoples and human rights, drugs and substance abuse. Significant changes in the organization There have been some personnel changes within the Executive Bureau of the organization. Contribution of the organization to the work of the United Nations A greater increase in renewable energies may drastically reduce the potential risks associated with the global threat of climate change, such as drought and flooding. This would give impetus to prevention programmes aimed at counteracting the dangers of climate change and environmental pollution. We should emphasize education and information and raise public awareness of human rights to prevent unspeakable human suffering and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in order to limit the impact of climate change and make the planet healthier. This should be a national and regional duty and requires international solidarity. Participation in meetings of the United Nations \u2013 Participation in the twenty-eighth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the eighteenth session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, to be held in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, from 30 November",

Aims and purposes of the organization Inspire a new approach to development by returning to our intrinsic African values in order to eliminate poverty in Africa and restore the image of Black people. The objectives are essentially the promotion of African culture (raising awareness of a new African citizenship); the defence of human rights, democracy and good governance; the strengthening of conflict prevention, management and resolution in Africa; the advancement of inclusive socioeconomic financing in Africa (decentralized financial systems); and the implementation of environmental ethics, corporate social responsibility and the Sustainable Development Goals.

The Board of Directors and the executive leadership work in perfect harmony to develop and implement the vision for Benin and Africa. Drawing on our best practices in transforming waste into green and sustainable energy (biogas) and biofertilizers, we have set up new bases in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Congo, and will soon set up a similar base in the Niger.

Significant changes in the organization Although there have been no major modifications to the organization\u2019s constitution or administrative regulations, its activities have been affected by the major political change recently experienced by the country as a result of the overthrow of the political regime that had been established in 2020 and of the consequent dissolution of the Constitution and of all the republican institutions in the country. This situation has led to the cessation of a number of political and economic initiatives implemented by the previous regime.

Alliance globale contre les mutilations g\u00e9nitales f\u00e9minines Special, 2016 Introduction Since its establishment, the Alliance globale contre les mutilations g\u00e9nitales f\u00e9minines has been committed to ensuring respect for human rights, in particular the right to health and, specifically, the fight against female genital mutilation. The goal is to contribute to the gradual elimination of this scourge, while ensuring strict respect for human rights within the framework of the rights established under international and national legal instruments, and in cooperation with other organizations focused on the same issue at the international level. Aims and purposes of the organization The Alliance globale contre les mutilations g\u00e9nitales f\u00e9minines currently aims to stay informed about the issue of female genital mutilation through various sources (the main civil society actors, the relevant items on the agenda of the Human Rights Council, the Special Rapporteur on the right to health and the work of certain specialized entities of the United Nations, mainly the World Health Organization, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund and the United Nations Population Fund). From our headquarters, we also follow the work of the Economic and Social Council subsidiary bodies of interest to us, including the Commission on the Status of Women, the Commission for Social Development and the Commission on Population and Development, as well as the progress made towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. Our information, in the form of internal documents, is primarily intended for the members and other friends of the Alliance, who, in turn, raise public awareness according to their own capabilities. Significant changes in the organization Because the Alliance\u2019s financial resources have been limited over the past four years, it has reduced its international travel, although it has preserved its initial ideals and view of the international issues relating to the topic, and has maintained its level of participation in the work of the above-mentioned mechanisms. Internal discussions led members to decide that, in the future, the Alliance could devote a greater proportion of its activities to the defence of human rights, particularly civil and political rights, and health. A proposed amended version of the Alliance\u2019s policies has been submitted to the secretariat of the Committee on Non-Governmental E/C.2/2025/2 24-20916 16/24 Organizations, but until it has been approved by the Committee, the Alliance will continue to pursue the aims and objectives recognized under its current consultative status with the Economic and Social Council. Contribution of the organization to the work of the United Nations For the reasons mentioned above, the Alliance has focused the activities of its representatives to the United Nations on monitoring the main decisions and guidance of the bodies mentioned in section 2, in order to keep its members and partners in the fight against female genital mutilation informed. Relaying and amplifying the main discussions and decisions of the Economic and Social Council has been one of our organization\u2019s priorities. Participation in meetings of the United Nations The Alliance\u2019s permanent representatives participated in all sessions of the Human Rights Council held during the period under review, from the forty-third session (from 24 February 2020 to 20 March 2020) to the fifty-fourth session (from 11 September 2023 to 13 October 2023). At each session and on the basis of the Council\u2019s provisional agenda, our representatives participated in the plenary meetings, focusing on the agenda items of interest to the Alliance (items 3 and 4, the presentation of the reports of the Special Rapporteurs with mandates centred on economic, social and cultural rights, in particular the right to health and the rights and protection of women, girls and children); in the meetings on the monitoring of the Sustainable Development Goals; and in various regular panels focused on the aforementioned categories of rights.",

Promoting international solidarity and preserving the environment for future generations. Significant changes in the organization Anaja remains true to its commitments and values. There have been no significant changes. Contribution of the organization to the work of the United Nations Anaja continues to conduct activities focused on three main areas: social and educational action; socioeconomic support for women; and initiatives to help young people to engage in income-generating activities for survival. \u2013 Social and educational action: purchase of supplies for over 70 students every year since 2020, support and school fees. \u2013 Socioeconomic action: more than 127 women were supported in their various agricultural, commercial and artisanal activities from 2020 to 2023. \u2013 Initiatives to support young people: support for providing youth with training and involving them in farming and livestock breeding, as well as promoting their participation in the arts. Participation in meetings of the United Nations The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic slowed down Anaja\u2019s activities at all levels and made it wary of participating in gatherings in 2020 and 2021. In 2024, Anaja participated in the United Nations Civil Society Conference, organized by Maher Nasser, Director of Outreach of the Department of Global Communications. Cooperation with United Nations bodies \u2013 Anaja contributed to the discussions on the theme \u201cReinforcing the 2030 Agenda and eradicating poverty in times of multiple crises: the effective delivery of sustainable, resilient and innovative solutions\u201d within the framework of the 2024 high-level political forum on sustainable development under the auspices of the Economic and Social Council. \u2013 Anaja has been working with the non-governmental organization Village Suisse ONG since 2022. Initiatives taken by the organization in support of the Sustainable Development Goals Sustainable development is a very important concept for the survival of humanity and is an integral part of the Sustainable Development Goals. Many women lack self-esteem and self-confidence. Anaja believes that sustainable development requires personal development, which entails having the self-knowledge necessary to manage oneself and the environment. Anaja has therefore set up a meditation and self- revitalization programme to achieve this inner knowledge.

A number of qualified women have also been trained in accounting, the Internet and production unit management. To ensure good health and timely care, all the women participating in our projects and activities \u2013 amounting to at least 200 women \u2013 have received screening tests for breast cancer, HIV, diabetes, hypertension and sexually transmitted diseases. To protect the environment, beaches along the Atlantic Ocean in Pointe-Noire have been cleaned up and local trees have been planted in order to combat global warming in Bouenza. Contribution of the organization to the work of the United Nations Cognizant of the fact that no modern human activity can be outside the purview of the Sustainable Development Goals and be considered civic-minded, our organization has been focused on the following Goals: Goal 1. We work with young mothers to eliminate poverty in all its forms around us and in our local communities. Goal 2. We strive to eliminate hunger in order to ensure food security, improve nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture. Goal 3. We work to give these young women the means to live healthy lives. Goal 5. We work towards gender equality and the empowerment of young girls and mothers. Goal 13. We take urgent action to combat climate change and its repercussions through awareness-raising campaigns at all levels, including the local level, and through participation in international meetings and petitions. Goal 14. We strive to achieve a healthy, clean sea by cleaning up beaches. Goal 15. We work to preserve and restore the Earth\u2019s ecosystems, hence the importance of planting trees to ensure our future and that of insects, animals and everything else around us.

      "text": "Security Council Distr.: General 12 March 2025 Original: English 25-03537 (E) 240325 *2503537* Implementation of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) during the period from 21 October 2024 to 20 February 2025 Report of the Secretary-General I. Introduction 1. The present report provides a comprehensive assessment of the implementation of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) since the previous report issued on 13 November 2024 (S/2024/817). Intense exchanges of fire between Hizbullah and the Israel Defense Forces continued, in violation of resolution 1701 (2006), causing casualties, displacement and destruction on both sides of the Blue Line, until a cessation of hostilities came into effect on 27 November 2024. As announced by the United States of America and France on 26 November, the commitments related to a cessation of hostilities included that, within a 60-day period, \u201cIsrael will withdraw its forces in a phased manner south of the Blue Line, and in parallel the LAF [Lebanese Armed Forces] will deploy to positions in the Southern Litani Area\u201d and will dismantle \u201cunauthorized sites and infrastructure\u201d and confiscate \u201cunauthorized arms and related materiel\u201d. The Israel Defense Forces subsequently commenced withdrawal from Lebanese territory and the Lebanese Armed Forces started to redeploy south of the Litani River. On 26 January, the United States announced that \u201cthe arrangement between Lebanon and Israel, monitored by the United States, will continue to be in effect until February 18, 2025\u201d. As at 18 February, the Israel Defense Forces remained present in five positions north of the Blue Line. While the level of violence decreased dramatically after 27 November, the continued presence of the Israel Defense Forces north of the Blue Line, the continuing deployment of the Lebanese Armed Forces south of the Litani River, as well as the large quantities of unauthorized assets and weapons uncovered there, underscore the need for the parties to take urgent steps to consolidate the cessation of hostilities and fully implement resolution 1701 (2006). II. Implementation of resolution 1701 (2006) A. Situation in the area of operations of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon 2. From 21 October to 26 November, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) recorded 2,182 trajectories of projectiles fired from within the area of S/2025/153 25-03537 2/32 operations to south of the Blue Line and 14,172 from south to north of the Blue Line, as well as 633 air attacks by the Israel Defense Forces. The highest number of trajectories, 1,527, was detected on 24 October, with 83 from north and 1,443 from south of the Blue Line. Each trajectory can represent multiple projectiles. Almost all projectiles were rockets, mortar bombs and artillery shells. UNIFIL radars cannot detect some types of projectiles, such as air-to-surface missiles, tank rounds, portable anti-tank missiles or projectiles fired from light weapons. Figure I Daily trajectories of projectiles detected by the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, October to November 2024 Source: UNIFIL. 3. UNIFIL observed daily military activities by the Israel Defense Forces north of the Blue Line, shifting to large-scale demolition of what Israel stated was Hizbullah infrastructure after 27 November. From 21 October to 27 November, the Israel Defense Forces killed several senior Hizbullah military figures in Lebanon, including in the UNIFIL area of operations. Daily clashes between Hizbullah and the Israel Defense Forces inside the UNIFIL area of operations continued until the morning of 27 November. Residential areas, civilian infrastructure and agricultural land in southern Lebanon were extensively damaged or destroyed by Israeli operations. 4. In late October, UNIFIL observed incursions by the Israel Defense Forces into villages just north of the Blue Line in both Sectors East and West. Subsequently, the Israel Defense Forces were observed further north near Khiyam (Sector East) and Bint Jubayl (Sector West). In November, Israeli strikes and ground clashes with Hizbullah escalated around Shama and Bayyadah in Sector West and Khiyam. Shama and Bayyadah marked the deepest ground presence of the Israel Defense Forces in Lebanon since 1 October 2024 (see S/2024/817, paras. 16\u201317). 5. Until 27 November, UNIFIL operational and logistical movements remained heavily constrained due to kinetic activities. Damaged roads, debris blocking key routes and delays in obtaining necessary deconfliction replies from the Israel Defense Forces were further impediments. From 21 October to 27 November, the mission performed 1,204 operational activities, including 276 vehicle patrols, with the resupply of UNIFIL positions prioritized.",

While continuing operations on Lebanese territory, including in areas they had been unable to reach prior to 27 November, the Israel Defense Forces withdrew from areas in Sector West as well as from some areas in Sector East, including Khiyam, by 26 January. 16. Until 18 February, the Israel Defense Forces issued repeated warnings to the Lebanese population against entering approximately 60 villages, mostly within 5 to 7 km of the Blue Line, in southern Lebanon. UNIFIL observed white barrels installed by the Israel Defense Forces north of the Blue Line with warnings affixed in Arabic advising people not to pass, near Arab al-Luwayzah, Sarda and between Markaba and Hula (all Sector East). In February, the Israel Defense Forces blocked access from north of the Blue Line to Shaykh Abbad\u2019s tomb in Hula. 17. On 2 January, the Israel Defense Forces conducted strikes in the Jazzin and Nabatiyah districts, stating that the Lebanese Armed Forces had failed to respond to their request to neutralize an identified Hizbullah threat. Israeli air strikes on 28 January against \u201ca Hezbollah truck and an additional vehicle that transferred weapons\u201d in Nabatiyah injured 24 people. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Number of trajectories South to north North to south S/2025/153 7/32 25-03537 18. The Lebanese Armed Forces commenced redeployments south of the Litani River immediately after 27 November, as deconflicted with the cessation of hostilities mechanism (see para. 28 below) and facilitated by UNIFIL. UNIFIL facilitated the deployment of the Lebanese Armed Forces to over 50 positions, including to Khiyam on 10 December and to Alma al-Sha\u2018b, Bayt Lif, Naqurah and Tayr Harfa (all Sector West) in early January, following the withdrawal of the Israel Defense Forces. As at 20 February, the Lebanese Armed Forces had deployed to around 100 positions south of the Litani River, including to re-establish checkpoints, compared with an estimated 10 positions on 27 November. 19. On 24 January, the Government of Israel announced that \u201csince the ceasefire agreement has yet to be fully enforced by the Lebanese state, the gradual withdrawal process will continue, in full coordination with the US\u201d. 20. On 26 January, hundreds of unarmed civilians, some carrying Hizbullah flags, tried to return to their villages through Lebanese Armed Forces checkpoints near villages where the Israel Defense Forces were present along the Blue Line. The Israel Defense Forces fired at the crowd, including with the use of live ammunition. The Ministry of Public Health of Lebanon reported that 24 people, including 6 women and 1 Lebanese Armed Forces soldier, were killed and 134 people wounded. 21. By 18 February, the Israel Defense Forces had withdrawn from population centres in southern Lebanon but retained a presence in five locations along the Blue Line, in the vicinity of Aytarun, Hula, Labbunah, Marwahin and Sarda. Furthermore, they designated two \u201cbuffer zones\u201d in the vicinity of Duhayrah and Kfar Kila. 22. On 19 February, the Lebanese Armed Forces announced that their \u201cmilitary units are continuing their deployment in all southern border towns\u201d but noted that \u201cthe enemy has not fully complied with the withdrawal from the occupied Lebanese territories\u201d. 23. After 27 November, UNIFIL increasingly adjusted its posture, and increased the number of operational activities as the mission\u2019s focus shifted from resupply of United Nations positions to supporting the redeployment of the Lebanes",

After 27 November, UNIFIL increasingly adjusted its posture, and increased the number of operational activities as the mission\u2019s focus shifted from resupply of United Nations positions to supporting the redeployment of the Lebanese Armed Forces in coordination with the withdrawal of the Israel Defense Forces, and the resumption of patrols, where possible. Operational activities rose to a monthly average of 2,123, with approximately 1,100 monthly vehicle patrols, of which over 100 were conducted per month along the Blue Line. The mission conducted 24 air operations after 16 January and 44 foot patrols after 10 January. Nine per cent of UNIFIL operational patrols involved at least one woman peacekeeper. UNIFIL and the Lebanese Armed Forces established permanent checkpoints, including on the main entry routes into the area of operations. The average percentage of UNIFIL operations conducted in close coordination with the Lebanese Armed Forces, among the activities that could be conducted jointly, increased to 49 per cent, compared with 16.8 per cent prior to 23 September (see S/2024/817, para. 26). 24. From 21 October to 20 February, UNIFIL, independently or in close coordination with the Lebanese Armed Forces, discovered 194 weapon caches, consisting mostly of abandoned mobile rocket launching platforms, rockets, mines and ammunition, believed to have belonged to Hizbullah, as well as 6 caches believed to have belonged to the Israel Defense Forces. UNIFIL observed 31 instances of individuals with weapons, including 21 with hunting weapons. The Lebanese Armed Forces also independently uncovered several caches of unauthorized assets and weapons. The Lebanese Armed Forces responded to over 60 per cent of requests from the mechanism established pursuant to the cessation of hostilities (see para. 28), including related to unauthorized weapons and weapons caches north of the \u201ccoordination line\u201d unilaterally set by the Israel Defense Forces prior to their S/2025/153 25-03537 8/32 withdrawal, and to nearly 14 per cent of such findings south of the \u201ccoordination line\u201d that were referred by UNIFIL. Figure V United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon operational activities, October 2024 to February 2025 Source: UNIFIL. 25. On 7 February, UNIFIL submitted to the Lebanese Armed Forces a list of 17 locations of interest, including potential tunnel sites, and inspected 2 of these locations on 20 February. 26. From 21 October to 20 February, UNIFIL started nine technical investigations, including related to impacts on UNIFIL personnel, assets or premises, concluding five. UNIFIL shared the results of the concluded investigations with the parties. 27. All joint training activities between UNIFIL and the Lebanese Armed Forces under the strategic dialogue process remain suspended since 23 September 2024. From 21 October to 20 February, the UNIFIL Maritime Task Force supported maritime interdiction operations, hailing 2,115 vessels. The Lebanese Armed Forces cleared all 430 vessels referred for inspection by UNIFIL. For the first time, the Lebanese Armed Forces invited UNIFIL to join port inspections; UNIFIL joined eight such inspections from 22 January, finding no unauthorized material. B. Security and liaison arrangements 28. The cessation of hostilities agreement provided that the existing tripartite mechanism would be reformulated and enhanced, \u201chosted by UNIFIL, chaired by the United States, and including France, [and] will monitor, verify, and assist in ensuring enforcement of these commitments\u201d of the parties. On 9 and 18 December 2024, 6 and 20 January and 14 February 2025, UNIFIL hosted meetings of the mechanism.

Both parties also recorded their consent concerning UNIFIL sharing information related to violations of resolution 1701 (2006) with the mechanism. On 16 January, the President of the Security Council (S/PRST/2025/1) stated: \u201cThe Security Council calls on the parties to faithfully implement the provisions of the arrangement and for the full implementation of the cessation of hostilities with the support of the United Nations Special Coordinator for Lebanon (UNSCOL) and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), in line with their respective mandates.\u201d On 14 February, the Israel Defense Forces stated that they would maintain positions on Lebanese territory opposite Israeli villages to the south, notwithstanding the UNIFIL offer to establish security arrangements at those positions. UNIFIL has initiated discussions with the parties with respect to the introduction of new technological capabilities to strengthen its monitoring capacities. 29. UNIFIL was in constant contact with the parties to deconflict deployments of the Lebanese Armed Forces, facilitate evacuations and humanitarian access and support de-escalation. UNIFIL coordinated 1,578 civilian or humanitarian activities, including the transportation of medical supplies, the notification of funerals, the repair of civilian infrastructure, the movement of civilians, including journalists, rescue and recovery operations, as well as the clearance of roads. UNIFIL liaised with the Israel Defense Forces 1,454 times on the safety and security of the Lebanese Armed Forces as well as to facilitate their patrols, their redeployment to fixed positions and checkpoints and for explosive ordinance disposal. On 727 occasions, UNIFIL liaised with the parties to ensure force protection and the safety and security of UNIFIL positions and operational activities. UNIFIL supported the Lebanese Red Cross and the International Committee of the Red Cross in the repatriation of seven Lebanese citizens from Israel on 22 December and the return of three Syrian nationals from Israel to Lebanon on 10 January. The UNIFIL liaison function was hampered by limited physical access to the Israel Defense Forces due to the closure of the Rosh Haniqra crossing as well as by the frequent lack of timely responses from the parties. In January, UNIFIL deployed two liaison officers to the Lebanese Armed Forces South Litani Sector headquarters in Tyre. The establishment of a UNIFIL liaison office in Tel Aviv remains pending, despite the agreement of Israel to the proposal made in 2008 for such an office. 30. UNIFIL approved 11 quick-impact projects, 8 of which were in support of crisis response efforts, including in support of the Lebanese Red Cross in Tyre and the provision of food parcels, blankets, hygiene kits and winter clothing. 31. UNIFIL continued to support the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) on women and peace and security, including by providing training on gender mainstreaming for 2,992 UNIFIL military and civilian personnel, of whom 361 were women. C. Disarming armed groups 32. Until 27 November, Hizbullah demonstrated its military capabilities through strikes into Israel, as reported above. Since 27 November, the Lebanese Armed Forces have started to dismantle military infrastructure and to confiscate weapons believed to have belonged to Hizbullah south of the Litani River. The maintenance of arms outside the control of the State by Hizbullah and other non-State groups in violation of resolution 1701 (2006) continues to restrict the State\u2019s ability to exercise full sovereignty and authority over its territory. S/2025/153 25-03537 10/32 33. On 29 October, Hizbullah announced Naim Qassem, the group\u2019s Deputy since 1991, as its new Secretary-General. Mr. Qassem stated on 30 October that \u201cthe blow [to Hizbullah] was painful but we have stood up again, we are cohesive, with big numbers and capabilities\u201d. 34. Hizbullah released video footage on 3 November of an underground tunnel network equipped with a missile launchpad. On 6 November, Mr. Qassem stated: \u201cWe have tens of thousands of trained fighters capable of holding their ground, with the resources to sustain a prolonged confrontation [\u2026] no place within the [Israeli] entity is off limits.",

On 26 November, the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, stated: \u201cA year later [since 8 October 2023], it is not the same Hezbollah. We have pushed them decades back. We eliminated Nasrallah, the axis of the axis. We have taken out the organization\u2019s top leadership, we have destroyed most of their rockets and missiles, we have killed thousands of terrorists and we demolished their underground terror infrastructure abutting our border. [\u2026] The length of the ceasefire depends on what happens in Lebanon. [\u2026] If Hezbollah violates the agreement and tries to arm itself, we will attack. If it tries to rebuild terrorist infrastructure near the border, we will attack. If it launches a rocket, if it digs a tunnel, if it brings in a truck carrying rockets, we will attack.\u201d 36. On 3 December, Mr. Netanyahu stated that \u201cthe current ceasefire with Hizbullah is not tantamount to an end of the war\u201d, vowing that Israel would \u201cenforce the ceasefire with an iron fist and respond decisively to any violation, whether minor or significant\u201d. The same day, the Minister of Defence of Israel, Israel Katz, stated that Lebanon must \u201cauthorize the Lebanese army to enforce their part, to keep Hezbollah away beyond the Litani and to dismantle all the infrastructure\u201d. 37. On 14 December, Mr. Qassem stated: \u201cThis agreement aims at halting the aggression, not dissolving Hizbullah. This agreement is an implementation derived from resolution 1701 and is exclusively applicable to the south of the Litani area. It has nothing to do with Lebanese internal affairs, the relationship between the resistance and the state, the army, the presence of weapons, or any other issues that require dialogue and discussion.\u201d On 18 January, he stated that [Hizbullah\u2019s] \u201cweapons are to be discussed within the defensive strategy, through dialogue\u201d. On 27 January, Mr. Qassem stated that the \u201cviolations of the agreement confirm Lebanon\u2019s need for resistance. Israel is giving the pretext for the resistance\u201d. 38. On 25 December, the Israel Defense Forces stated that \u201c85,000+ weapons, missiles and military items belonging to Hezbollah were confiscated by the IDF in Southern Lebanon\u201d. In identical letters dated 13 January (S/2025/29), the Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations stated: \u201cThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) operation in South Lebanon further exposed [\u2026] the massive military and terror infrastructure that was built in South Lebanon [\u2026] all aimed to attack Israeli civilians, villages and cities. [\u2026] Some encouraging steps have been taken by the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) and the Lebanese government to dismantle some of this illicit military infrastructure of Hezbollah south of the Litani, but unfortunately the pace of action by LAF is insufficient, in the light of the vast military arsenal found\u201d. 39. Four Palestine refugee camps across Lebanon were impacted by targeted Israeli air strikes. On 31 October, the Israel Defense Forces issued an evacuation order for Tyre, including for Rashidieh refugee camp. Air strikes on the El Buss and Rashidieh camps on 21 and 26 November, respectively, resulted in casualties and property damage. Four facilities of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) in Baalbek, Tyre and Beirut were damaged by S/2025/153 11/32 25-03537 nearby air strikes. On 17 February, the Israel Defense Forces stated that they had eliminated a Hamas official in a strike in Sidon. 40. After 27 November, many of the 6,172 displaced persons at 11 UNRWA emergency shelters returned to their areas of residence, while UNRWA resumed its operations in camps south of the Litani River. Due to the continued presence of armed actors, four UNRWA schools in Ein El Hilweh remained inaccessible. 41. On 24 December, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command stated that \u201cthe Front has evacuated all its positions outside the camps in all Lebanese regions \u2026 and handed them over to the Lebanese Army along with the weapons and equipment present there\u201d.

D. Arms embargo and border control 42. Between 24 and 26 November, the Israel Defense Forces struck several official border crossings between Lebanon and the Syrian Arab Republic, stating that they had targeted military infrastructure used by Hizbullah for weapons transfers. Striking border crossings again on 8 and 27 December, the Israel Defense Forces stated that they had targeted structures used for the transport of military equipment to Hizbullah. On 12 and 31 January, Israel struck infrastructure in Janta that it stated was used to manufacture and smuggle weaponry and, on 9 February, a tunnel in the Biqa\u2018 that it stated was used to transport combat equipment from the Syrian Arab Republic into Lebanon. 43. On 12 February, the Israel Defense Forces stated that flights from Tehran to Beirut had been used to \u201csmuggle funds aimed at arming Hezbollah with the objective of carrying out attacks against the State of Israel\u201d, adding that the Israel Defense Forces \u201cwill not allow Hezbollah to arm itself and will act through all means at its disposal to enforce the implementation of the ceasefire understandings in order to ensure the security of the citizens of the State of Israel\u201d. On 13 February, Lebanese authorities suspended flights from Tehran, citing security concerns. 44. The Israel Defense Forces stated on several occasions that it had killed Hizbullah members in air strikes on Syrian territory, including \u201cHezbollah\u2019s representative to the Syrian Military, Salman Nemer Jamaa\u201d on 3 December. On 9 November, Salim Ayyash, who was convicted in absentia for the 2005 assassination of the former Prime Minister of Lebanon, Rafic Hariri (see S/2020/1110, para. 69), was reportedly killed in an air strike in the Syrian Arab Republic. 45. Several clashes between the Lebanese Armed Forces and armed elements from the Syrian Arab Republic near the north-eastern border of Lebanon with the Syrian Arab Republic occurred in December and January. In February, armed clashes between Syrian security forces and Lebanese clans spilled over from the Syrian Arab Republic into north-eastern Lebanon. The Lebanese Armed Forces subsequently announced the \u201cestablishment of observation points, the conduct of patrols, and the establishment of temporary barriers\u201d in response. 46. On 28 December, Lebanese security forces arrested some 70 Syrian former military personnel who had crossed illegally into Lebanon in the Jubayl region and handed them over to the Syrian caretaker authorities. E. Landmines and cluster bombs 47. While routine demining activities remained suspended, UNIFIL dealt with unexploded ordnance and improvised explosive devices on 34 occasions, removing S/2025/153 25-03537 12/32 91 devices, following impacts on UNIFIL positions, to clear roads for UNIFIL patrols and logistics movements and in support of the redeployment of the Lebanese Armed Forces. The Mine Action Service of the United Nations provided 10 explosive ordnance risk awareness sessions for 192 military and civilian personnel and 9 training sessions for the validation of demining teams. F. Delineation of borders 48. While no progress was made towards the delineation or demarcation of the border between Lebanon and the Syrian Arab Republic, the then caretaker Prime Minister of Lebanon, Najib Mikati, announced during his official visit to Damascus on 11 January that there will be a joint Lebanese-Syrian committee to carry out the border demarcation process. The Syrian Arab Republic and Israel have yet to respond to the provisional definition of the Shab\u02bba Farms area proposed in my report of 30 October 2007 on the implementation of resolution 1701 (2006) (S/2007/641, annex).

Following endorsement by the Cabinet of Israel on 26 November, the caretaker Cabinet of Lebanon on 27 November endorsed the announcement of a cessation of hostilities, which Mr. Mikati had welcomed a day earlier as an essential step towards establishing calm and stability in Lebanon and the return of the displaced. 51. Lebanon\u2019s caretaker Cabinet approved on 7 December the deployment plan for the Lebanese Armed Forces south of the Litani River. Earlier, on 6 November, the caretaker Cabinet had approved the allocation of a treasury advance to the Ministry of Defence to finance the enlistment of 1,500 new recruits (see S/2024/817, para. 65). On 14 January, the Lebanese Armed Forces announced that the first group of new recruits had begun training and reaffirmed their recruitment target of 6,000 new personnel. Separately, the Lebanese Armed Forces also finalized their anti-sexual harassment policy and gender strategy. 52. After 26 months of presidential vacuum, the Parliament of Lebanon on 9 January elected the Commander of the Lebanese Armed Forces, Joseph Aoun, as the fourteenth President of Lebanon. Mr. Aoun secured the support of 99 out of 128 parliamentarians in a second voting round. In his inaugural address as President, Mr. Aoun declared \u201ca new phase in the history of Lebanon\u201d and expressed his commitment to \u201censure the state\u2019s right to hold a monopoly on weapons, and to invest in the army to monitor the borders, maintain their security in the south, define the boundaries in the east, north and at sea, prevent smuggling, fight terrorism and preserve the unity of the Lebanese territory\u201d. Mr. Aoun also expressed his commitment \u201cto ask for an integrated defense policy to be debated, as part of a national security strategy on the diplomatic, economic and military levels, to enable the Lebanese state, I repeat, the Lebanese state, to eradicate the Israeli occupation and repel its aggressions on all Lebanese territories\u201d. S/2025/153 13/32 25-03537 53. Major General Hassan Audi, Chief of Staff of the Lebanese Armed Forces, subsequently became Acting Commander of the Lebanese Armed Forces. 54. Following binding consultations with parliamentary blocs, on 13 January the President designated Nawaf Salam, President of the International Court of Justice, as Prime Minister to form a Government. Mr. Salam, who secured the support of 84 of 128 parliamentarians, stated on 14 January that his designation was a \u201ccall to action\u201d to achieve \u201caspirations for change and for building a fair, strong, modern, and civil state\u201d. On 8 February, the President signed the decree forming the Prime Minister \u2019s \u201cGovernment of reform and rescue\u201d. Five of the 24 ministers are women. 55. Following the White House statement on Agreement Extension between Lebanon and Israel of 26 January (see para. 1 above), Mr. Aoun on 7 February stated that \u201cpermanent stability in the South is closely linked to the completion of Israel\u2019s withdrawal from the territories it occupied during the last war, and the full implementation of resolution 1701, including the provisions of the November 27 agreement\u201d. The 26 January announcement further stated: \u201cThe Government of Lebanon, the Government of Israel, and the Government of the United States will also begin negotiations for the return of Lebanese prisoners captured after October 7, 2023.\u201d Following the announcement by Israel that its forces would remain in five positions in southern Lebanon past 18 February, Mr. Aoun, the Speaker, Nabih Berri, and Mr. Salam issued a joint statement calling on the Security Council \u201cto compel Israel to immediately withdraw\u201d and stating the right of Lebanon to use all necessary means to ensure the withdrawal of the Israeli enemy. 56. Protests against the Government\u2019s decision to deny entry to flights from the Islamic Republic of Iran (see para. 43) turned violent. A UNIFIL convoy was attacked by protesters outside Rafic Hariri International Airport, Beirut, on 14 February, resulting in injuries to the Deputy Force Commander and one other peacekeeper (see annex I).* Condemning the attack, Mr. Aoun on 15 February stated: \u201cThe security forces will not be lenient with any party that tries to destabilize and undermine civil peace in the country.",

Protests against the Government\u2019s decision to deny entry to flights from the Islamic Republic of Iran (see para. 43) turned violent.

On 15 February, protesters clashed with the Lebanese Armed Forces outside the airport. 57. The Parliament of Lebanon convened on 28 November to adopt legislation again postponing the retirement of generals in military and security agencies by one year (see S/2024/222, para. 55). 58. On 4 December, the caretaker Cabinet approved $7.9 million for assistance, including medical treatment, to those in need in South Lebanon. On 17 December, it approved funding for reconstruction efforts, including approximately $10 million each for the South and the southern suburbs of Beirut. 59. The Ministry of Public Health of Lebanon stated that, as at 13 February 2025, over 4,244 people had been killed, including 341 children and 962 women, and 17,506 injured, due to the hostilities since 8 October 2023. More than 55 Lebanese civilians have been killed by Israeli military operations since 27 November 2024, including at least nine women and seven children. 60. With more than 90,000 housing units damaged or destroyed, extensive damage to civilian infrastructure and the presence of explosive ordnance, many of those displaced during the hostilities faced significant obstacles upon returning home, especially to villages near the Blue Line. As at 19 February, 98,994 people remained displaced, while 950,652 people had begun returning to their areas of origin. __________________ * Circulated in the language of submission only. S/2025/153 25-03537 14/32 61. At least 160 healthcare facilities were impacted by air strikes and 241 health workers killed and 295 injured while on duty from 8 October 2023 to 20 February 2025. As at 20 February, three hospitals and 26 primary healthcare centres remained closed. At least 45 water facilities were damaged, impacting nearly 500,000 people. An estimated 1.65 million people faced high levels of acute food insecurity. In addition, at least 14 public schools were destroyed and 105 were heavily damaged since 8 October 2023. 62. The Lebanon flash appeal, calling for $425.7 million to meet the needs of 1 million vulnerable people from 1 October to 31 December, was extended until March 2025, with an additional $371.4 million requested. As at 31 December, the 2024 appeal was 71 per cent funded, with $304 million mobilized. The 2024 appeal for the Lebanon Response Plan was 49 per cent funded at $1.32 billion out of $2.72 billion requested. On 24 October, the President of France, Emmanuel Macron, hosted an International Conference in Support of Lebanon\u2019s People and Sovereignty to mobilize humanitarian assistance and support for the Lebanese Armed Forces. 63. In identical letters dated 17 December addressed to the President of the Security Council and to the Secretary-General (A/79/703-S/2024/933), the Charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of Lebanon to the United Nations stated that \u201cthe country has been left facing significant economic challenges owing to the destruction of farmland and crops, the death of livestock and the destruction of infrastructure\u201d. In a letter conveyed as an annex to identical letters dated 6 November addressed to the Security Council and to the Secretary-General (A/79/671-S/2024/806), the caretaker Prime Minister, Najib Mikati, stated that \u201cthe ongoing Israeli aggression, particularly the attacks on cities like Baalbek and Tyre, has resulted in the displacement of entire populations and the destruction of invaluable cultural heritage sites\u201d. 64. On 7 February, Judge Tarek Bitar resumed his investigation into the Beirut port explosion of 4 August 2020, summoning officials for questioning from the Customs Directorate, the General Security Directorate, the Lebanese Armed Forces Intelligence and the Beirut Port Administration. 65. As at 31 January, 763,707 refugees and asylum-seekers were registered with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Lebanon, including 752,675 Syrian refugees and 11,032 refugees and asylum-seekers of other nationalities.",

As at 31 January, 763,707 refugees and asylum-seekers were registered with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Lebanon, including 752,675 Syrian refugees and 11,032 refugees and asylum-seekers of other nationalities. With new registrations of Syrian refugees by UNHCR suspended by the Government of Lebanon since 2015, the actual number of refugees remains unknown, but is estimated at 1.5 million by the Government. 66. An estimated 540,000 people (63 per cent Syrian and 37 per cent Lebanese) seeking protection crossed from Lebanon to the Syrian Arab Republic between 3 October 2023 and 27 November 2024. The majority returned to Lebanon after 27 November. After 8 December, an estimated 95,500 Lebanese and Syrian nationals entered Lebanon from the Syrian Arab Republic, while at least 112,700 exited Lebanon to the Syrian Arab Republic. Since 1 January 2025, UNHCR recorded 120 deportation incidents by Lebanese authorities affecting at least 5,303 Syrian nationals. III. Security and safety measures 67. The designated officials north and south of the Litani River continued to coordinate to ensure the safety and security of all United Nations personnel in Lebanon. From 27 November, some programme-critical personnel were permitted to return to south of the Litani River, with additional safety measures in place. S/2025/153 15/32 25-03537 Restrictions on non-programme critical United Nations civilian personnel north of the Litani River (see S/2024/817, para. 71) were lifted from 1 February. 68. From 21 October to 20 February, UNIFIL registered at least 39 instances of impacts on United Nations positions and vehicles, including 10 after 27 November (see annex I). Most affected were Naqurah headquarters, Sector West headquarters and a position near Kfar Shuba (Sector East). From 21 October to 20 February, UNIFIL positions or vehicles came under fire leading to injuries to 25 peacekeepers, including 3 after 27 November. UNIFIL peacekeepers were also fired upon by small arms on several occasions, without any casualties. On 7 November, the Israel Defense Forces damaged a UNIFIL position near Naqurah and removed four blue barrels from near Mays al-Jabal, Hula, Yarun and Labbunah. 69. All UNIFIL positions remained staffed throughout the reporting period. The mission\u2019s freedom of movement was restricted, however, including due to Israel Defense Forces advisories for peacekeepers to remain at level 2, in base, or level 3, in shelter, for their own safety. The exception was two battalions in the northern part of Sector West, which returned partly to level 1, normal activity after 27 November (see annex I). 70. The next trial hearing in the case of the fatal attack against UNIFIL near Mazra\u2018at al-Aqibiyah on 14 December 2022, which had been scheduled for 12 February 2025, was postponed again, to 17 September 2025. The United Nations still has not been informed of any criminal proceedings to bring to justice the perpetrators of the incident of 4 August 2018 in Majdal Zun (Sector West). Investigations into the acts of aggression against UNIFIL peacekeepers in Shaqra on 22 December 2021, in Bint Jubayl on 4 January 2022 and in Ramiyah on 25 January 2022 continued. IV. Deployment of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon 71. As at 20 February, UNIFIL had 10,280 military personnel, including 891 women (8.7 per cent), from 48 troop-contributing countries, and 782 civilian staff (238 international and 544 national), including 254 women (32.5 per cent). The UNIFIL Maritime Task Force consisted of five vessels, with 620 of the mission\u2019s military personnel, including 54 women (8.7 per cent). In addition, 43 military observers, including 9 women (21 per cent), from the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization served with Observer Group Lebanon under the operational command of UNIFIL. The most senior military woman had the rank of colonel, while the most senior civilian woman served at the D-2 level. 72. The mission is working with United Nations Headquarters and troop- contributing countries to rapidly deploy strengthened capacities in the areas of mine clearance, unexploded ordnance disposal and engineering to clear roads and facilitate a return to full patrolling and monitoring functions across the area of operations. Two explosive ordnance reconnaissance teams and four explosive ordnance disposal teams have been deployed since 27 November. 73.",

      "text": "vel. 72. The mission is working with United Nations Headquarters and troop- contributing countries to rapidly deploy strengthened capacities in the areas of mine clearance, unexploded ordnance disposal and engineering to clear roads and facilitate a return to full patrolling and monitoring functions across the area of operations. Two explosive ordnance reconnaissance teams and four explosive ordnance disposal teams have been deployed since 27 November. 73. UNIFIL continued to issue statements, give interviews and conduct in-person and virtual media visits to clarify its mandate and activities and counter mis- and disinformation. Following the Israeli naval raid at Batrun (see para. 9), UNIFIL issued a statement refuting false media allegations that the mission was involved in the incident. 74. UNIFIL continued to implement the Comprehensive Planning and Performance Assessment System and to assess the continued relevance of UNIFIL resources (see S/2025/153 25-03537 16/32 S/2020/473), pursuant to Security Council resolution 2539 (2020). The mission also utilized indicators from the Action for Peacekeeping Plus monitoring framework to enhance its data-driven analysis and reporting. UNIFIL conducted 15 evaluations of units for preparedness, in implementation of the Action for Peacekeeping commitments and Security Council resolution 2436 (2018). No major shortfalls were identified. V. Conduct and discipline 75. From 1 October to 30 January, UNIFIL recorded seven allegations of possible unsatisfactory conduct, without any allegation of sexual exploitation and abuse. Induction training on United Nations standards of conduct was delivered to 1 civilian and 2,601 military personnel. Self-study modules on the prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse and the prevention of sexual harassment were provided to 728 civilian and 217 military personnel. VI. Observations 76. I welcome that the cessation of hostilities has continued to hold since 27 November, despite challenges, with progress made towards the withdrawal of the Israel Defense Forces from Lebanese territory concomitant with the strengthened deployment of the Lebanese Armed Forces south of the Litani River. The restoration of a cessation of hostilities has brought significant relief to communities on both sides of the Blue Line who endured profound violence, destruction and suffering over the past year. This relief must not be fleeting. During my visit to Lebanon in January, an atmosphere of opportunity and hope was palpable. A long-awaited opportunity exists to deliver the enduring security and stability that the people of Lebanon and Israel deserve and that will enable those displaced on both sides to return home and rebuild their lives. 77. The situation remains fragile, however. The Israel Defense Forces have not yet completely withdrawn from Lebanese territory, remaining at five locations, and designating two areas as \u201cbuffer zones\u201d along the Blue Line. The Lebanese Armed Forces continue to deploy throughout southern Lebanon, with the active support of UNIFIL, while displaced communities also return to their homes. The Lebanese Armed Forces also continue to dispose of large quantities of abandoned weapons believed to have belonged to Hizbullah. I call on all concerned actors to refrain from unilateral or provocative actions that could undermine the cessation of hostilities. The parties are urged to fully respect and swiftly implement their commitments, including respect for the Blue Line, and to build on this political momentum towards the full implementation of resolution 1701 (2006) and its ultimate goal, a permanent ceasefire between Lebanon and Israel. I welcome the coordination between UNIFIL, the parties, and the mechanism established pursuant to the cessation of hostilities. I reiterate that the United Nations stands ready to support arrangements that can strengthen confidence in communities to return home on both sides of the Blue Line. 78. It is in the interest of both parties that the Lebanese Armed Forces be able to reassert and consolidate their authority and that of the Lebanese State throughout its territory, including to ensure that the area between the Litani River and the Blue Line is free of all armed personnel, assets and weapons outside the authority of the State, in line with the cessation of hostilities agreement and resolution 1701 (2006). I regret that the Lebanese Armed Forces suffered casualties despite refraining from the hostilities. The strengthened presence and capability of the Lebanese Armed Forces is at the core of resolution 1701 (2006).",

I regret that the Lebanese Armed Forces suffered casualties despite refraining from the hostilities. The strengthened presence and capability of the Lebanese Armed Forces is at the core of resolution 1701 (2006). I extend my appreciation to Member States S/2025/153 17/32 25-03537 for their support provided to date and call on donors to bolster their material and financial support commensurate with their commitment to the full implementation of resolution 1701 (2006). 79. At the same time, the Israel Defense Forces must complete their withdrawal from Lebanese territory. The presence of the Israel Defense Forces north of the Blue Line is a violation of Lebanese sovereignty and territorial integrity and resolution 1701 (2006), and undermines the efforts of the Lebanese authorities to extend State authority throughout all of its territory. I reiterate my condemnation of all violations of Lebanese sovereignty from Israel and call again for the Government of Israel to cease all overflights of Lebanese territory. I also condemn any violation of the sovereignty of Israel from Lebanon. 80. The continued occupation by the Israel Defense Forces of northern Ghajar and the adjacent area north of the Blue Line is also in violation of resolution 1701 (2006) and must cease. I again urge the Israeli authorities to fulfil their obligations under resolution 1701 (2006) to withdraw from northern Ghajar and the adjacent area north of the Blue Line. I note that the Government of Lebanon has welcomed the UNIFIL proposal of 2011 for the facilitation of the withdrawal of the Israel Defense Forces from the occupied area, while the Government of Israel has yet to respond. 81. I welcome the election of a President of Lebanon, the designation of a Prime Minister and the subsequent swift formation of a new Government. The United Nations looks forward to working in close partnership with the new President and Prime Minister and the new Government on its priorities, including the consolidation of the cessation of hostilities and the full implementation of resolution 1701 (2006), while supporting all efforts to address the pressing needs and aspirations of the population of Lebanon, including through humanitarian response, recovery and reconstruction and by advancing a comprehensive, inclusive and sustainable reform agenda. 82. The massive devastation caused by the hostilities will require a comprehensive and inclusive recovery and reconstruction process. Even as the cessation of hostilities has enabled the return of most of those displaced to their areas of origin, many others are unable to return, with civilian infrastructure and homes destroyed, essential services disrupted, the continued presence of explosive ordnance and limited livelihood opportunities. I call on donors to fully fund the 2025 Lebanon Response Plan and the flash appeal to address continuing humanitarian needs and support the recovery, reconstruction and stabilization of Lebanon, which is also critical to extending the authority of the Lebanese State throughout its territory. An empowered Government capable of delivering on long-overdue reforms to restore international confidence and unlock donor funding will be critical. Towards this end, I welcome the commitments of the President, Joseph Aoun, and the Prime Minister, Nawaf Salam, to advance comprehensive economic and governance reforms, including with respect to the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law. 83. I am also encouraged by Mr. Aoun\u2019s pledge to ensure that the Lebanese State has a monopoly over all weapons throughout its territory and to convene a dialogue towards elaboration of a national security strategy. The exchanges of fire demonstrated the possession of weapons outside the authority of the State in the area between the Litani River and the Blue Line by Hizbullah and other non-State armed groups in violation of resolutions 1701 (2006) and 1559 (2004). I call upon the Government of Lebanon to facilitate the full implementation of the relevant provisions of the Taif Accords and of resolutions 1559 (2004), 1701 (2006) and 1680 (2006), which require the disarmament of all armed groups in Lebanon and the extension of the control of the Government of Lebanon over all Lebanese territory. Proactive steps taken by the Lebanese Armed Forces towards the dismantling of the S/2025/153 25-03537 18/32 bases of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command and Fatah al-Intifada are notable in this regard. 84.",

To support the parties in upholding their commitments in a new operating environment, UNIFIL is adapting its posture. In this regard, I welcome the support of troop-contributing countries that are working with the mission to rapidly strengthen its capacities to facilitate a return to full patrolling and monitoring functions across the area of operations. The comprehensive resumption of UNIFIL mandated activities requires that there be no restrictions imposed by either party, including with respect to the mission\u2019s freedom of movement and access to all locations of interest and all parts of the Blue Line, as required under resolution 1701 (2006). In addition, UNIFIL is planning to introduce new technologies to improve monitoring and verification; enhance tactical responsiveness; and reassess operational frameworks with the Lebanese Armed Forces and the Israel Defense Forces. Acceptance by the parties of these adaptations will be a testament to their commitment to upholding their obligations under the resolution. Furthermore, the essential partnership between UNIFIL and the Lebanese Armed Forces must continue to become more effective, including through joint operational planning, to support the implementation of resolution 1701 (2006). 85. I reiterate my call on both parties to comply with their obligations under international law, including international humanitarian law, and ensure the safety and security of United Nations personnel, their freedom of movement and the absolute inviolability of United Nations premises and property at all times. I strongly condemn the attack on a UNIFIL convoy near the airport on 14 February in which several peacekeepers were injured. Perpetrators of attacks against UNIFIL must be held to account. 86. I reiterate my call upon Israel and the Syrian Arab Republic to submit their responses to the provisional definition of the Shab\u02bba Farms area as provided in the report of the Secretary-General dated 30 October 2007 (S/2007/641). 87. Developments in the Syrian Arab Republic also offer hope for the eventual safe, voluntary and dignified return of Syrian refugees. I call on the international community to work with the Syrian caretaker authorities towards creating conditions conducive to such returns. The consistent application of legal and procedural safeguards, including the principle of non-refoulement, remains essential. 88. I reiterate my appeal to support the work of UNRWA and for donors to increase their financial support to ensure the continuity of essential services and support by UNRWA to all Palestine refugees in Lebanon. 89. I welcome resumption of the judicial investigation into the Beirut port explosion on 4 August 2020, as well as the stated commitment of the Prime Minister, Mr. Salam, to ensure justice for the victims of the explosion and their families. 90. Lastly, as I conveyed during my visit to Lebanon, I express my deep admiration and appreciation for our peacekeepers, who stayed in position and stood with courage and dedication despite the persistent danger. They in no small part contributed to the return to a cessation of hostilities becoming possible, and their continued efforts, in implementation of their mandate under resolution 1701 (2006), will be vital in supporting the parties in upholding their obligations under the cessation of hostilities and resolution 1701 (2006). I express my sincere gratitude to all countries contributing military personnel and equipment to UNIFIL and Observer Group Lebanon. I thank the Special Coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, the UNIFIL Head of Mission and Force Commander, Lieutenant General Aroldo L\u00e1zaro S\u00e1enz, as well as the troop-contributing countries that remained united in this difficult period, and all members of the United Nations country team for their continued dedication to peace and stability.

It called upon the Government of Lebanon to facilitate prompt and full access to sites requested by UNIFIL for the purpose of swift investigation, including all locations of interest, all relevant locations north of the Blue Line related to the discovery of tunnels crossing the Blue Line (as reported in S/2019/237) and unauthorized firing ranges, in line with resolution 1701 (2006), while respecting Lebanese sovereignty. 2. From 21 October to 26 November, normal operational and logistical activities outside UNIFIL positions were suspended throughout the area of operations. Only essential logistics movements to resupply UNIFIL positions with food, water and fuel were conducted during this period. The prolonged periods of time that UNIFIL peacekeepers spent in shelter following security advisories from the Israel Defense Forces, stated by the latter to be necessary for the safety and security of UNIFIL personnel, further impeded mandated activities. Between 16 and 18 November, for instance, some positions were in bunkers for a continuous 57 hours. 3. From 27 November to 26 January, UNIFIL conducted 1,632 patrols. Of these, an average of 70 independent vehicle patrols were conducted each month along the Blue Line, out of an overall monthly average of 810 vehicle patrols, conducted during the day and at night. Some foot patrols resumed in January in Sector East, while market walks remained suspended. Air operations, including image collection, also resumed in January. In addition, the mission conducted an average of 412 inspection activities each month, which included the operation of permanent checkpoints and the conduct of counter-rocket-launching patrols. 4. From 27 January to 20 February, operational activities continued to increase, with UNIFIL conducting 3,496 operational activities, including 1,706 patrols. Of the patrols, 160 independent vehicle patrols were conducted along the Blue Line, during both the day and at night. In addition, the mission conducted 1,376 inspection activities, which included the operation of permanent and temporary checkpoints as well as the conduct of counter-rocket-launching patrols. 5. During the conduct of ground operations by the Israel Defense Forces north of the Blue Line, Israel Defense Forces personnel and infrastructure were on occasion situated directly next to United Nations positions. In several instances, UNIFIL positions were damaged as a result of exchanges of fire between the Israel Defense Forces and Hizbullah. Blue Line barrels, marking the Blue Line, were removed or damaged on four occasions by the Israel Defense Forces in Mays al-Jabal, Hula, Labbunah and Rumaysh. 6. During the reporting period, UNIFIL observed white barrels placed by the Israel Defense Forces north of the Blue Line, near Arab al-Luwayzah, Sarda, and between Markaba and Hula (all Sector East). A warning sign reading, in Arabic, \u201cbeware, your life is in danger, passing prohibited\u201d was seen on some of the barrels. UNIFIL movement beyond those white barrels was thus restricted. In addition, the movements of UNIFIL patrols continued to be impeded on several occasions due to IDF checkpoints and roadblocks that were either human-made or caused by debris or the cratering of roads in air strikes. S/2025/153 25-03537 20/32 7. UNIFIL has consistently followed up on reported incidents of restrictions of movement with both Lebanese and Israeli authorities. While the freedom of movement of UNIFIL was respected in most cases, the mission continued to experience restrictions, as detailed below. In addition, between 21 October and 20 February, UNIFIL access was restricted by the Israel Defense Forces on at least 16 occasions and by population gatherings on 12 occasions, in various locations within the mission\u2019s area of operations. In most cases, patrols resumed on alternative routes. Access to all locations of interest 8. Owing to the security situation during the reporting period, UNIFIL was not able to systematically monitor locations of interest, including Green without Borders sites. Many of these sites were destroyed or damaged by the Israel Defense Forces.",

In most cases, patrols resumed on alternative routes. Access to all locations of interest 8. Owing to the security situation during the reporting period, UNIFIL was not able to systematically monitor locations of interest, including Green without Borders sites. Many of these sites were destroyed or damaged by the Israel Defense Forces. UNIFIL continues to request unrestricted access to the entire area of operations. On 7 February, UNIFIL communicated a list detailing 17 locations of interest to the Lebanese Armed Forces and requested coordinated inspections of these locations. UNIFIL visited two of these locations independently on 20 February. A series of tunnel openings was discovered by UNIFIL patrols on 19 February. UNIFIL communicated the coordinates to the Lebanese Armed Forces and they inspected the sites the next day. Freedom of movement incidents 9. On 21 October, Israel Defense Forces soldiers with two tanks blocked the movement of a UNIFIL logistical convoy on a road near Rumaysh (Sector West), with the soldiers stating that UNIFIL could not proceed as there was armed activity in the area. As the patrol was not able to use an alternative route, the activity was cancelled and the peacekeepers returned to their position. 10. On 23 October, a UNIFIL team conducting a medical evacuation encountered rubble blocking a road south-west of Yarin (Sector West). As the patrol could not proceed, an additional team from another UNIFIL position was dispatched to retrieve the patient. As the first UNIFIL team was waiting for the second team to arrive, it was caught in crossfire of unknown origin. The team was forced to withdraw, together with the patient, to a UNIFIL position. A few minutes later, the second team arrived at the location and was also caught in the crossfire. The second team also withdrew, but one of the vehicles was damaged by the gunfire and had to be left at the scene. An internal UNIFIL investigation concluded that the firing was probably not deliberately targeting the peacekeepers\u2019 vehicles. 11. Also on 23 October, Israel Defense Forces soldiers stopped a UNIFIL logistics convoy in the vicinity of Hula (Sector East) and questioned the peacekeepers about the convoys\u2019 route, the number of peacekeepers and the movement order, while a second Israel Defense Forces soldier filmed the convoy. The Israel Defense Forces told the peacekeepers that the area was not safe and requested the UNIFIL convoy to return to its position. On its way back, the UNIFIL convoy was stopped by two Israel Defense Forces bulldozers placing trees, debris and rocks on the road, impeding the movement of the convoy. The convoy continued its movement on an alternative route. UNIFIL protested the incidents to the Israel Defense Forces, which said that the movement had not been coordinated in advance and had to be stopped as the convoy was approaching an active combat zone. UNIFIL has launched an internal investigation into the incident. 12. On 1 November, 15 Israel Defense Forces soldiers stopped a UNIFIL patrol on the way back to its position north of Mays al-Jabal (Sector East). The patrol was returning from having cleared debris and unexploded ordnance near Hula. The Israeli S/2025/153 21/32 25-03537 soldiers instructed the patrol to move back to the nearest UNIFIL position. The patrol diverted from its planned itinerary and continued to a nearby observation post. 13. On 3 November, 10 armed individuals on scooters encircled a UNIFIL patrol south-east of Burj al Qibli (Sector West) and looked into the UNIFIL vehicles. UNIFIL contacted the Lebanese Armed Forces, which reached the location shortly thereafter. An additional Lebanese Armed Forces team arrived at the location approximately an hour later and spoke with the individuals, following which the individuals left the area. The Lebanese Armed Forces accompanied the UNIFIL patrol out of the area, whereafter the patrol resumed its planned itinerary. In official correspondence, the Lebanese Armed Forces informed UNIFIL that the patrol had been stopped as it had conducted some road works that had raised suspicion among the local residents. 14. On 6 November, a stone was thrown towards a UNIFIL logistical convoy near the Sidon-Tyre highway (outside the area of operations). The convoy continued its planned itinerary without interruption. One UNIFIL vehicle sustained minor damage to a door. 15.",

One UNIFIL vehicle sustained minor damage to a door. 15. On 7 November, five UNIFIL peacekeepers conducting a logistics movement on the Beirut-Sidon highway (outside the area of operations) were injured following an Israel Defense Forces drone strike on a vehicle that was in close proximity to the UNIFIL convoy. The windows and windshields of two UNIFIL vehicles were also damaged. UNIFIL protested the incident to the Israel Defense Forces, which erroneously stated that the movement had not been coordinated in advance. 16. On 14 November, south-west of Qallawiyah (Sector West), a UNIFIL patrol was subject to direct fire. The shots came from an approximate distance of 75 m. The peacekeepers responded by firing warning shots into the air, whereafter they continued to a nearby UNIFIL position. There were no injuries to UNIFIL personnel or damage to vehicles. The Lebanese Armed Forces were informed of the incident and responded that access to narrow roads in neighbourhoods and to private properties and the inspection of locations without prior coordination with the Lebanese Armed Forces were not in keeping with national laws. UNIFIL has launched an investigation into the incident. 17. On 16 November, a UNIFIL patrol observed an abandoned rocket launcher near Hallusiyat al Tahta (Sector East). Shortly thereafter, five individuals, at least one of whom was armed with a rifle, attempted to block the patrol on a road in the vicinity of Bidyas and Maarakeh (Sector East), but the patrol was able to bypass the individuals and continued its movement. An hour later, as the patrol passed Maarakeh (Sector East), three individuals fired approximately 40 times towards the rear vehicle of the patrol. Two UNIFIL vehicles were damaged by bullets. There were no injuries to UNIFIL personnel. UNIFIL has launched an internal investigation into the incident. The mayor of Bidyas informed UNIFIL that he had engaged with the youths involved in the incidents and expressed his disapproval of actions interfering with UNIFIL patrols. 18. On 19 November, two unknown individuals in a building opened fire at a UNIFIL patrol near Khirbat Silm (Sector East), prompting the patrol to fire warning shots. The patrol then continued to its position south-east of Haddatha (Sector West) approximately 30 minutes later. Due to the rapid manoeuvring and the firing of warning shots from inside the patrol vehicle, one peacekeeper sustained acoustic trauma and light bruising on his leg. A second peacekeeper reported pain under his right eye. There was no damage to the UNIFIL vehicles. UNIFIL liaised with the local municipal authorities, which described the incident as an act of mistrust against UNIFIL troops amid ongoing hostilities. S/2025/153 25-03537 22/32 19. On 19 November, armed individuals who identified themselves as Hizbullah members stopped a UNIFIL vehicle on the Damascus highway in Beirut (outside the area of operations). The peacekeepers were told to refrain from using any electronic equipment. The armed individuals took the peacekeepers\u2019 UNIFIL identification cards. One of the armed individuals forcibly entered the UNIFIL vehicle and drove it to what appeared to be an unofficial checkpoint. At the checkpoint, the identification cards were returned, and another driver took over and drove to nearby Lebanese Armed Forces barracks. The peacekeepers had remained in their vehicle throughout. Subsequently, the Lebanese Armed Forces accompanied the patrol to UNIFIL House in Beirut. UNIFIL protested the incident to the Lebanese Armed Forces and has launched an internal investigation into the incident. 20. On 21 November, approximately 20 individuals surrounded a UNIFIL convoy in the southern suburbs of Beirut (outside the area of operations). The convoy had to divert from the main road due to a roadblock, and while trying to exit the area, the individuals started to fire shots in the air and subsequently also directly at the UNIFIL vehicles. The convoy managed to move out of the area while being pursued by individuals on scooters and in vehicles. Both UNIFIL vehicles were damaged, one with bullet holes. UNIFIL has launched an investigation into the incident. 21. On 27 November, a crowd of 12 individuals blocked a UNIFIL logistical convoy on a road north-west of Mays al-Jabal (Sector East) by placing vehicles across the road.",

UNIFIL has launched an investigation into the incident. 21. On 27 November, a crowd of 12 individuals blocked a UNIFIL logistical convoy on a road north-west of Mays al-Jabal (Sector East) by placing vehicles across the road. Peacekeepers asked the individuals to allow them to pass, but the crowd refused. The peacekeepers cancelled their activity and returned to their position. The local civil defence informed UNIFIL that the incident was not directed against the mission but was a show of general discontent from residents at not being allowed to enter their village. 22. On 27 November, a UNIFIL patrol was told to wait by Lebanese Armed Forces soldiers in the vicinity of Kfar Kila (Sector East). After waiting for about 10 minutes, the patrol continued its movement. A few minutes later, the patrol observed two Israel Defense Forces tanks, with a soldier on one of the tanks signalling that the patrol could continue. The patrol therefore proceeded but encountered debris blocking the road. While the peacekeepers tried to clear the road, eight Israel Defense Forces soldiers approached the peacekeepers and said that the patrol had to turn back. The peacekeepers cancelled the activity and returned to their position. 23. On 29 November, approximately 30 individuals in civilian clothes blocked a UNIFIL patrol north-east of Naffakhiyah (Sector West). The individuals were neither armed nor aggressive but did not let the patrol continue towards the village centre. As the peacekeepers were not able to continue, they cancelled the patrol and returned to their position. 24. On 30 November, nine Israel Defense Forces soldiers with four vehicles blocked a UNIFIL patrol north-east of Jubbayn (Sector West) and told the peacekeepers they could not pass. The patrol returned to its position. Later the same day, the patrol resumed the activity without restriction. 25. On 1 December, Israel Defense Forces soldiers with two tanks stopped a UNIFIL patrol south-west of Zallutiyah (Sector West) and instructed the peacekeepers to return to their position. The peacekeepers cancelled the activity and returned to their position. 26. On 3 December, a UNIFIL patrol observed a cache of rockets on the side of the road, south-east of Udaysah (Sector East). As the patrol continued its movement, two individuals in civilian clothes and armed with a machine gun and a rifle fired at the patrol. The patrol fired back in the direction of the assailants and accelerated to leave the area. The patrol activity was subsequently cancelled, with the peacekeepers S/2025/153 23/32 25-03537 returning to their position. No damage or injury was detected. The Lebanese Armed Forces were informed. UNIFIL has launched an internal investigation into the incident. 27. On 4 December, 10 individuals, one of whom had a concealed gun, stopped a UNIFIL patrol north-west of Suwwanan (Sector East). The peacekeepers reversed and used an alternative route to return to their position. 28. On 5 December, Israel Defense Forces soldiers stopped a UNIFIL patrol near Sarda (Sector East) and requested the patrol to turn back. The patrol returned to its position. 29. On 10 December, after having encountered Israel Defense Forces soldiers and an infantry vehicle, 10 (warning) shots of unknown origin were fired, impacting approximately 100 m ahead of a UNIFIL patrol west of Yarun (Sector West). The patrol continued its activity, using an alternative route. 30. On 16 December, 12 Israel Defense Forces soldiers blocked a UNIFIL patrol south-east of Yarin (Sector West) and asked the peacekeepers to turn back. The patrol, which was escorting a truck with gravel from one UNIFIL position to another, had to interrupt its activity, with the truck proceeding to a nearby UNIFIL position south of Marwahin, while the escort team returned to its position south-east of Bayt Lif (Sector West). 31. On 23 December, Israel Defense Forces soldiers with a tank blocked a UNIFIL patrol south-east of Yarun (Sector West). The peacekeepers engaged with the Israeli soldiers but were not allowed to proceed. The patrol returned to a nearby UNIFIL position, south-west of Aytarun (Sector West). 32. On 25 December, unknown individuals fired small-arms fire over a UNIFIL patrol escorting the Lebanese Red Cross on a mission to evacuate an elderly woman, north of Yarun (Sector West).",

The convoy observed one tank, one heavily armoured combat engineering vehicle and five Israel Defense Forces soldiers, approximately 200 m to the south. The convoy withdrew from the location, moving north. Five minutes after the first shots were fired, a second sequence of three bursts was fired from the south towards the convoy. Shortly thereafter, a third burst was fired towards the convoy. At the request of the Lebanese Red Cross, the activity was cancelled, with the patrol returning to UNIFIL headquarters in Naqurah (Sector West). No casualties or damage was reported. UNIFIL protested the incident to the Israel Defense Forces. 33. On 26 December, six Israel Defense Forces soldiers stopped a UNIFIL patrol south-east of Qantarah (Sector East) and informed the peacekeepers that they could not proceed due to operations in the area. The patrol cancelled the activity and returned to its position. 34. On 29 December, the Israel Defense Forces informed UNIFIL that patrols should avoid passing near Taybah (Sector East), as the security of the peacekeepers could not be guaranteed. UNIFIL protested to the Israel Defense Forces. UNIFIL resumed patrolling in the area on 30 December. 35. On 10 January, 20 Israel Defense Force soldiers stopped a UNIFIL patrol, which was preparing to support the deployment of the Lebanese Armed Forces to a position in Salihani (Sector West), as the patrol was passing south-east of Ramiyah (Sector West). The patrol cancelled the activity and returned to its position. 36. On 14 January, a UNIFIL patrol was blocked by an Israel Defense Forces vehicle parked across the road south-east of Dayr Mimas (Sector East).

On 16 January, a UNIFIL patrol attempting to access an area to dispose of an improvised explosive device north-east of Marwahin (Sector West) was blocked by debris placed on a road by the Israel Defense Forces. The UNIFIL patrol had to wait until the roadblock was removed seven hours later before carrying out the disposal. 38. On 16 January, Israel Armed Forces soldiers with two vehicles blocked a UNIFIL patrol in the vicinity of Arab al-Luwayzah (Sector East) and told the patrol that it had to turn around. The peacekeepers cancelled the patrol and returned to their position. 39. On 17 January, 11 Israel Defense Forces soldiers with four vehicles again stopped a UNIFIL patrol south of Arab al-Luwayzah (Sector East) and instructed the patrol to turn around.

The Israel Defense Forces soldier threatened to \u201ctake action\u201d if UNIFIL and the Lebanese Armed Forces returned, stating that the position was under the control of the Israel Defense Forces. The UNIFIL patrol turned back and proceeded with another planned activity. 44. On 23 January, five individuals in civilian clothes, armed with at least three pistols and two automatic weapons, stopped a UNIFIL reconnaissance team returning from a mission in Sector East, close to the Sidon-Tyre highway (outside the area of operations). The patrol immediately alerted the Lebanese Armed Forces, which arrived at the location after about five minutes. The Lebanese Armed Forces personnel talked to the five individuals, and after approximately 15 minutes the patrol was able to continue its movement. 45. On 23 January, 11 Israel Defense Forces soldiers instructed a joint UNIFIL- Lebanese Armed Forces patrol south-west of Naqurah (Sector West) to leave the area, stating that the Israel Defense Forces were about to dispose of unexploded ordnance. UNIFIL and the Lebanese Armed Forces cancelled their patrol and left the area. 46. On 27 January, a crowd of individuals south-west of Marun al-Ra\u2019s shouted, threw stones and displayed aggressive gestures towards a UNIFIL patrol, which was conducting a joint patrol with the Lebanese Armed Forces. The Lebanese Armed Forces tried unsuccessfully to calm the crowd. After 10 minutes the peacekeepers and the Lebanese Armed Forces left the location and continued their activity on an alternative road. No injury to UNIFIL personnel was reported but a camera on one vehicle was damaged. S/2025/153 25/32 25-03537 47. On 27 January, approximately 700 individuals in the vicinity of Mays al-Jabal (Sector East) impeded the movement of a UNIFIL patrol. The patrol stopped and after 10 minutes the individuals started throwing stones towards the UNIFIL vehicles, climbed on top of them and told peacekeepers to leave. Due to the large crowd, it took the patrol 15 minutes to leave the location. The peacekeepers returned to their position. One vehicle sustained minor scratches on the windscreen. 48. On 28 January, approximately 10 individuals in civilian clothes threw stones at a UNIFIL patrol south-west of Bint Jubayl (Sector West). The patrol turned back to reach their UNIFIL position, east of Bint Jubayl, while some of the individuals followed it for a few minutes on motorcycles. No injury to peacekeepers or damage to UNIFIL property was reported. 49. On 29 January, approximately 30 individuals sitting on a road south-east of Marun al-Ra\u2019s (Sector West) blocked a UNIFIL patrol. The individuals approached the patrol and told the peacekeepers that the Israel Defense Forces had apprehended some individuals and seized an ambulance, and that they would not release the patrol until the Israel Defense Forces released the individuals. The Lebanese Armed Forces were informed and arrived at the location 30 minutes later, stating that the apprehended individuals would be released shortly. The patrol was able to leave and returned to its position, south of Marun al-Ra\u2019s (Sector West). 50. On 29 January, peacekeepers heard two rounds of gunfire fired just above their vehicles while on patrol in the vicinity of Taybah (Sector East). The peacekeepers, who had just deviated from the original itinerary due to an Israel Defense Forces roadblock, estimated that the shots originated from an approximate distance of 300 m. While advancing, the patrol encountered a second Israel Defense Forces roadblock, where Israeli soldiers warned the peacekeepers that they would open fire if they attempted to proceed. The patrol diverted and returned to its position, south of Marji\u2019yun (Sector East). 51. On 31 January, an entrance to a UNIFIL position north-west of Mays al-Jabal (Sector East) was blocked with a barbed wire fence, preventing a UNIFIL patrol\u2019s planned movement to enter the position.

Three Israel Defense Forces soldiers, two tanks and an armoured fighting vehicle were observed 300 m away from the position. The peacekeepers waited for five minutes, then turned back, and continued patrolling without concluding the planned stop at the UNIFIL position. 52. On 31 January, a UNIFIL patrol moving between Taybah and Udaysah (Sector East) encountered an Israel Defense Forces roadblock. The Israel Defense Forces soldiers told the patrol to continue towards Udaysah. Shortly thereafter, peacekeepers heard approximately 10 gunshots impacting close to their location. The patrol continued its itinerary but later encountered another Israel Defense Forces roadblock. Peacekeepers then moved along a secondary road to reach their United Nations position north-east of Dayr Kifa (Sector East). 53. On 2 February, approximately 100 individuals, acting aggressively, denied a UNIFIL patrol passage near Mays al-Jabal (Sector East). The Lebanese Armed Forces, which were part of the joint patrol, intervened but could not persuade the crowd to allow the patrol to continue. The peacekeepers interrupted the movement and returned to their position north-west of Mays al-Jabal (Sector East). 54. On 7 February, 11 young individuals with two motorcycles and two cars blocked a UNIFIL patrol, south-west of Frun (Sector East). The Lebanese Armed Forces were informed and advised that the peacekeepers should stay on main roads. The peacekeepers did not observe any weapons, nor did the individuals behave aggressively, but they refused to clear the road. The peacekeepers decided to interrupt the activity and returned to their position, north-east of Dayr Kifa (Sector East). S/2025/153 25-03537 26/32 55. On 10 February, a group of individuals on a road in the vicinity of Suwwanan (Sector East) threw stones at a UNIFIL patrol. The Lebanese Armed Forces were informed, and arrived after 10 minutes at the location and calmed the situation down. The patrol continued its planned movement. One side mirror was damaged in the incident. 56. On 14 February, a crowd ambushed a UNIFIL convoy, consisting of three vehicles and nine peacekeepers, in the southern suburbs of Beirut (outside the area of operations) (see para. 56 of the main report) as the peacekeepers were driving towards Rafic Hariri International Airport. Peacekeepers in two of the vehicles were able to escape, but the third vehicle was blocked by the crowd. The crowd set the vehicle on fire and, as fire broke out, the four peacekeepers exited the vehicle. Two peacekeepers, including the outgoing Deputy Force Commander of UNIFIL, were attacked and injured while trying to escape. The injured peacekeepers were transported to a nearby hospital where they underwent treatment. The following day, the Deputy Force Commander was able to continue his repatriation flight to his home country while the other peacekeepers returned to UNIFIL headquarters at Naqurah. 57. On 15 February, a warning shot was fired at a UNIFIL patrol by Israel Defense Force soldiers in the vicinity of a UNIFIL position north-west of \u2018Aytit (Sector West). The UNIFIL patrol quickly left the area and returned to its position, north of Dayr Kifa (Sector East). No injury to UNIFIL personnel or damage to the vehicles was reported. Impact on United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon positions and personnel 58. From 21 October to 20 February, UNIFIL positions and assets were directly or indirectly impacted on at least 39 occasions. At least 12 of these incidents had implications for UNIFIL freedom of movement. UNIFIL continued to protest to Lebanese authorities, where non-State armed groups were seen to be operating in the vicinity of UNIFIL positions. UNIFIL also protested to the Israel Defense Forces regarding incidents involving their troops. 59. On 22 October, UNIFIL peacekeepers at the permanent UNIFIL observation post in Duhayrah (Sector West) observed Israel Defense Forces soldiers conducting \u201chouse-clearing\u201d operations nearby. After the Israel Defense Forces soldiers noticed the UNIFIL peacekeepers, they fired at the peacekeepers. The peacekeepers cancelled their activity and sought shelter within the position. UNIFIL has launched an internal investigation and protested the incident to the Israel Defense Forces. The Israel Defense Forces launched an internal investigation into the incident, concluding that it could not determine whether the incident was the result of an Israel Defense Forces operation. 60.

A fire ignited but was extinguished shortly thereafter. Two peacekeepers sustained minor injuries. At the time of the incident, UNIFIL radars detected several rockets fired from the outskirts of Tyre (Sector West) in a southerly direction. UNIFIL conducted an investigation into the incident and determined that the rockets were likely fired by Hizbullah, falling short of their target. S/2025/153 27/32 25-03537 The investigation report was shared with the Lebanese Armed Forces and UNIFIL strongly protested the incident. 63.

To prevent further escalation, it is imperative that the government of Lebanon and the international community focus on curbing the smuggling of weapons, ammunition, and financial support through the Syria-Lebanon border and via air and sea routes. Since the Understandings were reached, there have been several attempts to transfer weapons and cash to Hezbollah.\u201d 3. In response to the above-mentioned letters, in a letter dated 24 January addressed to the President of the Security Council and to the Secretary-General (S/2025/55), the Permanent Representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the United Nations stated: \u201cThe Islamic Republic of Iran categorically rejects this unfounded accusation [that \u2018advanced weapon systems are being smuggled from Iran into Lebanon\u2019], which is nothing more than a pretext to justify Israel\u2019s persistent violations of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) and its blatant disregard for the ceasefire arrangements with Lebanon. [\u2026] it [Israel] fabricates such groundless allegations to legitimize its continued illegal occupation of Lebanese territory.\u201d 4. In identical letters dated 20 February addressed to the President of the Security Council and to the Secretary-General (S/2025/107), the Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations stated: \u201cSince the entry into force of the Ceasefire Understandings between the parties, Israel has reported to the mechanism hundreds of violations by Hezbollah in breach of resolution 1701 (2006) and contrary to the Ceasefire Understandings. These violations include, inter alia, continued Hezbollah military activity, including south of the Litani River, arms smuggling through the Syria-Lebanon border, money transfers through the Beirut International Airport, active weapons production facilities and launching of uncrewed aerial vehicles towards Israel.\u201d 5. The United Nations remains committed to supporting overall compliance by the parties with resolution 1701 (2006) in all its provisions and to advancing its implementation. This applies to the implementation of the arms embargo under paragraph 15 of resolution 1701 (2006) and any decision that would be adopted by the Security Council in this regard. I look forward to continued dialogue with the Council and its members on furthering our joint goal of the full implementation of resolution 1701 (2006). S/2025/153 25-03537 30/32 Annex III Mobilization of international support for the Lebanese Armed Forces 1. In paragraph 10 of its resolution 2695 (2023), the Security Council recalled paragraph 10 of its resolution 2591 (2021), in which it urged further and increased international support for the Lebanese Armed Forces, as the only legitimate armed forces of Lebanon, and all State security institutions, in response to the capabilities development plan of the Lebanese Armed Forces, as well as in the framework of the International Support Group for Lebanon, through additional and expedited assistance in areas where the Lebanese Armed Forces are most critically in need of support, including daily logistical needs and maintenance, counter-terrorism, border protection and naval capacity. 2. In identical letters dated 9 January 2024 addressed to the President of the Security Council and to the Secretary-General (A/78/712-S/2024/36), the Charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of Lebanon to the United Nations stated: \u201cThe Government of Lebanon also requests support from the United Nations to help the Lebanese State extend its authority over the entirety of Lebanese territory by strengthening its armed forces. In particular, support should be provided for deployment of those forces south of the Litani River, and they should be provided with equipment in cooperation with UNIFIL [the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon], so that there will be no weapons without the consent of the Government of Lebanon and no authority other than that of the Government of Lebanon, in accordance with paragraph 3 of resolution 1701 (2006).\u201d Subsequently, on 29 February 2024, the caretaker Prime Minister of Lebanon, Najib Mikati, stated that, to implement resolution 1701 (2006), the army would need allied countries to help with everything from \u201cfuel to equipment to means of transpo",

In the statement by the President of the Security Council of 16 January 2025 (S/PRST/2025/1), the Council called for further international assistance to strengthen State institutions, including the Lebanese Armed Forces. 4. A key aim of the International Conference in Support of Lebanon\u2019s People and Sovereignty, convened by the President of France, Emmanuel Macron, on 24 October 2024, was the mobilization of support for the Lebanese Armed Forces. According to a communiqu\u00e9 released by France, the Conference \u201cenabled the Lebanese security forces, guarantors of [Lebanon\u2019s] unity, stability and sovereignty, to be lent additional support\u201d. 5. The Announcement of a Cessation of Hostilities and Related Commitments on Enhanced Security Arrangements and Toward the Implementation of UNSCR 1701, which was circulated to the Security Council at the request of the United States of America and France (see S/2024/870), noted the intention of the United States and France to work with the Military Technical Committee for Lebanon and the wider international community to support enhanced Lebanese Armed Forces deployment to southern Lebanon and to strengthen the capabilities of the army. 6. During the reporting period, regional and global leaders have strongly advocated a surge in support to enhance the capabilities of the Lebanese Armed Forces. Similarly, Lebanese leaders have made several calls for increased international support to be channelled to the army. In his inaugural address on 9 January, the President of Lebanon, Joseph Aoun, underscored the need to invest in the Lebanese Armed Forces, including through investment from the Lebanese State itself, in order to secure the country\u2019s borders and contribute to stabilization in the south. During my S/2025/153 31/32 25-03537 visit to Lebanon in January, I also encouraged the international community to strengthen its support for the Lebanese Armed Forces. The United Nations, including the Office of the United Nations Special Coordinator for Lebanon and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), continued to leverage advocacy and engagement opportunities to highlight the funding needs of the Lebanese Armed Forces. 7. The Military Technical Committee for Lebanon was convened in Rome, on 25 November, and in Madrid, from 27 to 28 February. These meetings were attended by military representatives of France, Germany, Italy, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States, with both military and civilian officials from observer States and entities also present, including the Office of the United Nations Special Coordinator for Lebanon and UNIFIL. Representatives of the Lebanese Armed Forces participated in both meetings, providing updates on progress made in capability enhancement, the extension of State authority and support for reconstruction and service resumption in southern Lebanon, while highlighting remaining capability and financial needs. 8. Meanwhile, the Beirut Executive Committee Working Group, an in-country technical forum chaired by the United Kingdom within the overarching framework of the Military Technical Committee, which aims to enhance the coordination of bilateral efforts to support the Lebanese Armed Forces, scaled up its efforts to ensure a responsive posture following the coming into effect of the cessation of hostilities on 27 November 2024. Several sub-working groups under the auspices of the Working Group became operational during the reporting period, through which representatives of Military Technical Committee member countries and observers collaborated with representatives of the Lebanese Armed Forces in several priority areas, including strategic communications, planning and recruitment. The Office of the United Nations Special Coordinator for Lebanon and UNIFIL supported such efforts, including to enhance joint engagement with the Lebanese Armed Forces and donors to enable their timely deployment in southern Lebanon and to coordinate and align efforts with national priorities. 9.",

UNIFIL participates in four subcommittees of the Joint Supervision and Coordination Committee, constituted by the Lebanese Armed Forces in December 2024, to support the efforts to coordinate international assistance and plans with the partner nations to recruit, train, equip and deploy additional troops to southern Lebanon in support of the cessation of hostilities and resolution 1701 (2006). 10. The European Union continued its support of the Lebanese Armed Forces through a grant of \u20ac15 million, approved by the European Council on 13 November, and the announcement on 21 January of a third assistance measure from the European Peace Facility amounting to \u20ac60 million to support the Lebanese Armed Forces to \u201credeploy, secure and maintain stability\u201d in southern Lebanon, among other objectives. 11. On 16 January, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Spain, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Albares Bueno, announced that his country would provide \u20ac10 million to support the Lebanese Armed Forces. Two days later, the United States announced that it would provide \u201cmore than $117 million in new, expanded security assistance\u201d to the Lebanese Armed Forces and the Internal Security Forces, while noting that such assistance would directly support both security institutions \u201cas they work to assert Lebanese sovereignty across the country and fully implement UN Security Council Resolution 1701\u201d. Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States continued to provide in-kind support to the Lebanese Armed Forces, most of which was directed towards equipment, infrastructure and training needs. S/2025/153 25-03537 32/32 12.

Coordination fran\u00e7aise du lobby europ\u00e9en des femmes Special, 2000 Introduction Coordination fran\u00e7aise du lobby europ\u00e9en des femmes (CLEF) is a non- governmental organization that advocates for the rights of women and gender equality at the national, European and international levels. Aims and purposes of the organization CLEF spearheads a feminist network that leads and coordinates about 80 French associations campaigning for gender equality and the rights of women. Its main task is to advocate with governments and parliaments in France; with European institutions, in close collaboration with the European Women\u2019s Lobby, for which it is the French coordinator; and internationally, thanks to its consultative status with the United Nations and its agencies (Economic and Social Council status). Its mission is to defend the rights of women and promote equality and parity between women and men in all areas, legally, politically, educationally and culturally. Significant changes in the organization At the CLEF general meeting in 2022, a new board of directors, a new president and a new executive committee were elected. The new team has set out strategic priorities that are more focused on addressing violence against women and on the abolishment of prostitution. Intensifying its advocacy efforts in France, Europe and internationally, CLEF organizes awareness-raising sessions for the general public in order to combat sexist and sexual stereotypes. For example, CLEF has organized the following national events: E/C.2/2025/2/Add.2 24-20918 18/25 \u2013 An event to raise awareness on the abolition of prostitution in June 2023; \u2013 An event at which feminists could pose questions to candidates in the European elections in May 2024. Contribution of the organization to the work of the United Nations CLEF contributes to the work of the United Nations by regularly producing reports on the rights of women, in particular in France. For example, CLEF actively participated in the review by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women of the situation in France by drafting shadow reports (in 2021 and 2023) and travelling to Geneva to address the Committee\u2019s experts as part of the review (2023). CLEF also promotes the work of the United Nations and international conventions, such as Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Beijing Platform for Action, by organizing meetings and training courses for women political leaders and the general public. Participation in meetings of the United Nations CLEF attends the annual sessions of the Commission on the Status of Women and organizes several side events or parallel events on the priority theme. At the sixty-fifth session of the Commission on the Status of Women in 2021, it held a parallel event on the equal representation of women in governance bodies. At the sixty-sixth session of the Commission on the Status of Women in 2022, it co-organized a side event on the promotion of a gender perspective in efforts to combat climate change and in sustainable development, which was sponsored by Czechia, France and Sweden. At the sixty-seventh session of the Commission on the Status of Women in 2022, it held a side event on responding to the global challenges posed by pornography. Cooperation with United Nations bodies CLEF worked closely with United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women) France, which is a member of CLEF, including the organization of the CLEF International Women\u2019s Rights Forum (2021) and in the context of the festival of citizens\u2019 voices at the Generation Equality Forum (2021). We represent our member associations at the United Nations and its agencies and at the Human Rights Council in Geneva. Initiatives taken by the organization in support of the Sustainable Development Goals CLEF is taking a number of steps to attain the goal of promoting gender equality and empowering women. CLEF has been at the forefront in the fight against inequalities between women and men, in France with its network of member associations, in Europe in close collaboration with the European Women\u2019s Lobby and internationally thanks to its accreditation with the United Nations.",

Corps de r\u00e9flexion et de planification pour l\u2019utilit\u00e9 sociale (CORPUS) Special, 2012 Introduction The Corps de r\u00e9flexion et de planification pour l\u2019utilit\u00e9 sociale (CORPUS) is delighted to present its submission for the quadrennial report under the procedures of the Economic and Social Council. Since 2012, CORPUS has had special consultative status with the Council and once again reaffirms its support for all previous resolutions on the rights of the child, the most recent of which is General Assembly resolution 78/187, adopted by the Assembly at its seventy-eighth session. As a people-centred non-governmental organization based in Switzerland, CORPUS has been working for many years with institutional bodies and civil society organizations to promote human rights and address migration-related issues in Switzerland. Aims and purposes of the organization As a civil society actor, CORPUS supports and promotes the Sustainable Development Goals, which are the cornerstone of the United Nations agenda. In particular, the organization aims to support and promote the rights of the child as set out in the Convention on the Rights the Child of 20 November 1989. Significant changes in the organization In recent years, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and the war in Ukraine have had a considerable impact on the global economic situation. In view of that situation, CORPUS has had to adapt by reorganizing its strategy for implementing sustainable development projects. In-person events on the sidelines of United Nations forums were either partially held, postponed or cancelled owing to a lack of funding. At the international level, CORPUS is committed to supporting the projects of local organizations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo through the conduct of training courses. The scope of a project to clean up public places in Cotonou, as part of a memorandum of understanding with the Ministry of the Environment, was reduced to the removal of plastic waste. The project was therefore not carried out as initially planned, owing to a lack of funding. Contribution of the organization to the work of the United Nations In line with the Sustainable Development Goals, CORPUS held round tables, in compliance with the applicable health measures, on mechanisms for combating discrimination based on race or religion. Invitees included international actors, United Nations representatives and national stakeholders, including representatives of the Fribourg Cantonal Office for the Prevention of Racism, the Federal Commission on Migration and the Service for Combating Racism. In addition, the organization carried out a project to raise young people\u2019s awareness of digital technologies in order to protect them from, for example, the dangers associated with cyberbullying and the disclosure of their private lives on social media. Lastly, CORPUS welcomes its collaboration with \u201cREZO DREPANO-SS\u201d, a Congolese civil society platform set up to combat sickle cell disease, which affects E/C.2/2025/2/Add.2 24-20918 20/25 many children in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and requires more advocacy within the United Nations system. Both parties hope to build on this collaboration at forthcoming sessions in Geneva. Participation in meetings of the United Nations CORPUS has taken part in most of the sessions of the Human Rights Council, the most recent being the fifty-fourth session, held in 2023, the report on which was issued as A/HRC/54/2. During those sessions, CORPUS exchanged views with representatives of the Ministry of Human Rights of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Permanent Mission of Benin, among others. Cooperation with United Nations bodies Cooperation with United Nations bodies, in line with the principles of human rights and the Sustainable Development Goals, is crucial for the success of the work of CORPUS. In that connection, CORPUS highly appreciates the work of the NGO Liaison Unit, which is the focal point for matters concerning relations between the United Nations and non-governmental organizations.",

Droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9nergie SOS futur Special, 2004 Introduction Energy is not a given. Today hundreds of millions of people around the world still do not have access to a reliable source of energy. Accessible and affordable energy is the backbone of economic and social development in countries throughout the world. Education and health systems are vulnerable to energy deficits. It is therefore vital to take action to correct this inequality, which give rise to other inequalities. Aims and purposes of the organization Our organization, Droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9nergie SOS futur, fights for better access to sustainable energy for all, in every region of the world. We want to ensure that access to energy is recognized as an essential need; to organize international access to energy; and to enshrine the right to energy as a fundamental human right in the constitutions of every nation. Significant changes in the organization The last four years have been marked by numerous international energy meetings. We participated in the World Social Forum in Mexico, an international symposium on energy organized by the Fondation Gabriel P\u00e9ri and in meetings of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations. The production of a video enabled us to contribute to the National Day against Fuel Poverty, which takes place in France every year. We are also involved in the European Right to Energy Coalition, which fights against fuel poverty. We have renewed our governing bodies. Contribution of the organization to the work of the United Nations In recent years, we have had little involvement in United Nations activities. Our obstacle is the lack of financial resources. However, we have been very active in Europe, particularly in France and within the European Right to Energy Coalition, in which we continue to participate. E/C.2/2025/2/Add.2 23/25 24-20918 Participation in meetings of the United Nations We were unable to participate in United Nations meetings because of the health and energy crises. We are determined, as reaffirmed by our General Assembly held in Casablanca, to try to find the financial resources to enable us to participate more actively in United Nations meetings. Cooperation with United Nations bodies We actively campaign through our website and our social networks. We are also invited to numerous events to raise awareness of the importance of energy for all. We made a film to mark the twentieth anniversary of our non-governmental organization. Our General Assembly, held in Morocco in June 2023, provided an opportunity to discuss with academics the immense need for training in the energy sector. Initiatives taken by the organization in support of the Sustainable Development Goals Among the means of action we propose, we believe that the establishment of a World Day of Access to Sustainable Energy for All, as well as the recognition by the United Nations of the right to energy as a fundamental right, would contribute to improving global social and economic development. Our non-governmental organization has launched a major international petition for recognition of the right to energy, and we are currently in talks with the Canadian Government to bring this demand for recognition of the right to energy to the atten",

As communities are the decision-makers in relation to their own development projects, our support methods are based on belief in them and the human desire to be able to assess one\u2019s own resources while valuing the contributions of others. Our methods help to foster self-confidence and a sense of responsibility for decision-making. These participative initiatives are put into practice through training, meetings and exchanges, awareness-raising, advisory support, radio broadcasts, visual communication tools and action theatre. Action theatre is one of the most-used communication tools for social mobilization and advocacy. Because of its entertaining and instructive nature, theatre can bring together a large number of people who are willing to listen to awareness-raising performances in their entirety. In addition, people quickly memorize the messages that they hear in the performance. The genre facilitates thinking about development in terms of integrating all the components of society, as we cannot build a multidimensional society without an awareness of all its differences. Significant changes in the organization On 30 September 2023, Kobia held its ordinary general assembly in Ago\u00e8 D\u00e9makpo\u00e8, Ago\u00e9-Nyiv\u00e9 Prefecture. Discussions focused on a number of issues, including where we work, our areas of focus, the presentation of new members and a comprehensive report on our previous activities. Contribution of the organization to the work of the United Nations Kobia has always contributed to the organization of United Nations activities. We provide information about United Nations meetings and conferences through our communication and media networks and share that information with our delegates, representatives and members.

We also conduct awareness-raising campaigns and educational initiatives to promote the Sustainable Development Goals. Cooperation with United Nations bodies We have already received positive feedback from the United Nations at bilateral meetings, at which we have also been given valuable advice and guidance on implementing our sustainable development projects.

Association des jeunes engag\u00e9s pour l\u2019action humanitaire (AJEAH) Special, 2016 Introduction The period 2020\u20132023 was a critical one for AJEAH owing to the impacts of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Public health restrictions and economic crises disrupted the implementation of its projects, in particular in the rural areas of Togo. The organization had to adapt its methods, including through the use of digital solutions, to continue its work in spite of the lockdowns. Inequalities, especially between genders, became more pronounced, leading AJEAH to strengthen its efforts to empower women and young people. Despite these challenges, the Association remained resilient and innovative, refocusing its priorities on public health, food security and economic resilience. Through its interventions, AJEAH continued to uphold its commitment to sustainable development and human rights. Aims and purposes of the organization The organization\u2019s main goal is to improve living conditions, in particular in vulnerable areas, through targeted actions, in order to strengthen community resilience and reduce inequalities. Its mission is to contribute to the sustainable development of communities, including through poverty eradication, sustainable environmental management, the promotion of social democracy and strategic planning. The aims and purposes of AJEAH are to: 1. Promote human rights and strengthen local democracy; 2. Encourage active civic participation in public administration; 3. Combat poverty by supporting the popular economy, with a special focus on women and young people; 4. Promote environmental protection through responsible practices. These actions are aimed at creating resilient and inclusive communities and placing citizens at the heart of decision-making processes. Significant changes in the organization There have been no changes. Contribution of the organization to the work of the United Nations Between 2020 and 2023, AJEAH made a significant contribution to the work of the United Nations, in particular by working with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). AJEAH participated in consultations on governance, anti-corruption, terrorism and drug trafficking, providing local and regional perspectives, including in West Africa. The organization highlighted the importance of transparency and inclusion in governance and of the links between corruption, violent extremism and E/C.2/2025/2/Add.1 24-20917 4/23 underdevelopment. AJEAH also advocated terrorism prevention initiatives, with a specific emphasis on empowering women and young people. In the fight against drug trafficking, it called for greater international cooperation and for prevention and education programmes. AJEAH has enriched the work of UNODC with relevant recommendations based on its experience on the ground. Participation in meetings of the United Nations The organization does not have any new participation in meetings of the United Nations to report. Cooperation with United Nations bodies Between 2020 and 2023, AJEAH worked in close collaboration with UNODC on the issues of governance and anti-corruption. AJEAH participated actively in strategic consultations and discussions, providing its expertise on local challenges in terms of poor governance. The organization advocated reforms aimed at strengthening transparency and the inclusion of communities in decision-making processes. It also contributed to awareness-raising and training activities for local stakeholders, such as local authorities and members of civil society, with a view to helping them to better understand and combat corruption. In partnership with UNODC, AJEAH developed programmes for strengthening local institutions and promoting systems of participatory governance.",

Association des jeunes pour l\u2019agriculture du Mali Special, 2012 Introduction The Association des Jeunes pour l\u2019Agriculture du Mali (ASJAM) is hereby complying with Economic and Social Council resolution 1996/31, which requires non-governmental organizations (NGOs) with special consultative status to provide a brief report every four years on their activities in support of the United Nations. E/C.2/2025/2/Add.1 5/23 24-20917 Over the past four years, the work of ASJAM has focused much more on advocacy for the agricultural sector and on mobilizing young people to play an important role in that sector. ASJAM believes that there is great value in encouraging local Malian NGOs to participate in the activities of the Council and its subsidiary bodies, in accordance with paragraphs 6 and 7 of resolution 1996/31. That is why ASJAM intends to play a facilitating role over the next four years, in partnership with the Conference of Non-Governmental Organizations in Consultative Relationships with the United Nations (CoNGO) and many other partners willing to support its efforts. The present report, which is the third of its kind submitted by ASJAM, comes at a time when security crises are threatening and destabilizing not only Malian farmers, but also the country as a whole. We invite local, subregional, regional and international players to coordinate their efforts to bring lasting stability to Mali. Aims and purposes of the organization ASJAM is an apolitical association established in 2003, which works in the fields of agriculture and renewable resources. Our organization is working to significantly strengthen the agricultural sector. Our activities are linked to agriculture, energy and education. Since being granted special consultative status with the Council in 2012, ASJAM has participated in and cooperated to support the activities of United Nations system entities in order to promote both the work of the United Nations and the agricultural sector of Mali in general. Its fundamental mission is to contribute to eradicating the food crisis with a view to achieving sustainable development. Our ambition is to make Malian youth the true masters of their country\u2019s green economy. Significant changes in the organization There have been no major changes in the organization. Contribution of the organization to the work of the United Nations As a result of new information technologies, we are using the tools available to us to contribute to the work of this important communal organization.

E/C.2/2025/2/Add.1 24-20917 6/23 Cooperation with United Nations bodies There is no doubt that the United Nations has and offers opportunities for cooperation with NGOs like ASJAM. However, ASJAM has yet to cooperate significantly with the United Nations. Thus far, we have collaborated directly, and indirectly through the United Nations information centre in Ouagadougou, only with the United Nations Department of Global Communications. In order to begin to increase cooperation, ASJAM has already approached the Permanent Mission of Mali to the United Nations about organizing a thematic event on the margins of the current session of the General Assembly. Initiatives taken by the organization in support of the Sustainable Development Goals ASJAM is committed to eradicating poverty. We are working at the local level to adopt measures that will improve the mechanization of the national agricultural sector, with a view to achieving food sovereignty. Our advocacy also includes efforts related to financing for the processing of agricultural products. 4.

Association internationale de la libre pens\u00e9e Special, 2016 Introduction The Association internationale de la libre pens\u00e9e (AILP) was founded in Oslo on 10 August 2011. It aims to coordinate the activities of its member organizations and to represent the free thought movement as a whole in international institutions. On 25 July 2016, it was recognized as a non-governmental organization in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council. Aims and purposes of the organization The organization launches campaigns, which are run by its members, and issues press releases. It liaises with authorities at all levels and with partners. However, it does not carry out \u201cprojects\u201d in the way that operational non-governmental organizations do. The only activities for which it is responsible are the international congresses and other conferences that it organizes. E/C.2/2025/2/Add.1 24-20917 10/23 Significant changes in the organization The four-year period under consideration was marked by the emergence of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the subsequent restrictions on the holding of in-person meetings, as well as by the death of a representative of the AILP delegation at the Human Rights Council in Geneva, Ms. Christine Laubary-Besson (1951\u20132022). Contribution of the organization to the work of the United Nations 2020 In March 2020, during the forty-third session of the Human Rights Council, the AILP delegation informed the Council that facial recognition was an extremely invasive and dehumanizing technology, which, sooner or later, would enable constant surveillance of the public space. 2023 In a written statement dated 4 April 2023, the AILP delegation informed the Human Rights Council of the stance of the Government of France, which had expressed opposition, in the Senate, to the rehabilitation of the soldiers executed to \u201cset an example\u201d between 1914 and 1918. Articles 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights provide for the protection of individual rights in the criminal justice system. The 639 French soldiers who were shot by their own comrades, following orders designed to terrorize troops during the First World War, as a way of setting an example and without due process, did not benefit from those provisions. Participation in meetings of the United Nations At the fiftieth session of the Human Rights Council in June 2022, the AILP delegation resumed its in-person presence in Geneva and took part in the meeting of non-governmental organizations held on 29 June 2022 by the Under-Secretary- General for Policy, Volker T\u00fcrk, who had travelled from New York. AILP attended the fifty-third session of the Human Rights Council, held from June 19 to 14 July 2023. The AILP delegation, comprising H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Lortie and Philippe Besson, took part in interactive dialogues with the working groups on transnational corporations, education, climate change and trafficking in persons.",

AIEF actively participated in the activities of the United Nations Office at Geneva and maintained all its activities with that Office without interruption. Initiatives taken by the organization in support of the Sustainable Development Goals The aim of our organization is gender equality, which is one of the Sustainable Development Goals. We believe that it can be achieved by empowering women. To that end, we have held numerous meetings over the past four years. During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, we sought to hold those meetings virtually. Over the past two years, the meetings have been held in person. One such meeting was held on 21 September 2023 at the Maison Internationale des Associations in Geneva. 9.

Given the level of food insecurity experienced by internally displaced households in the Bunia and Rwampara health zones, activities were carried out to implement the project, reduce poverty and hunger, and end extreme poverty and hunger. ALDI has carried out awareness-raising with a view to promoting gender equality and empowering women, reducing infant mortality and improving maternal health. ALDI has also raised awareness of the use of biogas and reforestation for environmental protection. Partnership. Contribution of the organization to the work of the United Nations 1.

This is done through the engagement of all national and international stakeholders involved in human rights protection. Our main promotion activity is focused on the international legal instruments of the United Nations treaty bodies ratified by Member States and other national legal instruments. The Association also cooperates with the authorities of Member States regarding the promotion and protection of human rights and the exercise of civil liberties. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, which affected the world, the organization has continuously worked in synergy to better achieve its objectives. Aims and purposes of the organization The aims of our organization are to: \u2013 Create harmony among social and sociological groups and ensure respect for the concerns of a State based on human dignity as the foundation of humanity and focus of all human activity. \u2013 Work towards national and international solidarity. \u2013 Ensure respect for and protection of minorities and vulnerable groups.

This report is the second of its kind since the establishment in 2007 of the Association Un enfant un cartable du Burkina Faso, whose consultative status with the Economic and Social Council was granted in July 2016 and renewed in 2020. Aims and purposes of the organization Education and awareness-raising for stakeholders of the education ecosystem in Burkina Faso, entrepreneurship, water, hygiene and sanitation and the environment. Over the last four years, the Association and its partners have conducted awareness-raising activities in and around the cities of Ouagadougou and Bobo- Dioulasso, as well as in the rural municipalities of Oury and Siby, on the need to enrol E/C.2/2025/2/Add.1 19/23 24-20917 children, especially girls, in school. Whenever possible, we explain that the State is making great efforts in this regard and that each person can make his or her own contribution. Significant changes in the organization Based on its international activities, the Association was able to lay the foundation for the future development of the following independent organizations in the country: \u2013 Young Generation in Nuclear \u2013 Women in Nuclear \u2013 Science, technology, engineering and mathematics \u2013 Nuclear Education Skills, Sciences and Technologies Framework. The Association was granted observer status with the Basel Convention, the Rotterdam Convention and the Stockholm Convention (BRS Conventions) in 2023. Contribution of the organization to the work of the United Nations Over the last four years, the Association and its partners have conducted awareness-raising activities in and around the cities of Ouagadougou and Bobo- Dioulasso, as well as in the rural municipalities of Oury and Siby, on the need to enrol children, especially girls, in school. Whenever possible, we explain that the State is making great efforts in this regard and that each person can make his or her own contribution. We have always given the example of the Association Internationale des Etudiants en Sciences Economiques et Commerciales (AIESEC), which was founded by the President of the Association Un enfant un cartable du Burkina Faso in 1999, when he was a student. In 2004, through its trainee exchange programme, AIESEC contributed to efforts by the Ministry of Education to help make Burkina Faso eligible for funding from the $5 billion Millennium Challenge Account of the Millennium Challenge Corporation, to address the issue of gender parity in school enrolment. It was in that light that the Association Un enfant un cartable du Burkina Faso was created to make its contribution to the education sector. \u2013 It conducted training sessions on entrepreneurship, leadership and civic values in 20 junior and senior high schools in Burkina Faso, with the aim of sowing the seeds of entrepreneurship in the minds of young people, so as to enable them to start their own businesses within a few years of completing high school or university. \u2013 In the area of the environment, the Association carried out reforestation activities, planting more than 1,000 trees, with a success rate of 60 per cent. It launched a campaign to combat the proliferation of plastic bags.
