        "vents, such as wildfires, droughts and power grid failures, had become more frequent and far more deadly due to rising global temperatures. Effective governance for extreme heat at all levels was required in response. 53. Governments would be well advised to begin preparing for extreme heat events with the same sense of urgency and rigour as that associated with preparedness for other climate hazards. Vulnerable population groups with limited access to cooling, ventilation and water faced the highest level of risk during extreme heat events and should be prioritized in extreme heat policies and interventions to help to ensure that no one was left behind. E/2025/44 E/C.16/2025/9 22/26 25-06882 54. In addition to the threat to human health and safety, a direct consequence of extreme heat was an increased demand for electricity and the corresponding strain on power grids. Many power grids continued to rely largely on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas to generate electricity, which in turn contributed to climate change and an increased risk of extreme heat events. The impact of rising temperatures therefore made it imperative to accelerate the transition to renewable energy. 55. The fragmented nature of institutional responsibility for mitigating and adapting to extreme heat was cause for further concern. Preparing for rising temperatures would require strengthened collaboration and coordination among all stakeholders, including policymakers and regulators at all levels of government, as well as with the academic community, civil society and private sector actors such as insurance companies, banks and investors. Strategies to prepare for and respond to extreme heat events 56. The Committee underscored the value of effective heat action plans that set out preventive measures and response strategies during heatwaves, ensuring that vulnerable populations received the necessary protection and resources. Chief heat officers could helpfully be designated to lead interdepartmental task forces to design such action plans. The plans should include measures such as identifying triggers and warnings for extreme heat events, identifying populations at highest risk, designing targeted programmes to provide cooling shelters, setting workplace health and safety standards, including for those working in the informal sector, and providing financial support to ensure access to efficient cooling for low-income households. 57. Ensuring reliable electricity access in public institutions, including health centres and schools, was also crucial for maintaining essential services, such as healthcare and education, during extreme heat events. Those institutions might also serve as cooling centres for vulnerable populations. 58. While local governments played a vital role in such efforts, they often lacked capacity, particularly in establishing effective coordination mechanisms across departments and promoting multilevel governance structures. In addition, local governments needed to work with other stakeholders, particularly utility companies, emergency services, builders (e.g. to adapt building codes for better insulation) and energy and healthcare providers, in the design of extreme heat response plans. 59. Targeted awareness campaigns were found to be useful in educating the public and other stakeholders about sustainable urban cooling and available cooling measures (e.g. cooling centres). There was also a need to raise awareness within countries about the broader issue of extreme heat and the importance of addressing the inequalities it exacerbates. Investing in energy resilience and adaptation 60. The Committee observed that investment in modernizing power grids was required to manage increased cooling demand. Decentralized energy systems could be promoted by developing microgrids and community-level solar installations to enhance local energy autonomy. Increased investment in solar, wind and battery storage could also reduce fossil fuel dependence. Adopting energy-efficient cooling systems, including by developing new technologies, could further reduce cooling energy demand. 61. Access to international climate finance was crucial for building institutional capacity, enhancing resilience and facilitating the clean energy transition in developing countries most vulnerable to extreme heat. Subnational governments required particular support in implementing context-specific adaptation measures. E/2025/44 E/C.16/2025/9 25-06882 23/26 Reform of climate finance mechanisms and the establishment of a global heat task force could help in coordinating and accelerating action. 62. Governments, banks, institutional investors and other actors needed to develop partnerships that made it easier to finance renewable energy investments.",
        "addressed to the members of the Committee of Permanent Representatives and one to the representatives of Member States at the sixth session of the Environment Assembly, in 2024. The Inspector regrets that the participation in these surveys was insufficient to inform the analysis. This appears to be a persistent challenge also faced by UNEP management in previous surveys of representatives of Member States (for example those conducted in the context of the programme performance reports for 2022 and 2023); (f) Views of other stakeholders. The Inspector interviewed panels of experts from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the Green Climate Fund (GCF), which are the main sources of global (vertical) funds for UNEP. 10. Finalization of the report. In accordance with article 11 (2) of the statute of the Joint Inspection Unit and for quality assurance purposes, the draft report was subjected to an internal peer review to obtain comments from JIU Inspectors and to test the recommendations against the collective wisdom of the Unit. The revised report was circulated to UNEP management to correct any factual errors and provide comments on the findings, conclusions and recommendations. All types of contributions were processed with due respect for the confidentiality standards applied by JIU. The report was finalized taking into consideration all the comments received, although the final responsibility for the review rests solely with the author. 11. Recommendations. The present report is directed to UNEP executive management as well as the members of the United Nations Environment Assembly JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 25-10420 5 and the Committee of Permanent Representatives. As presented also in the concise report, the review contains eight formal recommendations, of which three are addressed to the governing bodies and five to the Executive Director. These recommendations are complemented by 27 informal recommendations (of which 18 are also found in the concise report) appearing in bold in the narrative and providing additional suggestions for reinforcing the management framework and related practices at UNEP. II. Governance framework A. Governance 12. Multi-tiered governance. The governance of the Programme must be viewed in the broader context of the United Nations system, as presented in figure II, which shows the various frameworks relevant to the organization. In addition to its own multi-tiered governance structure, as a United Nations programme, UNEP reports to the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council and to their respective subsidiary bodies for administrative and budgetary matters (the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions) and programme planning (the Committee for Programme and Coordination). The overall environmental governance framework of the system also includes the governing bodies of the multilateral environmental agreements to which UNEP provides secretariat support. Figure II United Nations Environment Programme governance framework Source: Prepared by JIU (2025). JIU/REP/2025/1 [Expanded report] 6 25-10420 United Nations Environment Assembly 13. Environment Assembly. In 2012, the General Assembly, in paragraph 4 (b) of its resolution 67/213, granted universal membership to the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme and changed its designation to the \u201cUnited Nations Environment Assembly of the United Nations Environment Programme\u201d. The Environment Assembly is considered the world\u2019s highest-level decision-making body for matters related to the environment and reports to the General Assembly. It held its first session in 2014 and meets biennially for a one-week session to set the global environmental agenda, undertake policy review and provide overarching policy guidance, set the strategic guidance on the future direction of the Programme and define policy responses to address emerging environmental challenges. The Inspector intended to assess whether this expansion of the membership had contributed to enhancing the governance process of the organization, but no conclusions were reached due to the insufficient participation of key stakeholders in the JIU online surveys. Participation in the Environment Assembly primarily gathers representatives from ministries of environment, major groups and stakeholders (such as civil society and private sector representatives), other international organizations and scientists from across the globe. A good practice identified by the Inspector is the definition of indicators linked to policymaking organs in UNEP strategic planning documents, referring to the activities of the Environment Assembly.",

        "tative of Tajikistan, recalled longstanding promotion by Tajikistan of the water and climate agenda at the global level. Tajikistan generated 98 per cent of its electricity from hydropower and planned to fully transition to renewable energy by 2032. Recognizing the critical role of glaciers in the regional climate balance, Tajikistan had spearheaded the declaration of 2025 as the International Year of Glacier Preservation. Electric vehicles were being promoted via tax incentives. Tajikistan was committed to electrifying all public transport. Ms. Joana Fisher, Deputy Permanent Representative of Portugal, highlighted the importance of long-term planning, strategic foresight, and early identification of emerging risks. Portugal was committed to carbon neutrality by 2050. The transition should encompass whole-of-government and whole-of-society efforts in order to leave no one behind, and local authorities must be empowered. Ms. Melanie Zimmerman, Acting Deputy Chief of the United States of America Mission to the United Nations, called for an end to the war in Ukraine. The United States of America advocated for a course correction on climate ideology and rejected the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals, finding them inconsistent with the sovereignty of nations. The United States of America sought a return to the original vision of the United Nations as a place for cooperation where countries could protect their sovereignty and security and promote their prosperity. ECE should not further expend valuable resources on negotiations that revolved around past resolutions and agreements. A statement in exercise of the right of reply was made by the representative of the Russian Federation. Wrapping up the discussions, the Executive Secretary expressed gratitude for the insightful contributions from delegations and the support for ECE. Increased digitalization and innovation would be essential to advance the mission of ECE. The organization continued to provide expertise on its core mandate of economic cooperation and integration. There were numerous opportunities to move forward with the actions presented, leveraging ECE strengths in standardization and policy development. Building synergies with other Geneva-based organizations would be key to maximizing shared expertise and driving collective progress. E/2025/37 E/ECE/1512 19 Annex II Item 3: Roundtables Chair\u2019s summary of the discussions A roundtable was held on the theme of \u201cAdvancing climate action and resilient infrastructure\u201d, which highlighted perspectives from member States and discussed scaling up ECE initiatives for climate action and resilient infrastructure and deepening collaboration with project financiers. The roundtable was moderated by Mr. Dario Liguti, Director of the ECE Sustainable Energy Division. In a keynote statement, Mr. Mahmoud Mohieldin, United Nations Special Envoy on Financing the 2030 Agenda, emphasized the critical intersection of nature, climate, and development amid international finance and trade challenges. Regional partnerships and collaboration were crucial in view of the issues to be discussed at the upcoming Fourth International Conference on Financing for Development. These included improving resource mobilization, optimizing investments in sustainability, and maintaining the integrity of the multilateral system. Official development assistance remained important for de-risking and capacity building. He encouraged better integration of financing for nature, climate and development through the Nationally Determined Contributions. Opening the roundtable, Mr. Dmitry Mariyasin, Deputy Executive Secretary of ECE, said that first, financing resilient infrastructure required viable, risk-based models for engaging the private sector at scale. This had to be supported by a strong dialogue with public (international finance institutions) and private (capital markets) financiers alike, to ensure resilience became part of investment projects by design. ECE had successfully supported the development of such models under its various work areas, for example through the Water Convention and the work on PPPs. Second, quality data needs to underpin development of resilient infrastructure. ECE was also leveraging technology for risk assessment and evidence-based planning, for example through the International Transport Infrastructure Observatory which hosted geographic information data on transport infrastructure networks and nodes across various modes. Third, it is key to consider social aspects of resilient infrastructure, addressed, for example, by the ECE Water and Health Protocol, and citizen involvement, for example, through the mechanisms of the Aarhus Convention.

        "well as relying on the provisions of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the SCO calls for placing environmental protection high on the global agenda. The SCO advocates a global movement for a clean and safe planet Earth to maintain a high level of commitment to addressing the adverse effects of climate change and promoting sustainable development of a green and low-emission economy. It is not acceptable to use the climate agenda to impose measures that restrict trade and investment and technological cooperation. The SCO believes that proper financing of scheduled plans in this area is crucial in the fight against climate change and calls on the developed countries to fulfill their obligations to finance climate-sensitive projects, as well as to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The efforts to establish an active dialogue with relevant international institutions to secure financing for joint projects and programs in the field of environmental protection, including the development of mountain regions, and introduction of the environmentally friendly technologies are important. ***** Summarizing the experience of the past and assessing the prospects for the future, given the trends of the modern era, the SCO firmly convinced that adoption by the international community of the Initiative \u201cOn the world unity for a just peace and harmony\u201d will contribute to global efforts to maintain peace and security, develop a dialogue, deepen friendly relations and mutually beneficial economic cooperation in order to strengthen mutual understanding and trust between peoples.

AI can bring productivity gains and increase the income of some workers, but also cause others to lose their jobs, reshaping workplace dynamics and labour demand. Moreover, technological advancements are driving automation, shifting value towards capital. However, the use of AI offers significant potential to augment worker capabilities, potentially reversing this trend and empowering workers, if supported by effective policies and strategic implementation. Through case studies, this chapter illustrates how developing countries can overcome obstacles in AI adoption to reap its benefits. It also highlights the need to place workers at the centre of technological transformation, for the inclusive adoption of AI. Technology and Innovation Report 2025 \u00a9 Gorodenkoff - Shutterstock 35 Chapter II Leveraging AI for productivity and workers\u2019 empowerment The impact of AI on work depends on a complex interplay of automation, augmentation and the creation of new roles. Policymakers should understand these dynamics to ensure the equitable distribution of AI\u2019s benefits and to support smooth workforce transitions. The adoption of AI in developing countries can be accelerated by redesigning AI solutions around locally available infrastructure; utilizing and combining new sources of data; lowering skill barriers for AI with simple interfaces; and building strategic partnerships to access essential resources for AI. Inclusive AI requires a strong emphasis on workers and their professional growth. This includes empowering them with digital literacy, supporting those transiting to new jobs with reskilling training and enhancing overall capabilities through upskilling programmes. Workers should also be involved in the design and implementation of AI tools for an integration into workspaces that addresses their needs and preserves meaningful human roles. Governments should promote human-complementary AI technologies through increased R&D funding, strategic public procurement and targeted tax incentives.",

However, their rapid and widespread diffusion is often outpacing the ability of many Governments to respond. The Technology and Innovation Report 2025: Inclusive Artificial Intelligence for Development surveys the complex artificial intelligence landscape, aiming to help decision makers design science, technology and innovation policies that foster inclusive technological progress. The use of artificial intelligence has the potential to accelerate progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, but if unevenly distributed and not guided by ethical oversight and transparency, its diffusion can exacerbate existing inequalities. The report analyses the requirements and policies needed at all stages, from development to adoption, to foster inclusive technological progress for sustainable development. This requires a multidimensional and evidence-based approach. For this purpose, three key leverage points \u2013 infrastructure, data and skills \u2013 are identified, offering a broad socioeconomic perspective and highlighting the need to build resilient infrastructure and promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and innovation. Technology and Innovation Report 2025 Inclusive Artificial Intelligence for Development Overview v The report starts by documenting the significant concentration in artificial intelligence development in a few companies and countries and identifies extensive gaps in digital infrastructure that risk widening inequalities both within and among countries. Then it explores productivity and workforce dynamics focusing on economic growth and decent work. From a national perspective, the report analyses the requirements and policies needed to support adoption, adaptation and development of artificial intelligence. From an international perspective, it considers the need for global artificial intelligence governance to steer artificial intelligence towards inclusive and equitable development, emphasizing the importance of international collaboration. History has shown that while technological progress drives economic growth, it does not on its own ensure equitable income distribution or promote inclusive human development. Stronger international cooperation can shift the focus from technology to people, enabling countries to co-create a global artificial intelligence framework. Such a framework should prioritize shared prosperity, create public goods and place humanity at the heart of artificial intelligence development.

      "question": "What are the main peacekeeping challenges mentioned in recent Security Council reports?",
      "answer": "In recent Security Council reports, several key challenges related to peacekeeping operations have been highlighted. Here are some of the main issues:\n\n1. **Fragmentation of Armed Groups**: The reports indicate a significant fragmentation among armed groups, particularly in regions like the Central African Republic (CAR) and Sudan. For instance, the midterm report from the Panel of Experts pursuant to Security Council resolution 2745 (2024) noted that the Coalition des patriotes pour le changement (CPC) faced internal divisions, leading to the emergence of new factions and complicating the security landscape. This fragmentation not only complicates peacekeeping efforts but also poses ongoing threats to stability in these regions [2].\n\n2. **Compliance with International Humanitarian Law**: There is an ongoing concern regarding the implementation of UN sanctions in compliance with international humanitarian law. The Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations emphasized the importance of humanitarian carveouts in sanctions regimes, highlighting challenges in ensuring that humanitarian actors can operate effectively without undue delays caused by overcompliance by financial institutions [1].\n\n3. **Lack of Independent Monitoring Mechanisms**: The termination of the mandate for the Panel of Experts monitoring sanctions, such as those related to the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, raises concerns about the effectiveness of sanctions regimes without independent oversight. The absence of such panels can lead to gaps in monitoring and enforcement, making it harder to ensure compliance and accountability [1].\n\n4. **Evolving Conflict Dynamics**: The reports also reflect the evolving nature of conflicts, with armed groups adapting their strategies in response to changing political and security contexts. For example, in the CAR, armed groups have shifted their financing mechanisms and operational tactics, complicating the peacekeeping landscape further [2][4].\n\n5. **Humanitarian Crises**: The humanitarian situation remains dire in many conflict-affected areas, with a significant portion of the population requiring assistance. The reports indicate that ongoing violence and instability hinder humanitarian access, which is critical for peacekeeping missions to succeed [2][4].\n\n6. **Political Will and Cooperation**: The effectiveness of peacekeeping operations is often contingent on the political will of member states and cooperation among various stakeholders. The Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations has noted the need for a comprehensive review of peacekeeping strategies to enhance their effectiveness in addressing these challenges [5].\n\nThese challenges underscore the complexity of peacekeeping operations and the need for adaptive strategies that consider the evolving nature of conflicts and the humanitarian needs of affected populations. Would you like to delve deeper into any specific aspect of these challenges?",

        "w was expressed that United Nations sanctions were to be implemented in full compliance with international humanitarian law, and the adoption of Security Council resolution 2761 (2024) was noted with appreciation. The Secretariat was asked about the impact of the humanitarian carveout to United Nations sanctions regimes, implementation challenges, and potential solutions. The representative of the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs explained that sanctions committees were required to adopt Implementation Assistance Notices and underscored the need to increase awareness of the standing humanitarian exemption. In relation to challenges to implementation, a possible risk of overcompliance by financial institutions and other actors was noted, but the representative explained that the Emergency Relief Coordinator had observed that there had been a reduction in some delays that humanitarian actors faced to deliver or carry out their activities. 18. In the context of the termination of the mandate of the Panel of Experts for the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1718 (2006), the Secretariat was asked about the implementation challenges in connection with regimes with and without panels of experts and whether any specific challenges had emerged regarding the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea sanctions regime since the Panel\u2019s termination. The representative of the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs explained that sanctions committees were mandated by the Council to monitor the implementation of sanctions, and she noted that, where there was no panel of experts, the regimes lacked an independent monitoring mechanism. It was also noted that panels were often contacted for clarification regarding the implementation of sanction regimes.",

The report was provided to the Security Council Committee pursuant to resolution 2745 (2024) on 26 December 2024 and was considered by the Committee on 11 June 2025. The Panel of Experts would appreciate it if the present letter and the midterm report were brought to the attention of the members of the Security Council and issued as a document of the Council. (Signed) Mariam Yazdani Coordinator Panel of Experts pursuant to resolution 2745 (2024) (Signed) Fadhel Bouzidi Expert (Signed) Hanna Mollan Expert (Signed) Mohamed Mamadou Diatta Expert (Signed) Fiona Mangan Expert S/2025/384 24-24567 2/74 Midterm report of the Panel of Experts pursuant to resolution 2745 (2024) Summary Armed group dynamics have continued to evolve and adapt in response to shifting political and security realities at the local, national and regional level. The main alliance of armed groups, the Coalition des patriotes pour le changement (CPC), has faced significant internal divisions, culminating in a split in August 2024, and the formation of the Coalition des patriotes pour le changement Fondamentale (CPC-F), led by the Unit\u00e9 pour la paix en Centrafrique (UPC) leader and sanctioned individual, Ali Darassa, (CFi.015). Despite tensions at the leadership level, both factions continue to coordinate their operations on the ground. Furthermore, the emergence of new armed groups, including the Coalition militaire de salut du peuple et de redressement (CMSPR), has added complexity to the security situation. These developments highlight the ongoing fragmentation of the peace process and the persistence of armed rebellion, which remain significant threats to peace and stability in the country and the wider region. Shifting armed group financing mechanisms reflect evolving local and regional changes in the political and security context. In response, armed groups have deepened their regional reach, with potential implications for their future. Since 2021, military operations and the extension of State authority have increasingly reduced the hold of armed groups over key gold and diamond mining areas and impacted their ability to tax local herders. Consequently, armed groups in western Central African Republic have become more covert in their activities, which they confined to conducting sporadic attacks. By contrast, in eastern Central African Republic, the role of armed group leaders in coordinating and leasing their fighters as mercenaries for the ongoing conflict in the Sudan has intensified, becoming a source of funding and support. During the reporting period, the Central African Republic has taken steps to address cross-border criminal activities and to regulate the natural resources trade. For instance, a new mining code was promulgated in August 2024. The General Inspectorate for Mines, alongside the Special Anti-Fraud Unit (Unit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale anti-fraude \u2013 USAF), has expanded its operations to address mining fraud. Progress has also been achieved in the implementation of the country\u2019s new border policy. In analysing illicit arms trafficking in the Central African Republic, the Panel observes that networks facilitating arms transfers remain active and could rapidly expand should external financial or material support be injected into the region, although financing for armed groups has temporarily reduced current capacity to resupply. One significant shift in tactics is the increased use of improvised explosive devices. The humanitarian situation remains challenging, with 46 per cent of the population needing assistance and protection. The moderate but continued influx of refugees from the conflict in the Sudan continued. By mid-December, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) had registered 36,591 Sudanese refugees across six prefectures in the Central African Republic.

Introduction 1. In paragraph 2 of its resolution 2725 (2024), the Security Council requested the Panel of Experts on the Sudan to provide to the Council, after discussion with the Committee, a final report by 13 January 2025 with its findings and recommendations. In the present report, the Panel outlines its findings. 2. The Panel visited Port Sudan in November 2024. It held meetings with members of the Darfurian armed movements signatories to the Juba Peace Agreement, General Ibrahim Gabir \u2013\u2060 a member of the Transitional Sovereign Council, as well as members of the General Intelligence Service, the Humanitarian Aid Commission, the Military Intelligence Service, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of the Interior, the National Coordination Mechanism,1 the Peace Commission and the Unit to Combat Violence Against Children and Women. The Panel wishes to express its appreciation to the Government of the Sudan for the support it received during the reporting period and its visit to Port Sudan. 3. In addition, the Panel held meetings and conducted telephone interviews with a number of interlocutors, including members of the Government of the Sudan, the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the Darfurian armed movements, both signatories and non-signatories to the Juba Peace Agreement, as well as representatives of civil society, including internally displaced persons, refugees, victims and eyewitnesses of violence, women\u2019s organizations and members of local communities. It also met with representatives from United Nations agencies and programmes and the diplomatic community. During its mandate, the Panel conducted visits to Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda and the United Arab Emirates. Unfortunately, despite official correspondence and engagements in New York with the Permanent Mission of Chad to the United Nations, Chad did not respond to the Panel\u2019s request to visit the border areas with Darfur. 4. The Panel worked in full conformity with the best practices and methods recommended by the Security Council Informal Working Group on General Issues of Sanctions (see S/2006/997) (see annex 1). II. Conflict dynamics A. Fragmentation and proliferation of armed actors and their war strategies 5. The fragmentation and proliferation of armed actors, as well as the overlap of military and civilian spaces, shaped the dynamics of violence. This led to widespread displacement and violations of international humanitarian law. 1. SAF and the SAF-aligned joint forces 6. In 2024, the conflict in Darfur was defined by contrasting military strategies as SAF, RSF and SAF-aligned joint forces2 vied to secure and consolidate control in the region.

      "question": "How do recent ECOSOC reports assess global economic recovery post-pandemic?",
      "answer": "To assess the global economic recovery post-pandemic based on recent ECOSOC reports, we can draw insights from the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) report and the Committee for Development Policy report.\n\n### Economic Recovery Insights\n\n1. **ESCAP Report (E/2025/39)**:\n   - The ESCAP report highlights that while many countries have made strides in economic recovery, challenges remain, particularly for middle-income countries. These nations continue to grapple with issues such as high levels of external debt, reliance on primary commodity exports, and vulnerability to climate change impacts. \n   - The report emphasizes the importance of sustainable and resilient infrastructure to facilitate recovery, noting that connectivity and equitable access are crucial for advancing development in these regions. Despite some progress in reducing poverty, a significant portion of the population in middle-income countries still lives in poverty, indicating that recovery is uneven and requires targeted interventions.\n\n2. **Committee for Development Policy Report (E/2025/33)**:\n   - This report underscores the need for a comprehensive approach to recovery that goes beyond mere economic growth metrics like GDP. It suggests that recovery strategies should incorporate social dimensions, addressing inequalities exacerbated by the pandemic. \n   - The committee stresses the importance of international cooperation and support for vulnerable countries, particularly in accessing affordable financing to meet their development needs. This aligns with the broader UN agenda of ensuring that recovery efforts are inclusive and sustainable.\n\n### Synthesis of Findings\nBoth reports indicate that while there are signs of recovery, particularly in terms of economic growth, the benefits are not evenly distributed. Middle-income countries face unique challenges that require tailored solutions, and there is a clear call for integrating social and environmental considerations into recovery strategies. The emphasis on sustainable infrastructure and equitable access reflects a shift towards a more holistic understanding of what recovery should entail.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, recent ECOSOC reports suggest that global economic recovery post-pandemic is progressing but remains fraught with challenges, particularly for middle-income and vulnerable countries. The focus is shifting towards sustainable development and inclusive growth, highlighting the need for comprehensive policies that address both economic and social dimensions of recovery. This nuanced understanding is essential for shaping effective strategies moving forward. \n\nIf you have specific aspects of the recovery or particular regions you want to explore further, feel free to ask!",
